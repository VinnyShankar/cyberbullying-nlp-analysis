Drives me a bit crazy to see that, LOL!, My wheels werenever done until 215k km, they looked better than those here, Your finger bumps took the dust off lol, Hope to see a cleaner eventually that can be used without a foam machine. Not buying a foam archive just want to be able to soeay my wheels with the cleaner from a spray bottle type. To expensive to buy a foamer and the solution., I've had my second hand car for eight years and only cleaned it now for the first time the wheel barrels by using oven cleaner and drill brush to get the same results you did., Stove cleaner is good For that stuff it cleans better than purple power, AT THE END OF THE DAY.

At least no more spittings‚Ä¶ But why stopped and what it was, that ruined my rim barrels coat. What if it was break fluid? Why im not seeing that brownish liquid in front doors, anymore?, Can break dust melt rim coat, and leave permanent scratches? Brand new car was spitting black/brown fluid from calipers area, and because i didnt have all accesories for pressure washer, inside of rims werent cleaned for about a month. After that month, all dirt in barrel, just left permanent marks of caliper or pads throwing liquid to rim. Only uncoated barrel has the marks. Outside/clear coated section is perfect. Since i picked my car from dealer, was doing this, and i was having to clean bottom of front doors, and probably above rear bumber, because i was afraid to penetrate cars clear coat. But was a black/brown thick liquid. A liquid that if you try to clean with finger on a white cars paint, you will end cleaning with water because its like brown glue‚Ä¶\\n\\nAny ideas?

So I would definitely like to see a video of using a pressure washer see what‚Äôs left and then see how good the wheel cleaner works. Thanks, I definitely would‚Äôve liked to see you hit it with the pressure washer first to see if the pressure washer would‚Äôve removed it. But thanks for a great video, Have you ever tried poorboys?

Why hasn't someone created a truly agitation free, touchless spray cleaner???, OK this is Very Unimpressive. If you watch the section between 0.52 through 0.58 you can see how easily the \"supposed 8 months of caked on brake dust\" simply wipes off with a gloved finger to reveal clean rim underneath while scraping of the pieces of tar, and even just touching the side of the rim with his thumb at 0.53 cleans off this \"Very Light Layer\" of spray on dust. A real demonstration would have started with an attempted wipe with a wet cloth, and a scrub with a stiff bristle brush or a Scotchbrite pad and soapy water just to show how tough it was to remove this grime. But hey if you viewers want to spend your money on something that is actually removing \"dirt\"? that would come off with hot soapy water go for it, but personally I wouldn't bother.

I would say your wheel product is a no go.  As an owner of a detail shop that took way too long.  The fastest way to clean that brake dust is wheel acid.  Spray on and literally 5 seconds later hit it with the pressure washer and it will look almost brand new.  No scrubbing, no gimmicks, I will make a video to show in the future.

You have red soap in your cannon bottle., My electric 2000 PSI pressure washer does exactly the same., Which won would you¬†recommend K1122TS¬†1.4 PSI/2.0 GPM¬†¬†or K1322TS 1.6 PSI/1.7 GPM¬†and why ! Thanks, Craig, I used Dawn this weekend to wash my car and it worked great., Just wondering why you didn't foam the wheels and tires more than you did?, I cant wait to buy a Kranzle.  I gotta get some customers rolling with my business first, but it will be one of my first big purchases., Did you ever start manufacturing the mobile mod for the K1322TS ?, Have you tried auto glym's ¬´Polar blast snow foam¬ª ?, the wheels looking sick bro :O  which brand is it??, Thank you, What polisher and pads  do you recommend for a beginner to do paint correction could you also  put up the link thank you always great videos üëç, I'm so jealous of that car! So awesome to see another mustang guy in the OG community., Got the same package from Matt , nothing compares to this., If 2 ounces looks like that, I would put 3 ounces I love the foam, For people who think foam cannons are all the same they are wrong, just bought the mtm foam cannon you have and foam much better than the torq foam cannon and my gallon per minute is 2.7 gm so is pretty decent so not only the power washer machine is important is also the soap and foam cannon, Hey man I‚Äôm definitely getting your new wheel cleaner but what do you recommend I use until yours comes out for my chrome wheels?, I recently bought my first pressure washer. Gas was my choice for a couple of reasons. But unless you‚Äôre new to YouTube or living in a cave, I‚Äôm surprised people don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs the gpm number that counts., I have this pressure washer and it was the best decision ever, very pricey but well worth it, it's super quiet compared to a loud gas powered one, perfect for those early morning or evening washes.  going on 2 years with 0 issues! great vid!, Why does an car wash video game not exist?, Don‚Äôt put the German price on your wheel cleaner solution., I get the same results with my 1322TS kranzle and pf22. Nothing but gobs and gobs of foam. Love it!, That's the setup to have, for sure.  One thing that really stood out to me was how quiet the Kranzle is - all I heard was the spray of the cannon but it's obviously running as you got pretty good quality foam from it.  I have neighbors who are a bit particular about noise and such too - so, once funds are available I may have to invest in the Kranzle just for that reason alone., What do you think about the Ar blue clean 630 tss? Do you know if it is silence always like this kranzle?, That power washer made me bust a nut., More it matter if I put too much water and not much soap in canon u won't get good foam and even I get great foam with my 1600 psi Lowe's pressure washer and that pressure washer for people whine professional detailer not for people with occasional wash and  to spend almost  $1000 for pressure washer just to get lil better foam doesn't worth $ in my dictionary, Ever thought about training someone haha. I'd be glad to go under you wing., I have a cheap electric pressure washer I swapped out the orfice with a 1. 1 orfice works awesome $10.00 part can't afford a 1700.00 pressure washer lol, Are those 350R wheels?, Best setup in the game rn.

Or should you clay, then polish and then apply this?, I just picked up my second bottle. I get about a month or two before I have to re apply but I love it. We just got done with the rainy season and it was really cool watching my car stay dry., Man.   It looked so easy watching you applying it.  I am having a hard time using this.  Especially trying to wipe it off.    Don‚Äôt know if I am putting too much on the pad.  Is it better to leave it on longer till it‚Äôs dry?, chemical guys no like., Can it be used on the windshield? and other windows?, I charge $450 1 step polish then apply, Have you tried the soap version of this?, Thanks a bunch for this video. I just used this on my Maverick Lariat last week. I didn't do the prep though cuz I washed my truck and applied Nexgen's ceramic spray a week before I found Hydro slick. I love this stuff too Korey! I didn't have to use a lot of it either. My truck stays outdoors cuz I live in an apartment complex and a lot of dirt flies around my area. I just have to use a microfiber cloth to wipe of the dirt, dust, whatever, and it stays slick and shiny!! I sooo recommend this product to anyone who details their own vehicle!!, I love this stuff. It's kinda expensive but the ease of use and the amount you use, it's totally worth it. It hardly takes any product, goes on super easy and wipes off easy. Doesn't leave any kinda residue in the gaps or cracks or in emblems., I do a final rinse with no sprayer on the water hose.  99.9% of the water instantly sheets off that way and is all but dry., Sold!, Does this stuff clean as it goes on? Cause I cleaned my car 100% no grime at all and after few weeks I seen I had a bunch of swirl marks all over. I even used brand new towels on it. If it's like a cleanser wax, then it must have broke loose all the very fine grime and got caught in my towelüò´, I recently bought this , and followed the directions to a t , hard to remove üòÆ, How long does it last?, How long does it last?, Great job question can you possibly do a video from start to finish on all the steps you would do prior to using this that would be great I know it probably be long but I‚Äôm sure with your magic you can condense it \\n\\nthanks a lot guys look forward to using this, our eyes work we see its micro fiber and three drops, Brother imma getting ready to apply this to my moded Scat I've got the cost of the car plus an additional 25k in mods so imma hoping the best, Man, that carbon wing is nice üî•, What product did you use when you clay the car with the girots machine, Correct me if I'm wrong but on the chemical guys channel regarding this product they say this isn't SI02 infused, Any products you recommend to strip the paint before applying this?, Good video. New subscriber, Nice Quadro !! I've been using Meguiar's  Hybrid Ceramic on an M3 and E350. I want to try this product but I just purchased a new bottle of Meguiar's. Meguiar's is doing very well, but I apply a coat .... every day almost. Not that I need to; is just my obsession. WIth that said, I'll be up for Hydroslick in about 2 weeks ;) Nice vid. Safe drives., should i use black light and then this?, That hydro slick amazing stuff. But i think FORETOO 10H Ceramic Graphene Coating\\n\\nEven better, My car has ceramic coat. Can i still apply hydroslic for additional protection and to last long the ceramic coat?, Super Super nice car,  Not into Black Wheels.....Keep up the good work. great video., Ohhhh that car is BAD!, How do you properly strip other products from paint while testing?, Good video. Go pats, Is this only for use with cars that have a ceramic coating?, Do I need to clay bar the car first and then add ceramic coat? What about polish?, You think that's amazing beading? You need to try the Aussie made \"Bowden's - Happy Ending\"... I bought it a couple months ago, and honestly I cannot find anything that offers the same level of hydrophobic Protection. I actually had a few guys taking a video of my car in the rain in a car park the other day, only because they were so amazed at how the rain literally rolled straight off the car, like a waterfall. Amazing stuff... Chemical Guys are brilliant, but this \"Happy Ending\" stuff is the ducks nuts!!!!, I bought some and it smells like spoiled garbage? Anyone else smell like this?, I love your wax videos, could you try some BILT hamber products? They‚Äôre really good performers at amazing prices. The double speed wax is famous in the UK for its amazing hydrophobics and it‚Äôs low cost of ¬£15. The auto-foam and auto-wash are also great products, really good cleaning power, I did my first A-Z exterior detail from wash to hydro slick my car, I did notice it dried quickly inside my garage (slightly warm) which gave me a slight hassle‚Ä¶ would you throw some canuba wax over it as an extra layer? I use chemical guys butter wet wax in general, Brought this stuff I don't need to do  preparation on my car as I done it a month ago so I won't need to clay or polish as it's a new car üôÉ, You got an update?, You are awesome. Love the Giulia, The \"slick\" feel comes from a silicone., I‚Äôve just came across this review video after buying a bottle of this, yes I know I should have done things the other way around but nevertheless thank you very much for a honest opinion and a proper review of this. My car is brand new and in black so I‚Äôm desperate to get this applied now after seeing your video! Subscribed just after the first video üëåüèª, You shoul use hydro charge before acording to producent to get best, Wow!  This is the most thorough review I‚Äôve ever seen on a wax.  Awesome video.  Immediately purchased a product. I know you said you‚Äôre not sponsored by them but you really should be., It‚Äôs trash after using this and had it sit for 24 hrs then the next 2 days it rained so I put it to the test yeah the water slides down great and on the windows but I have a black suv and after taking it for a test drive for a hour in the rain and parked it came back out side I had dry dusted spots all over my suv doors and back bumper smdh I said I was going to take it back to get my money back this shit is only good for ppl that doesn‚Äôt get rained every day in they city, Sponsored by Eco blower., Stupid question. Do you have to have your vehicle vehicle coated to use this product?, Can you use a machine with this product? Or is it meant to be applied by hand?, What do you do to prep the car? Could you guide me ü•≤, would you say this is better than their butter wax? i want a easy to use liquid wax to apply after sealent so i was going to go for Butter Wax but your review of this seems good and basically the same application and results, What tire shine you use, Chemical Guys is a joke. They have good products, however their customer service is literally non existent, by phone, email, or website. They don‚Äôt care. You have a problem with your shipment or product, you are on your own and out of the money you spent. I will never do business with Chemical Guys again. The Better Business Bureau has numerous complaints filed against Chemical Guys for this exact issue. Do business with them at your own risk., Chemical Guys hyper slick. very easy to use.  Last 2x  longer than Meguiar's Ultimate wax., I put this on one of my fleet vehicles that frequently travel 40 miles a week on a desert washboard road. Since using this product I have never needed nothing more than water to wash the dust off including the windows. Have since applied to a fleet of 15 Lincoln hybrids. The drivers told me they've seen more tips since!, I just purchased a brand new car. I am wondering if I can use that product on my car in order to see it shine?, Getting this in a couple of days, If this works on my RC cars I‚Äôll try it on my car, wow that looks sick!, What's the difference between HydroSlick and JetSeal ? I am kind of confused, Can you use this with the CG Blacklight? Would the HydroSlick be used after the blacklight to seal?, What are you using in the spray bottle to decontaminate the surface?  You said it so quick I couldn't make it out., That's like impossible to do in places like all of fl and Seattle cuz it rains all the damn time.ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, i love mine no issues,, LOL send me your fusso coat.. i need that :P, Great demo, thank you for showing us a great product., This vs 007 Gloss Enhancer?, OUTSTANDING COMMENTARY. THANK YOU !!!!!, I ran out of F11 top coat and started using Silk Shine dressing because it had uV protection etc, I wrote chemical guys to ask if the slick an upgrade to the silk and he was like no they‚Äôre two different products, unaware like wow! I say all this because I have been using the SILK and it washes off dirt with ease like nothing before , I wrote the chemical guys guy back with what I was using on my whole car (yellow corvette) windows also and he stopped replying üòÇ did I just find out their new product formula???, I got it from autozone for $50.. :(.. the trick of it is to apply a thin layer., thick layer reacts as a coagulation and it just peel off of the surface, and I believe doesn‚Äôt do his job when that happens,, ( just my opinion)., I'm a novice with wax and ceramic coating. I have a black Infiniti Q50 do you have any advice about washing, waxing and ceramic coating. Im worried about swirl marks and scratches., Watched a bunch of your reviews. Really thorough and no bias any way. Love it! Keep up the good work!, Is this stuff safe for plastics and glass?, $40 at Wal Mart....but it's worth it., Awesome video! Thanks! Saw it at WalMart today and I was surprised!, What tire dressing do you use man? Very nice!, how does it hold up compared to something like Nufinish?, Stuff works great first applied but after 2 washes or so bottom panels have no sheeting or anything. At least in my experience and real world driving ( south florida) won't last a month, alot of better alternatives out there for half the price., Chemical Guys make great products but they're highly overpriced., Just finished restoration on my 1991 F150, used Sikkens paint so it had a pretty deep shine to start with. I've used Chemical Guys V07 Spray Sealant on it with great results (LOVE it). So I wanted something to put on the paint that would withstand the truck sitting outside in the elements (put my wife's car back in the garage, Lol). So I applied the HYDRO-SLICK (easy on, moderately easy to take off). The DEPTH of shine is absolutely off the charts, I've never used anything that has as CRISP &amp; BRILLIANT shine as Hydro-Slick, I am completely amazed. Now I just put it on 2 days ago, so time will tell as far as durability, but in my opinion the shine itself is well worth the $ price $ of this product. I really like Chemical Guys products &amp; no I don't get anything for this review besides a PHENOMENAL shine!!! Hope this review helps anyone considering,  you won't be disappointed., Doesnt work for long. And they advertise 12months lmao, I strongly recommend Dri wash n guard, Just tried it. Excellent product, I noticed you didn't use your GT350R. Do you think this Hydro Slick would be harmful to apply over the stripes?, Junk, $40 a bottle one wash and gone. Was expecting a lot better results for the price., For all of these kinds of waxes, must you remove any previous waxes? ie.; wash your car with dish soap to strip, Great review. I just used this on my Jeep GC Overland and it‚Äôs amazing., Can you use this on a non ceramic coated car?, Wow that's such a beautiful car! Everytime I see them, I fall in love all over again. Alfa really hit it out of the park, This stuff is pure trash and a waste of money i use it don't buy you will regret it don't believe the hype, Clicked on the video to see what someone else thought of this, I recently used it on my Giulia. Then I saw you have a QV!, Question. This only if car coated or is okay to use if after claying?, You think you can just use this by itself? Thinking of getting this for my black ram but applying like 2-3 coats on it. Not sure how I‚Äôll know when to put a new coat on. And when that happens will I have to strip the paint clean just to put on a new coat?, I bought one bottle of this. First time using it and I really like it. Smells like a candle with candy üòÇüòÇ\\n\\nI bought it for 20$ Only!!, So would this be a good addition to the layer over the turtle wax ceramic coating spray? Or is that overkill?, I'm wanting to see the product in action before I shell out $40 for it., I just used it on a black 1997 ford mustard but I should have used panel wipe before applying. I will find out! but I hope it holds up i did compound and polish the paint so it should be okay, can you buy it in Canada anywhere.., I normally like to stay away from chemical guys products but I may have to give this a shot, ...]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[Hey australian Elon Musk can you show a little more car and less face? No offense., Hips on the 997 üòç, 4 years later the tables have turned. More and more I hear people actually prefer the 996.1 over the 996.2 or 997., I‚Äôve a 996 now which I love, I‚Äôve had a 997 which again was great, I prefer the 996 interior as it‚Äôs less German than the 997, regarding the headlights I love them both, what‚Äôs not to like they are 911‚Äôs !!, I like the 996 styling better all around... but I guess that's why I own one. lol., It‚Äôs a joke how expensive the 996 is in Australia., Just saw this vid. I recently purchased a 987.1 Boxster, Black Metallic, Sand Beige interior. I had a '00 986 Boxster previously. I concur with a lot of your findings, the 997/987 is a better car, more refined. I'm enjoying my 987.1 Boxster here in the Brainerd Lakes area, Central MN. It gets a lot of looks and comments, as it's a rare car here. Enjoying your vids., great zeds dead at the start, Interesting attempt to compare but sounds more like another ‚Äúlet‚Äôs beat up on the 996‚Äù review., There is no 933. üò¨, 996 is a pain in the eyes ü§™, Still liking your 997, James.  :)  But glad you are enjoying your 991.  I need to drive my 997.1 Turbo more., Really surprised you didn‚Äôt even mention one of the biggest interior difference, which is the center console. Do you prefer the way that looks over the 996? I do, big time. The 996 interior looks almost Japanese to me and hasn‚Äôt aged nearly as well., Ha ha ha ha you mean Volkswagen bug eyes that‚Äôs what a lot of people call in the street 997 also known as Herbie eyes, I still remember back in 1999, when I got to be a passenger in a 996.  It was at night, I was amazed how well the headlights WORKED, remember for 1999 they were very advanced., You buy a Porsche then you get the boring one twice are u really happy? Let me ask u this if I offered u half a slice of ur favrout cake or a loaf of dry bread? U do see what I mean right but hey I love Porsche that's why I might be seeing it like so I mean the least a turbo, That was cruel,  my dog thinks he‚Äôs kinda cute!, Someone should have done an affordable / cool, conversion kit for the 996, to update the headlights.  Would have sold well for sure., The bumperettes are only there due to the narrower USA license plate. Same with the 928. Personally I love them!, I need some aspirin after listening to that music., Why are you opposed to the Gundo hack?, Gundo hack all the way! The interior colour of your car hasn't aged well imo. Good vid., I currently own both a 03‚Äô 996.2 and an 08‚Äô 997.1.  996.2 definitely looks and feels more vintage even though it‚Äôs only 5 years younger.  The 997.1 more modern on outside and inside.  The driving on 996.2 is more fun on the lower gears.  It has that Porsche sound when you accelerate.  While the 997.1 runs more steady and solid without the howling of the 996.2.  I bought the 997.1 first as my DD then I wanted a lower priced 911 to alternate as DD so I went with a high mileage 996.2.  Overall, if I had to pick one, I would choose the 997.1 BUT I would easily miss the 996.2 howl acceleration sound.  That sound is pure Porsche music., You said ‚Äúum‚Äù thousands of times, The bumperettes are to be in compliance with the American 5mph bumper laws., You don't see the headlights when you are driving :), The 996 is unique in styling among 911's and feel that in itself will make it a future classic (especially 4S's, Turbo's and GT's) as no other 911 looks quite like it, the 997 is a handsome car but the interior feels a bit square and more built for the production line since the vw takeover and the rear end of the car I feel looks worse than its predecessor. I guess in the future the 997 will feel like and older cheaper 991 while the 996 feels like a completely different car in its own right, not better not worse just unique and will have its own fans., i like the garage floors... any idea?, I prefer the gen 1 996 headlights to the gen 2. Maybe I‚Äôm crazy, or maybe it‚Äôs because i fell in love with Porsche with the original 996., I prefer the first gen 996 over the 997. The 1999 996 to me is the perfect 911. It had the perfect blend of the old world and the new, with just enough technology to keep you safe but not so much to drive you nuts. Pinky Lai designed the 996 and he knew what he was doing. The 996 has a cleaner, leaner body style and a nicely laid out simple interior with no gimmicky buttons all over the place., i like everything about the 997 but the interior and steering wheel. 2003 996 C2 here in all Black., Just a note on the slim vs fat ass design. The original 911 was a slim ass design. Much more so than the base 996. But the wide ass RS and Turbo models are the iconic ones, aren't they?, Big difference in the steering wheel is that the 996 wheel did not tilt; the 997 wheel does.  Huge if you're over 6'.  Also, where did you get the PORSCHE lettering on the rear lid?  That's not stock as far as I know but I like it., You said you‚Äôre a big guy. How tall exactly? I‚Äôm about 6‚Äô5‚Äù but slim and thinking about a 996 or 997 and am wondering what chance I have to fit in one comfortably, FYI the bumper adds are not for the smaller licence plates, it's because of different crash requirements US vs. Europe. That's why., As a current 1999 996 owner, I crave a 80's air cooled 911 over a 996 and 997 any day., after I had an F Modell, a G Model and a 964 ¬†(all second hand) I bought a brand new 996 Carrera 2 in 2003 that I still own. It is the most reliable 911 I ever had. Stil a pure pleasure to drive and it looks and feels like brand new. I like the 991 but I feel disgusted about the \"tuned engine sond\" like many new cars have. It just doesn`t sound true..., 996 look great when they are dropped with a set of coilovers. Overall the design works better with the lower nose and lower rear hip line than on 997. Just my opinion..., I have the memory seats on my 987 boxster...but no sports chrono.  Maybe a difference in package between 911 and boxster?, Nice piece. But you make a big deal about the 'bumperettes'. Let me tell you from first hand experience, my good man, that you most certainly WANT those bumperettes. I was at a stop sign, moved a few inches ahead to see traffic, and had the person behind me thinking that I was going for the opening. WHAM! Bumped me so hard that I could not believe it that there was no damage, so much so that I took the car to have it looked at by my mechanic who was happy to report that I had dodged a bullet. No damage. Now I was lucky that the bumpers happened to line up, otherwise this minor traffic incident would have turned into something ugly. Thank Zuffenhausen for those bumperettes. And take pity upun the 991 owners, who will be crying into their beer over even a 4 mph bump. Cheers., The headlights on the 997 are nothing like the \"iconic original 911 lights\" - they are a modern equivalent - they slope back and not sit up like originals so look very different to me. I think the front  of the 996.2 is more sporty and aerodynamic and i prefer the lights to the 997's- like you say unique and will never be copied again = a one of!!  Also the 996 still looks slim/sporty/sleek unlike the 997 which is starting to look BIG a big butt!!!  and the 991 - please= huge., It's the 996 for me all day long and especially in seal grey. And on the plus side, they're much cheaper., The 996 headlights were good enough for the 996 GT1 LeMans and street version car. Only the amber blinker versions looked bad, the litronic and clear versions were cool., I am biased because I have an 02 996, but I really like the lights as well.  They really don't bother me.  Cheers on a great video., Quick comment on the seat memory. I too am the only one that drives my vehicle but every time I take my car in for service it never fails, the seat is moved. I tell them don't get comfortable because they are not moving in but they always succeed in moving my seat. Same happens when the carwash service comes around, they are only driving to the back of the parking lot, 100 yards at the most... As I always tell my wife, don't mess with my switches!\\n\\nNice video btw!, Just to let you know, i have Fabspeed exhaust and intake in my 997 Carrara Cabrio and it's AMAZING! But to be honest all you need is the intake.  It makes an amazing sound above 5000rpm that i believe will leave you smiling from ear to ear...   Keep those excellent videos coming..., Is that ribtrax on the floor?, Good comparison with a thorough explanation of the differences.  I spent the morning at the local dealer looking at a 997.2, C4S I spotted at the rear of the dealers service lot.  it had a sign on the dash saying, \"Not For Sale, Smog and Safety service required.\"  The sales guys said I could buy it although it was taken in on trade just yesterday, and the exterior is still dirty.  And it obviously still needs to be serviced.  The interior is in very nice condition, and clean.  Anyway, I'll probably go back tomorrow morning and put a deposit on it,  since I'm sure it'll sell before it gets out to the front of the dealers lot.   Wish me luck!\\nLooking forward to your on road comparison!, Nice! Anything you prefer about the 996, or 997 better all round?]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[Excellent tutorial video. Congrats! Maybe two things you could emphasize also: a) don't forget to replug the fiber cable (if you have any) from the original to the Joyeauto harness and b) definitely look for a fuse socket that switches with the ignition if you don't want to ruin your car battery. :-), Do you find the box beneath the steering column interferes with moving the steering wheel?, No offense to your excellent video, but this one is the best I have seen - though it is for a different product, which admittedly has fewer parts to it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwnwfwTsFTQ, Does anyone know someone in the Dallas area that I could pay to complete this install??, Just want to echo George P's thought below. Got my JoyeAuto unit a couple weeks ago and got around to installing it today. This video was fantastic, took me maybe 3 hours and I was going slow. Perfect on the first try, except I initially didn't have sound until I realized I needed to set the input to AUX. LOL.\\n\\nThank you so much for making this great tutorial!\\n\\nEDIT--one lesson learned was that I decided to re-mount the JoyeAuto processing box in the upper left area of the footwell just beyond the fuse box. I found that the wires were getting caught in the, I don't know what to call it--the pivot point of the steering column. This way it's completely out of the way of the steering column., Hi there, I have been using the JoyeAuto unit for about a year and wanted to provide some feedback and tips I learned in the process.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have the following configuration:\\r\\n\\r\\n2015 base 911 carrera US\\r\\n7 speed\\r\\nBose system\\r\\nNo cameras\\r\\nPixel 6 Pro phone using android auto wireless\\r\\n\\r\\nIssues:\\r\\n\\r\\nPower.  If you want the unit to stay powered up after the car turns off, then you can't use the normal switched power options available in the driver side fuse box.  Alternatively, if you use the fulltime powered fuse locations, the unit stays on 100% of the time which creates other problems (battery drain and the phone may stay connected depending on car location vs. phone).  The solution is to use a particular fuse location in the passenger side (right) footwell:  D9.  This means running a longer length of wire if you have the JoyeAuto box in the driver's (left hand) side, but well worth having the best of both worlds.  Once in place, the unit will power up as soon as the car is unlocked and power down about 20-30 minutes after the key is pulled from the ignition.\\r\\nI'm surprised this isn't mentioned by more people but maybe they just live with the loss of power when the engine is turned off when using the left hand fuse box options.  Or maybe there's some other factor at play I missed.  Please comment if you have a different experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoot flakiness.  The normal boot sequence when getting in the car is to hit the Navi button to engage the JoyeAuto system.  It then auto detects the previous Android Auto connection and displays it on the screen to be selected.  On some occasions the phone doesn't show up to be selected but it was still found by JoyeAuto (I don't know if this is a timeout issue or something else) which is evident from the Android button being highlighted in purple.  In this case, you have to go into the setup menu, choose the bottom left most option (Smart Phone), Wireless AA, and the phone is in the list to be selected for boot.  I have tried to skip all this and simply select the purple Android button but then it gets hung up requiring me to fiddle with my phone (usually going airplane mode and back restores things).  Since the unit stays on even with power off, you'd have to resort to more manual power off options like accessing the JoyeAuto unit or the fuse box, neither option of which is pretty.  Lesson there is not to attempt booting without actually selecting the connected phone.  The little green \"link\" icon can also cause this problem if the phone hasn't been selected already.\\r\\nIf someone can improve upon this experience please share.\\r\\n\\r\\nBT connection and Mic issues.  The provided Mic is weak and will create sound quality issues for phone calls.  Adjusting it to help phone calls can have a detrimental effect on Hey Google.  The workaround, which others have also mentioned, is to use the built-in car PCM for phone calls.  That means the phone will have two simultaneous connections when in the car:  JoyeAuto and PCM.  The trick is to use the latter for phone calls which isn't always the default (I'm not sure how android prioritizes and/or saves them).  And you can't disable or forget JoyeAuto from the phone because Android Auto seems to reinstate it, if only partially (forgetting should wipe it out but it sticks around zombie like).  For a time, I was dynamically entering the IDCore setup menu and disabling BT from there which worked, but I'd have to re-establish the BT connection manually (like start of day) on car start each time which sucked.  I since learned Android offers an option to select which BT connection is active for a call in the BT menu.  But that only presents itself during the call, so if you think the JoyeAuto BT connection is active you have to quickly go into the phone menu and select PCM as the \"active connection\".  The Android Auto touch screen has the option to select the speakerphone during the call which might prove helpful as a quick save while fiddling on the phone...\\r\\nThe good news is I don't find myself doing this very often, so the phone seems to try to re-use the last connection if it's there.  If anyone has a more reliable way to keep PCM as the primary phone connection let us know.\\r\\n\\r\\nSound quality.  There's been a lot of discussion on this topic and of course it's difficult to describe other than maybe poor sound, tinny, distorted, etc.  And this all depends on the type of music being played.  Some tips here include the use of the JoyeAuto EQ menu dynamically (while the music is being played).  You can actually start playing music and exit the AA screen (select IDCore or Exit from the list of programs) which gets you back to the boot menu where Setup can be chosen.  From there just go into the EQ menu, choose the settings icon to \"tab over\" into the EQ screen and select accordingly (while the music is playing).  This should help tune the system more quickly by going in and out of the AA screen to choose different music and coming back into EQ settings.  Note, that little green link icon is now your friend to get you back into the main AA screen.  \\r\\nPersonally, I got bass distortion when enabling the loudness option and also had to lower the 60/150hz settings but maybe that's my music again, or just taste.  I have attached pictures with my settings fwiw.  YMMV, but I would like to hear back from others on their precise EQ settings (including loudness/subwoofer) just the same.  There may be something optimal out there.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuilt-in Mic.  Once PCM is setup for phone calls, the Mic settings can be optimized around clearly picking up voice command instructions (vs. compromising for echo, etc.).  A higher sensitivity level works better but I must say it's still not great in my car.  A speed with the background road noise the voice command is garbled and I get poor results.  This could be that my tires are louder and need replacing or Mic placement (perpendicular off the steering column just out of eye level sight) so again YMMV.  \\r\\nIf anyone has any tips to share here, let us know.\\r\\n\\r\\nSummary.\\r\\nOverall, I am personally very happy with the value the JoyeAuto system provides but I must admit I would not be able to recommend this to people who are not tech savvy since it requires a bit of know-how to workaround the flakiness when it presents (which is about 15% of the time).  The workarounds are not onerous, but to somebody who expects things to just work, it's a deal killer.  If we can improve on my experiences above maybe the system can get more stable and be fit for the masses., Thanks for the great tutorial James! I'm thinking of buying the kit and install it myself, is this kit something you would still recommend? Or would you suggest looking at other options?, Your video was truly helpful! Thank you.\\nHowever, after installation, this module has discharged two batteries already (one - I thought it was old, two - I realized it was the radio). Do you know if I have done something wrong? I'm thinking on returning it back now...\\nThanks!!, My favorite part was where you spread the wiring harnesses out on the workbench to make the wiring diagram come to life. Excellent!, Wow - this is one of the best DIY vids I've seen! I don't know if you've discouraged me or encouraged me!  \\nüëç How did you end up securing the unit under the dash. Also, what is the purpose of the USB Cable?, I just wanted to say a MASSIVE THANK YOU and SERIOUSLY WELL DONE for taking the time and effort to produce this video!! You are a HERO!! Having watched this I was able to complete my install in a little over 2hrs and without a need to even consult the very minimalistic and poorly worded instructions / diagram that it came with. As another commenter has suggested, the only thing to add would be that of ensuring to pick an appropriate Fuse Port for the power. I initially used one in Row A which I then realised was continuous power (for the alarm, immobiliser etc) and would not only draw unnecessarily on the battery when parked, but also meant that the WiFi on the JoyeAuto wasn't working and I couldn't get it to pair with my phone as a result (maybe a low voltage issue...?? not sure). Anyway, I then moved it to a free Fuse Port in Row C and it worked straight away and only now has power on ignition as well. Lastly I cut my hands to bits and sweated hard over about 45 mins to feed the USB cable around the back of (and into) the glovebox...not fun at all but sits neatly out of the way in there now (personal preference). I also cable-tied / zip-tied the excess cable lengths together and then tied these up behind the steering dash...I did the same with the JoyeAuto control box too...just keeps them neatly out of sight and avoids any risk of them slipping / dropping down into the footwell and fouling the pedals while you're driving (that wouldn't be ideal!!). Anyway...back to my original reason for commenting...thank you so much, you've been an absolute saviour with this video!!, Thank you for the DIY. After watching your videos I went and purchased the Joyeauto for my 981 Cayman. Question, does your interface box stay on after you turn off the car. My head unit turned off automatically when I turned off the car but the interface box with the blue light stayed on. Just wondering if it is supposed to be that way or if I have a bad unit. Any help would be greatly appreciated., I am getting some screen flickering when the environment is dim and the screen tries to auto adjust the brightness, are you getting this issue?, Nice tounge...yikes, Hi there\\n\\nI have tried to fit this to my 991.1 targa , but i have hit a problem !\\nThe head unit switches off with an alert from the dash saying SWITCHES DEACTIVATED. So after maybe ten attempts to start the head unit its now not working .\\nI noticed that i have 2 small pins in the head unit that the Joyeauto harness hasn‚Äôt and the original harness has a blue flashing light that matches into the head unit.\\n\\nAny ideas going forward, One small update I'd like is to have the ability to autostart androidauto when it recognizes it. It bugs me that I have to click into it every time or else it won't boot-up into AndroidAuto. Does anyone have any tips?, Update: Local car stereo shop quoted me 4 to 6 hours to install the rear camera option on the Joy Auto mod at $150 per hour. So I studied several more videos and stuck my borescope camera into various nooks and crannies. I decided I could do it for less t6han $600. Took off the bumper and ran my wires around the RIGHT side of the car went behind the taillight. and into the rubber seals being careful to keep the wires clear of convertible top guillotines. then i tested the camera and Oh Joy! it works great. even hast the little car silhouette when you get close to an immoveable object. Went to my local market to get some essential items (butter and Glenlivet) and when I got back to the car I noticed the rear windows were still down with the top up. I hadn't noticed when i parked and put the top up, but the front windows didn't come up when the top reached full lock but came up with the switches. So happy with Carplay mod and rear camera but cant live with back windows down. What did I do wrong.BTW, I am going to stow the JA box to the passenger side beneath the kick panel were you access the cabin air filter., Just ran into two hitches. First the good news: kit now ships with double standoffs to get the board up higher. the bad news, they appear to have changed the Sirius antenna connector and nit now is still too high. So, I temp pulled the Sirius board. Secondly, I am having a very hard time getting the fiber optic (Bose) out of the original connector. I dont want to mess them up because replacement would be hell.  how did you or anybody get them out&gt;, Por Sha, Hi, i have just installed the Joyeauto to my cayenne following your video. Thanx a lot. ƒ∞ just wonder that the HDMI port is working or not?, It has terrible sound quality via AUX., The main unit is nice &amp; compact compared to the MMI &amp; AMI boxes used in other car makes., Pat, nice work.  Would you be willing to do an install for me?  How can I contact you?, hallo is it possible to install blothoch back camera ?, Thank you Mate! you just made my day, I'm picking up a 2015 911 on Monday and this is the 1st mod I'm going to do!, Just ordered the joyeauto kit for my 2014 991 Turbo S and I'm excited to do this project.  Your video  very much lessens the fear and reluctance to dive into the project.  Excellent video!, Great installation video. I‚Äôm tempted to do this soon., My 2016 Cayman came with a rearview camera, but I can't get it to work with the JoyeAuto CarPlay no matter what settings are on the box.  With one setting it comes on in Drive, but I can't get it to work when in reverse.  Any suggestions?, Does anyone else have a BT skipping problem with their iPhone? Will this addition fix that BT problem?, Great guide. One question, does this disable the pcm maps on the head unit or the dial display?, great Video. I had to reconfigure the switches on the external gadget and everything works well and connects with any iPhone. the only issue I'm facing now is connecting it to my android. Nothing I did worked till now. Any tips out there to help me fix this problem??, I think I've drained my battery not putting in the right place. Can you please tell me which port it needs to go into, If you can, I can‚Ä¶. Thanks for the confidence, I've followed your video but my sound not working at all, Thanks for this.  So how is the joyeauto performing so far?  Any issues?, Great video! Very informative ü§ôüèΩ, BEST VIDEO IN THE WORLD \\nMORE VIDEOS PLEASE MASTER CARPLAY HHH\\nGOOD MAN, Not going to like this as you have exactly 911 likes hahahaha, This video was so helpful during my install. Huge, this is the best apple car play video. in his 6 month review he also notes that if you have the Bose system you have to unplug the optic cables from the Porsche Harness and put then into the Joyeauto harness because this type of cable can't be extended. Real pain. It took my friend and I forever to figure out why we weren't getting audio. Joyeauto now includes 2 sets of extenders so people with the XM Radio can secure it properly.  Another tip: get some felt tape to put between the XM board and the Joyeauto board that goes in the PCM., I just installed the JoyeAuto in my 991.1 yesterday. I couldn‚Äôt have done it without your great videos. My only snafu was removing the orange Bose wiring and then mistakenly reinstalling it in the same place. I do have one question. You mentioned secured the box with zip-ties. Do you have any suggested in this regard?, Just completed the install in my 2014 911.  Thank you for the tutorial. It only took me about 1 hr to complete thanks to your great video and tips., Cheers for Video bro made fitting mine a-lot easer .long story short i watched your vid 2 or 3 times then attempted doing mine the 1st time i fitted it all worked ok but the green and red and blue looked abit washed out ie faded .so i thought ahh that something to do with RGB to the screen .any way next weekend i removed it and took it all apart and re did all the flat ribbon cables and made shure the video out plug on the new daughter board was fully seated .Stuck it all back together refitted back in the car .this time no car play at all  ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø again removed the whole unit undid the PCM unit checked all the ribbons again stuck it back together then fitted it for the 3rd time lol .it worked perfectly all the vibrant colors as it should been the 1st time even thought it was a right pain the ++++ it was still worth doing ohh and i removed the PCM harddrive that located on the top of the unit cloned that with a SSD hard drive and put the original in a safe place  ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø cheers again bud, Excellent video, I'm just working through this and it worked first time. The only issue I have is getting the PCM unit back in to the dash, the extra wiring is stopping it going all the way in. Any tips on this?, Just purchased my Mine can‚Äôt wait to install, Does the audio quality suffer w/ CarPlay vs the PCM radio?, Hello, thanks for the video, I have one question, after the installation, do you still have the map on the dashboard gages ? Thanks, Hilarious, what a great tutorial and video!  Much appreciated. Very suave accent too., Hi James. great video! i have one install in my wife Macan and everything works really well except when she calls from her car the receiver of call hears and echo of their voice coming back to them.\\nJust wondering if you have any suggestions please?, Could u also add a backup camera?, Is anyone having issues due to the burmester sound system with this apple CarPlay, Definitely looking into this. I want car play for my Macan so bad, Any links to some good porsche forums?, Very impressive tutorial! Am surprised the OEM Porsche head unit is able to be disassembled; I would‚Äôve thought it would be a single monolithic unit., I nick, Thanks for the tuto, very easy to install.\\nJust a question, After about 48hours, my battery is done, the joyeauto stay on After I turn off the car, Thanks for your answere and sorry for my bad english., I just bought one and the screen doesn‚Äôt turns on but it has sound, so you know why does that happen and do you know how to fix it?, off to tackle my install tomorrow on my boxster.   watched the video several times o i hope im ready.  great video, Great video mate, attempting this one my gt4.\\nHave you got a scouse twang to your accent ??, I don‚Äôt have a GPS on my Macan s , will I still works?, will the factory installed back up camera continue to work after the installation?, This is fantastic post. Thank you., Hi all\\nAnyone have experienced loosing back up camera after installing this CarPlay. It was good for few weeks but if I drive the car more than 20 minutes then I loose back up camera. I read the Joyauto CarPlay get too hot and this causes some malfunctioning. And solution?\\nThanks, Excellent vid ü•Ç very informative. Does this system work with the Kayenne, it‚Äôs 2012 with Bose.  Thanks in advance üëç, I installed everything correctly but my screen is not powering on at all.    I tried my original harness and it works so the ribbons are connected properly. Just not drawing juice from the joyeauto harness, Is there a solution like this for my 2008 997.1?, Exceptional video.. About to collect a 2016 Cayman GTS and hope to do the same; whether I do it get it done, let's see but you've done an amazing, well presented and instructional video. Thank you\\nJust have to add that if ANYONE has done this to their 981 Cayman or Boxster, how well did it go and was there space for the Joyeaux unit and where?, How does the working carplay perform? From all the videos I‚Äôve seen it seems like it is lagging / slow / not smooth like the original interface? Hope you got the time to comment on that. One more thing I would do when doing that is swapping the hdd with an ssd for better performance of...pretty much everything pcm related, Hello  I seem to be having the same issue but no power to the carplay unit at all. did you need to remove the blue restrictor from the porsche harness to make contact with the oem harness.  I see in your video your touching it but Im not sure if you removed it. My fuse location is 12volts hot for sure but the carplay unit isn't showing a light of any sort. nothing indicating from the carplay unit on my screen. although my pcm is working like it did before the mod. Thank you, Glad to see this is relatively straightforward. I've done far more complex modifications to cars and other things over the years, and this is definitely one of the features that I need to have in my car - currently looking at a 2015 GTS - since having Wireless CarPlay in my daily has been so amazing, does this work on the panamera also?, Thanks for this video I followed step by step today and love the results in my 981 cayman \\nNote the joyeauto now comes with 6 T8 extension screws so you can screw down all three points of contact on the new motherboard‚Äîthey mush have seen your video!!, Awesome tutorial! Thanks for sharing! Do you have any idea, how much time it costed you to finish the installation?, Dude!!! I just installed mine.  Took an hour... super easy after watching the video.  The instructions and another video mentioned removing the fiber optic cable and plugging it directly into the unit.  I don‚Äôt know if you mentioned it.  I also plugged a lighting cable into the included usb cable and routed it behind the unit and have it exiting under the glove box and hid underneath the right side console trim and into the arm rear.  I also put the mic just above the steering wheel.   NO VISIBLE WIRES.  Thank you!, Could you please let me know what version of the PCM you have? I have the 3.40 version on my 991.1, and it seems there are very few solutions for that model., James, Your video gave me the confidence and inspiration to install a Carplay module in my Panamera Turbo.  I went with NM Automotive‚Äôs unit.  Nick Marquis, the principal, has been great to work with answering any questions.  I have since purchased another Porsche, 2012.5 991 2S, and will be tackling the Carplay on it next., Joyeauto support have just told me how to move the status bar from the left to right side: settings, CarPlay, password 1123 then the option to change to right hand drive is the top line, Curious how this is working after a year?  Any problems?  I've been looking at a unit by a company called zz-2 in the states for my 14 Cayenne.  Did you have to give up any functions of the PCM?, I am impressed. I replaced the head unit on a 997 and that drove me mad, so to see how you did this has inspired me to maybe do the same on my 991. Over in the UK for my 997 at least the connectors were different for a uk example to the euro style, so I am guessing you buy only from suppliers in your country to get it right. May sound obvious but over here in Europe it‚Äôs easy to get items shipped from the continent to maybe save on price., Again thank you so much for the video. Now that I have watched it entirely, I have a couple questions and depending on your answers will be buying the joy auto  1) You have had it a year now, are you happy with the joy auto unit? 2) You installed the unit under the steering column, but I didn't see you \"secure it\" in any way. Does it rattle? 3) Will any empty fuse port work? (You mentioned D1 early in the video) 4) You installed the microphone near the steering column. Does it pick up your voice well, particularly when you are driving and their is road noise?   THANK YOU, Hi Again.. Thanks for your replies.   At 10:43 you use a trim tool.  Where do I get one of those?, You are fearless.  Very inspiring.  I want to put a new head unit in my 997.1 but still don‚Äôt have the courage to try to wire it myself.  I also don‚Äôt want to pay $1,400 to have a shop do it.    Thanks for all the great content., what brand of backup camera seems to work best for the 991.1?, Have question on this regarding power. PCM stays on after you turn off the engine and PCM works for the next 20 minutes. Did you manage to install JoyAuto so that it remains powered like the PCM after you turn off the engine?, Super big thank you for this video. Very useful as many others on you channel! (up &amp; running on a 991.1) Congratulations for your job and attitude. Regards from Madrid üòâ Ivan, Dear friend, i m just buying a 991.1 , i am thinking to add this device to my car. Wanna ask that is it still working perfectly after almost a year?, Thanks so much for the videos, they are invaluable.  \\n\\nI have installed the Joyeauto system in my 991 and everything works great-- except the Joyeauto seems to reset every 4-5 minutes where the screen will go black for a split second and the audio stops.  Everything resumes working as before after about 1-2 more seconds.\\n\\nDo you know what might be causing this behavior?, Genius video! Thanks!, Thank you for this excellent video!  Quick question-- I added the mother board today and have the PCM back together awaiting reinstallation tomorrow.  What settings do I need to have the dip switches set on the Joyeauto box?  I am only adding CarPlay, no cameras at this time., This tutorial made this install fast and easy. I watched it twice before starting and was able to go through the entire process without having to stop. Thanks for a great and useful video. I do need to check that my fuse is switched, but other than that, all works fine. I even installed the backup camera at the same time. That added many more hours to the project. I have a Boxster, so Auto Amateur's video on this did not exactly help with the wire run, but they did help with the bumper removal which was less daunting that I had expected. Thanks!, 27:30 doesn‚Äôt the Cayenne already have a microphone for talking on the phone?  Why the second microphone?, I installed but the audio is not working !!, Great instruction vid. As I am to begin this task this weekend, may I ask if the PCM was coded (for disconnection of power)?, Thank you for this tutorial. I am ordering mine for my 2011 Cayenne S next week!, You seem to have infinite patience James. I lost it when I couldn‚Äôt gat the CD player to change discs on my 997 Turbo. üòÅ, Any recommendation on which fuse to utilize?  I‚Äôm tackling this tomorrow in my 991 Turbo S. Assuming (hopefully) I‚Äôll have the same fuse available that others have used., Excellent video!  Did you take precautions to ensure the box doesn't get crushed under the steering wheel if it is adjusted down?, Such an awesome video, thanks for taking the time and detail to do it right!  I installed this on my 2011 Cayenne S, and it is so great!  Absolutely, perfect and really updates the tired PCM-I don't look at my phone anymore while driving, too.  I wouldn't have trusted this product from China, and the detailed install, if not for this video.  I am amazed not a wire was needed to be stripped, spliced, or crimped.  Everything falls into place perfectly. This is even better than most factory installed CarPlay as it links wirelessly upon start up.  Ultimately, it is not as hard as it looks-it is worth it!\\n\\nA few notes/speedbumps from my install:\\n\\nMy problem was video would show after pressing NAVI, but no sound.¬†¬†\\n\\n1.This overall theory needs to be stressed: the sound from CarPlay module comes through the standard PCM AUX input, and you have to press that prior to the NAVI button, which activates CarPlay on the screen.  If you don't press AUX first, it will play whatever audio you are on, while showing CarPlay.  Just leave your source on AUX and your car will seamlessly go to CarPlay every time automatically on startup.¬† \\n\\nI had disabled and hid the AUX button, previously, since I never used this older technology, instead using AUX BT (which I now disable/hide in favor for the JoyeAuto CarPlay).¬† I could not find a way to unhide the AUX input and ultimately had to do a PCM reset, to have it show up again.¬† After performing this reset, it appears and you can then select it, and have sound and full functionality.\\n\\nPerform a PCM handover (also known as a PCM hard reset):\\nPress and hold the Info button for approximately 10 seconds until the PCM reboots.\\nImmediately select the following from the CAR&gt;&gt;OPTION&gt;&gt;Set PCM System&gt;&gt;Reset PCM&gt;&gt;Vehicle Handover&gt;&gt;Yes&gt;&gt;Yes\\nPress and hold the Info button for approximately 10 seconds until the PCM reboots.\\n\\n\\n2. JoyeAuto is now including 6 screw mounts (screw 2 together (x3) for a tall support) for the circuit board install, so it sits higher and perfectly above the existing boards.\\n3. Turn off AUX/BT and just commit to using CarPlay fully.  This reduces connectivity and calling issues, and just simplifies everything.  Bottom line, you won't need the old PCM interface anymore.\\n4. Fuse board spot for Cayenne, is on the left side of the driver side dashboard, where the dash faces the door.  Pop off this panel and plug in fuse into a vacant spot that turns on and off with the key in and out of the ignition.  \\n5. Make sure to read and follow comments/tips from Fastpitch Net, very helpful must read notes!\\n6. SAT still works as a source in case you ever want to go back and use Sirius XM like normal, however, there is a CarPlay app for that, so you can just stay there and use that instead.\\n7. Make sure to go into settings and have the microphone do an automatic adjustment.  My callers were getting echo when talking handsfree, and this setting auto adjustment instantly fixed it.\\n\\nFeel free to ask any questions!, You have a brave heart to do this alone, the warranty is gone, right?, I have looked and looked to find a video like this and I must thank you for your very detailed video. Although mine is Android+997.2, I don't think it would be much different. Still looking pretty daunting job to tackle on but at least now I know what it involves in. By the way you put the JoyeAuto unit under the steering column but I was wondering if you held it in place with anything such as ziptie, double sided tape and so on. The space looked like it's a pretty tight fit and the unit wouldn't come out of that spot easily but I wouldn't like it if it rattles when I drive only because I didn't hold it in place with some sort of fastening method. \\n2 constructive criticisms are that your background musics are very cheesy (I respect your taste though) that I am not sure if they suit to these type of Porsche videos and that you put reverse rolling /dissolving effects on the captions that show the first sentence the last. It makes the viewers not able to see the whole captions clearly. No intentions to insult you in any way but just my thoughts. Thank you very much again for your helpful videos., Thank you üòä  great work I ordered one to my 911.1 I hope everything go smoothly all the best üëç, Planning to retrofit the Macan PCM4.0, looking for the best retrofit kit.

Is that all., impressed very effective, No matter what, you have to use brushes and agitate ......, Good video BUT, why don't you \"articulate\" that wand from a \"below angle\" in order to hit the spokes at 11 to 2 O'clock which remained virtually un-touched by both the pre-solution AND the foam???  Drives me a bit crazy to see that, LOL!, My wheels werenever done until 215k km, they looked better than those here, Your finger bumps took the dust off lol, Hope to see a cleaner eventually that can be used without a foam machine.

Thanks, very hard to use, Can you just clay bar your car first and then apply this? Or should you clay, then polish and then apply this?, I just picked up my second bottle.

It looked so easy watching you applying it.  I am having a hard time using this.  Especially trying to wipe it off.    Don‚Äôt know if I am putting too much on the pad.  Is it better to leave it on longer till it‚Äôs dry?, chemical guys no like., Can it be used on the windshield? and other windows?, I charge $450 1 step polish then apply, Have you tried the soap version of this?, Thanks a bunch for this video. I just used this on my Maverick Lariat last week. I didn't do the prep though cuz I washed my truck and applied Nexgen's ceramic spray a week before I found Hydro slick. I love this stuff too Korey! I didn't have to use a lot of it either. My truck stays outdoors cuz I live in an apartment complex and a lot of dirt flies around my area. I just have to use a microfiber cloth to wipe of the dirt, dust, whatever, and it stays slick and shiny!! I sooo recommend this product to anyone who details their own vehicle!!, I love this stuff. It's kinda expensive but the ease of use and the amount you use, it's totally worth it. It hardly takes any product, goes on super easy and wipes off easy. Doesn't leave any kinda residue in the gaps or cracks or in emblems., I do a final rinse with no sprayer on the water hose.  99.9% of the water instantly sheets off that way and is all but dry., Sold!, Does this stuff clean as it goes on? Cause I cleaned my car 100% no grime at all and after few weeks I seen I had a bunch of swirl marks all over. I even used brand new towels on it.

New subscriber, Nice Quadro !! I've been using Meguiar's  Hybrid Ceramic on an M3 and E350. I want to try this product but I just purchased a new bottle of Meguiar's. Meguiar's is doing very well, but I apply a coat .... every day almost. Not that I need to; is just my obsession. WIth that said, I'll be up for Hydroslick in about 2 weeks ;) Nice vid.

Go pats, Is this only for use with cars that have a ceramic coating?, Do I need to clay bar the car first and then add ceramic coat? What about polish?, You think that's amazing beading? You need to try the Aussie made \"Bowden's - Happy Ending\"... I bought it a couple months ago, and honestly I cannot find anything that offers the same level of hydrophobic Protection. I actually had a few guys taking a video of my car in the rain in a car park the other day, only because they were so amazed at how the rain literally rolled straight off the car, like a waterfall. Amazing stuff... Chemical Guys are brilliant, but this \"Happy Ending\" stuff is the ducks nuts!!!!, I bought some and it smells like spoiled garbage? Anyone else smell like this?, I love your wax videos, could you try some BILT hamber products? They‚Äôre really good performers at amazing prices. The double speed wax is famous in the UK for its amazing hydrophobics and it‚Äôs low cost of ¬£15. The auto-foam and auto-wash are also great products, really good cleaning power, I did my first A-Z exterior detail from wash to hydro slick my car, I did notice it dried quickly inside my garage (slightly warm) which gave me a slight hassle‚Ä¶ would you throw some canuba wax over it as an extra layer? I use chemical guys butter wet wax in general, Brought this stuff I don't need to do  preparation on my car as I done it a month ago so I won't need to clay or polish as it's a new car üôÉ, You got an update?, You are awesome. Love the Giulia, The \"slick\" feel comes from a silicone., I‚Äôve just came across this review video after buying a bottle of this, yes I know I should have done things the other way around but nevertheless thank you very much for a honest opinion and a proper review of this. My car is brand new and in black so I‚Äôm desperate to get this applied now after seeing your video! Subscribed just after the first video üëåüèª, You shoul use hydro charge before acording to producent to get best, Wow!  This is the most thorough review I‚Äôve ever seen on a wax.  Awesome video.

Do you have to have your vehicle vehicle coated to use this product?, Can you use a machine with this product? Or is it meant to be applied by hand?, What do you do to prep the car? Could you guide me ü•≤, would you say this is better than their butter wax? i want a easy to use liquid wax to apply after sealent so i was going to go for Butter Wax but your review of this seems good and basically the same application and results, What tire shine you use, Chemical Guys is a joke. They have good products, however their customer service is literally non existent, by phone, email, or website. They don‚Äôt care. You have a problem with your shipment or product, you are on your own and out of the money you spent. I will never do business with Chemical Guys again. The Better Business Bureau has numerous complaints filed against Chemical Guys for this exact issue. Do business with them at your own risk., Chemical Guys hyper slick. very easy to use.  Last 2x  longer than Meguiar's Ultimate wax., I put this on one of my fleet vehicles that frequently travel 40 miles a week on a desert washboard road. Since using this product I have never needed nothing more than water to wash the dust off including the windows. Have since applied to a fleet of 15 Lincoln hybrids. The drivers told me they've seen more tips since!, I just purchased a brand new car. I am wondering if I can use that product on my car in order to see it shine?, Getting this in a couple of days, If this works on my RC cars I‚Äôll try it on my car, wow that looks sick!, What's the difference between HydroSlick and JetSeal ? I am kind of confused, Can you use this with the CG Blacklight? Would the HydroSlick be used after the blacklight to seal?, What are you using in the spray bottle to decontaminate the surface?  You said it so quick I couldn't make it out., That's like impossible to do in places like all of fl and Seattle cuz it rains all the damn time.ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, i love mine no issues,, LOL send me your fusso coat.. i need that :P, Great demo, thank you for showing us a great product., This vs 007 Gloss Enhancer?, OUTSTANDING COMMENTARY. THANK YOU !!!!!, I ran out of F11 top coat and started using Silk Shine dressing because it had uV protection etc, I wrote chemical guys to ask if the slick an upgrade to the silk and he was like no they‚Äôre two different products, unaware like wow! I say all this because I have been using the SILK and it washes off dirt with ease like nothing before , I wrote the chemical guys guy back with what I was using on my whole car (yellow corvette) windows also and he stopped replying üòÇ did I just find out their new product formula???, I got it from autozone for $50.. :(.. the trick of it is to apply a thin layer., thick layer reacts as a coagulation and it just peel off of the surface, and I believe doesn‚Äôt do his job when that happens,, ( just my opinion)., I'm a novice with wax and ceramic coating. I have a black Infiniti Q50 do you have any advice about washing, waxing and ceramic coating. Im worried about swirl marks and scratches., Watched a bunch of your reviews.

Saw it at WalMart today and I was surprised!, What tire dressing do you use man? Very nice!, how does it hold up compared to something like Nufinish?, Stuff works great first applied but after 2 washes or so bottom panels have no sheeting or anything. At least in my experience and real world driving ( south florida) won't last a month, alot of better alternatives out there for half the price., Chemical Guys make great products but they're highly overpriced., Just finished restoration on my 1991 F150, used Sikkens paint so it had a pretty deep shine to start with. I've used Chemical Guys V07 Spray Sealant on it with great results (LOVE it). So I wanted something to put on the paint that would withstand the truck sitting outside in the elements (put my wife's car back in the garage, Lol). So I applied the HYDRO-SLICK (easy on, moderately easy to take off). The DEPTH of shine is absolutely off the charts, I've never used anything that has as CRISP & BRILLIANT shine as Hydro-Slick, I am completely amazed. Now I just put it on 2 days ago, so time will tell as far as durability, but in my opinion the shine itself is well worth the $ price $ of this product. I really like Chemical Guys products & no I don't get anything for this review besides a PHENOMENAL shine!!! Hope this review helps anyone considering,  you won't be disappointed., Doesnt work for long. And they advertise 12months lmao, I strongly recommend Dri wash n guard, Just tried it. Excellent product, I noticed you didn't use your GT350R. Do you think this Hydro Slick would be harmful to apply over the stripes?, Junk, $40 a bottle one wash and gone.

Then I saw you have a QV!, Question. This only if car coated or is okay to use if after claying?, You think you can just use this by itself? Thinking of getting this for my black ram but applying like 2-3 coats on it. Not sure how I‚Äôll know when to put a new coat on. And when that happens will I have to strip the paint clean just to put on a new coat?, I bought one bottle of this. First time using it and I really like it. Smells like a candle with candy üòÇüòÇ\\n\\nI bought it for 20$ Only!!, So would this be a good addition to the layer over the turtle wax ceramic coating spray? Or is that overkill?, I'm wanting to see the product in action before I shell out $40 for it., I just used it on a black 1997 ford mustard but I should have used panel wipe before applying. I will find out! but I hope it holds up i did compound and polish the paint so it should be okay, can you buy it in Canada anywhere.., I normally like to stay away from chemical guys products but I may have to give this a shot, ...]   \n",

more car and less face? No offense., Hips on the 997 üòç, 4 years later the tables have turned. More and more I hear people actually prefer the 996.1 over the 996.2 or 997., I‚Äôve a 996 now which I love, I‚Äôve had a 997 which again was great, I prefer the 996 interior as it‚Äôs less German than the 997, regarding the headlights I love them both, what‚Äôs not to like they are 911‚Äôs !!, I like the 996 styling better all around... but I guess that's why I own one. lol., It‚Äôs a joke how expensive the 996 is in Australia., Just saw this vid. I recently purchased a 987.1 Boxster, Black Metallic, Sand Beige interior. I had a '00 986 Boxster previously. I concur with a lot of your findings, the 997/987 is a better car, more refined. I'm enjoying my 987.1 Boxster here in the Brainerd Lakes area, Central MN. It gets a lot of looks and comments, as it's a rare car here. Enjoying your vids., great zeds dead at the start, Interesting attempt to compare but sounds more like another ‚Äúlet‚Äôs beat up on the 996‚Äù review., There is no 933. üò¨, 996 is a pain in the eyes ü§™, Still liking your 997, James.  :)  But glad you are enjoying your 991.  I need to drive my 997.1 Turbo more., Really surprised you didn‚Äôt even mention one of the biggest interior difference, which is the center console. Do you prefer the way that looks over the 996? I do, big time. The 996 interior looks almost Japanese to me and hasn‚Äôt aged nearly as well., Ha ha ha ha you mean Volkswagen bug eyes that‚Äôs what a lot of people call in the street 997 also known as Herbie eyes, I still remember back in 1999, when I got to be a passenger in a 996.  It was at night, I was amazed how well the headlights WORKED, remember for 1999 they were very advanced., You buy a Porsche then you get the boring one twice are u really happy? Let me ask u this if I offered u half a slice of ur favrout cake or a loaf of dry bread? U do see what I mean right but hey I love Porsche that's why I might be seeing it like so I mean the least a turbo, That was cruel,  my dog thinks he‚Äôs kinda cute!, Someone should have done an affordable / cool, conversion kit for the 996, to update the headlights.  Would have sold well for sure., The bumperettes are only there due to the narrower USA license plate. Same with the 928. Personally I love them!, I need some aspirin after listening to that music., Why are you opposed to the Gundo hack?, Gundo hack all the way! The interior colour of your car hasn't aged well imo. Good vid., I currently own both a 03‚Äô 996.2 and an 08‚Äô 997.1.  996.2 definitely looks and feels more vintage even though it‚Äôs only 5 years younger.  The 997.1 more modern on outside and inside.  The driving on 996.2 is more fun on the lower gears.  It has that Porsche sound when you accelerate.  While the 997.1 runs more steady and solid without the howling of the 996.2.  I bought the 997.1 first as my DD then I wanted a lower priced 911 to alternate as DD so I went with a high mileage 996.2.  Overall, if I had to pick one, I would choose the 997.1 BUT I would easily miss the 996.2 howl acceleration sound.  That sound is pure Porsche music., You said ‚Äúum‚Äù thousands of times, The bumperettes are to be in compliance with the American 5mph bumper laws., You don't see the headlights when you are driving :), The 996 is unique in styling among 911's and feel that in itself will make it a future classic (especially 4S's, Turbo's and GT's) as no other 911 looks quite like it, the 997 is a handsome car but the interior feels a bit square and more built for the production line since the vw takeover and the rear end of the car I feel looks worse than its predecessor. I guess in the future the 997 will feel like and older cheaper 991 while the 996 feels like a completely different car in its own right, not better not worse just unique and will have its own fans., i like the garage floors... any idea?, I prefer the gen 1 996 headlights to the gen 2. Maybe I‚Äôm crazy, or maybe it‚Äôs because i fell in love with Porsche with the original 996., I prefer the first gen 996 over the 997. The 1999 996 to me is the perfect 911. It had the perfect blend of the old world and the new, with just enough technology to keep you safe but not so much to drive you nuts. Pinky Lai designed the 996 and he knew what he was doing. The 996 has a cleaner, leaner body style and a nicely laid out simple interior with no gimmicky buttons all over the place., i like everything about the 997 but the interior and steering wheel. 2003 996 C2 here in all Black., Just a note on the slim vs fat ass design. The original 911 was a slim ass design. Much more so than the base 996. But the wide ass RS and Turbo models are the iconic ones, aren't they?, Big difference in the steering wheel is that the 996 wheel did not tilt; the 997 wheel does.  Huge if you're over 6'.  Also, where did you get the PORSCHE lettering on the rear lid?  That's not stock as far as I know but I like it., You said you‚Äôre a big guy. How tall exactly? I‚Äôm about 6‚Äô5‚Äù but slim and thinking about a 996 or 997 and am wondering what chance I have to fit in one comfortably, FYI the bumper adds are not for the smaller licence plates, it's because of different crash requirements US vs. Europe. That's why., As a current 1999 996 owner, I crave a 80's air cooled 911 over a 996 and 997 any day., after I had an F Modell, a G Model and a 964 ¬†(all second hand) I bought a brand new 996 Carrera 2 in 2003 that I still own. It is the most reliable 911 I ever had. Stil a pure pleasure to drive and it looks and feels like brand new. I like the 991 but I feel disgusted about the \"tuned engine sond\" like many new cars have. It just doesn`t sound true..., 996 look great when they are dropped with a set of coilovers. Overall the design works better with the lower nose and lower rear hip line than on 997. Just my opinion..., I have the memory seats on my 987 boxster...but no sports chrono.  Maybe a difference in package between 911 and boxster?, Nice piece. But you make a big deal about the 'bumperettes'. Let me tell you from first hand experience, my good man, that you most certainly WANT those bumperettes. I was at a stop sign, moved a few inches ahead to see traffic, and had the person behind me thinking that I was going for the opening. WHAM! Bumped me so hard that I could not believe it that there was no damage, so much so that I took the car to have it looked at by my mechanic who was happy to report that I had dodged a bullet. No damage. Now I was lucky that the bumpers happened to line up, otherwise this minor traffic incident would have turned into something ugly. Thank Zuffenhausen for those bumperettes. And take pity upun the 991 owners, who will be crying into their beer over even a 4 mph bump. Cheers., The headlights on the 997 are nothing like the \"iconic original 911 lights\" - they are a modern equivalent - they slope back and not sit up like originals so look very different to me. I think the front  of the 996.2 is more sporty and aerodynamic and i prefer the lights to the 997's- like you say unique and will never be copied again = a one of!!  Also the 996 still looks slim/sporty/sleek unlike the 997 which is starting to look BIG a big butt!!!  and the 991 - please= huge., It's the 996 for me all day long and especially in seal grey. And on the plus side, they're much cheaper., The 996 headlights were good enough for the 996 GT1 LeMans and street version car. Only the amber blinker versions looked bad, the litronic and clear versions were cool., I am biased because I have an 02 996, but I really like the lights as well.  They really don't bother me.  Cheers on a great video., Quick comment on the seat memory. I too am the only one that drives my vehicle but every time I take my car in for service it never fails, the seat is moved. I tell them don't get comfortable because they are not moving in but they always succeed in moving my seat. Same happens when the carwash service comes around, they are only driving to the back of the parking lot, 100 yards at the most... As I always tell my wife, don't mess with my switches!\\n\\nNice video btw!, Just to let you know, i have Fabspeed exhaust and intake in my 997 Carrara Cabrio and it's AMAZING! But to be honest all you need is the intake.  It makes an amazing sound above 5000rpm that i believe will leave you smiling from ear to ear...   Keep those excellent videos coming..., Is that ribtrax on the floor?, Good comparison with a thorough explanation of the differences.  I spent the morning at the local dealer looking at a 997.2, C4S I spotted at the rear of the dealers service lot.  it had a sign on the dash saying, \"Not For Sale, Smog and Safety service required.\"  The sales guys said I could buy it although it was taken in on trade just yesterday, and the exterior is still dirty.  And it obviously still needs to be serviced.  The interior is in very nice condition, and clean.  Anyway, I'll probably go back tomorrow morning and put a deposit on it,  since I'm sure it'll sell before it gets out to the front of the dealers lot.   Wish me luck!\\nLooking forward to your on road comparison!, Nice! Anything you prefer about the 996, or 997 better all round?]   \n",
       "4  [Excellent tutorial video. Congrats! Maybe two things you could emphasize also: a) don't forget to replug the fiber cable (if you have any) from the original to the Joyeauto harness and b) definitely look for a fuse socket that switches with the ignition if you don't want to ruin your car battery. :-), Do you find the box beneath the steering column interferes with moving the steering wheel?, No offense to your excellent video, but this one is the best I have seen - though it is for a different product, which admittedly has fewer parts to it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwnwfwTsFTQ, Does anyone know someone in the Dallas area that I could pay to complete this install??, Just want to echo George P's thought below. Got my JoyeAuto unit a couple weeks ago and got around to installing it today. This video was fantastic, took me maybe 3 hours and I was going slow. Perfect on the first try, except I initially didn't have sound until I realized I needed to set the input to AUX. LOL.\\n\\nThank you so much for making this great tutorial!\\n\\nEDIT--one lesson learned was that I decided to re-mount the JoyeAuto processing box in the upper left area of the footwell just beyond the fuse box. I found that the wires were getting caught in the, I don't know what to call it--the pivot point of the steering column. This way it's completely out of the way of the steering column., Hi there, I have been using the JoyeAuto unit for about a year and wanted to provide some feedback and tips I learned in the process.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have the following configuration:\\r\\n\\r\\n2015 base 911 carrera US\\r\\n7 speed\\r\\nBose system\\r\\nNo cameras\\r\\nPixel 6 Pro phone using android auto wireless\\r\\n\\r\\nIssues:\\r\\n\\r\\nPower.  If you want the unit to stay powered up after the car turns off, then you can't use the normal switched power options available in the driver side fuse box.  Alternatively, if you use the fulltime powered fuse locations, the unit stays on 100% of the time which creates other problems (battery drain and the phone may stay connected depending on car location vs. phone).  The solution is to use a particular fuse location in the passenger side (right) footwell:  D9.  This means running a longer length of wire if you have the JoyeAuto box in the driver's (left hand) side, but well worth having the best of both worlds.  Once in place, the unit will power up as soon as the car is unlocked and power down about 20-30 minutes after the key is pulled from the ignition.\\r\\nI'm surprised this isn't mentioned by more people but maybe they just live with the loss of power when the engine is turned off when using the left hand fuse box options.  Or maybe there's some other factor at play I missed.  Please comment if you have a different experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoot flakiness.  The normal boot sequence when getting in the car is to hit the Navi button to engage the JoyeAuto system.  It then auto detects the previous Android Auto connection and displays it on the screen to be selected.  On some occasions the phone doesn't show up to be selected but it was still found by JoyeAuto (I don't know if this is a timeout issue or something else) which is evident from the Android button being highlighted in purple.  In this case, you have to go into the setup menu, choose the bottom left most option (Smart Phone), Wireless AA, and the phone is in the list to be selected for boot.  I have tried to skip all this and simply select the purple Android button but then it gets hung up requiring me to fiddle with my phone (usually going airplane mode and back restores things).  Since the unit stays on even with power off, you'd have to resort to more manual power off options like accessing the JoyeAuto unit or the fuse box, neither option of which is pretty.  Lesson there is not to attempt booting without actually selecting the connected phone.  The little green \"link\" icon can also cause this problem if the phone hasn't been selected already.\\r\\nIf someone can improve upon this experience please share.\\r\\n\\r\\nBT connection and Mic issues.  The provided Mic is weak and will create sound quality issues for phone calls.  Adjusting it to help phone calls can have a detrimental effect on Hey Google.  The workaround, which others have also mentioned, is to use the built-in car PCM for phone calls.  That means the phone will have two simultaneous connections when in the car:  JoyeAuto and PCM.  The trick is to use the latter for phone calls which isn't always the default (I'm not sure how android prioritizes and/or saves them).  And you can't disable or forget JoyeAuto from the phone because Android Auto seems to reinstate it, if only partially (forgetting should wipe it out but it sticks around zombie like).  For a time, I was dynamically entering the IDCore setup menu and disabling BT from there which worked, but I'd have to re-establish the BT connection manually (like start of day) on car start each time which sucked.  I since learned Android offers an option to select which BT connection is active for a call in the BT menu.  But that only presents itself during the call, so if you think the JoyeAuto BT connection is active you have to quickly go into the phone menu and select PCM as the \"active connection\".  The Android Auto touch screen has the option to select the speakerphone during the call which might prove helpful as a quick save while fiddling on the phone...\\r\\nThe good news is I don't find myself doing this very often, so the phone seems to try to re-use the last connection if it's there.  If anyone has a more reliable way to keep PCM as the primary phone connection let us know.\\r\\n\\r\\nSound quality.  There's been a lot of discussion on this topic and of course it's difficult to describe other than maybe poor sound, tinny, distorted, etc.  And this all depends on the type of music being played.  Some tips here include the use of the JoyeAuto EQ menu dynamically (while the music is being played).  You can actually start playing music and exit the AA screen (select IDCore or Exit from the list of programs) which gets you back to the boot menu where Setup can be chosen.  From there just go into the EQ menu, choose the settings icon to \"tab over\" into the EQ screen and select accordingly (while the music is playing).  This should help tune the system more quickly by going in and out of the AA screen to choose different music and coming back into EQ settings.  Note, that little green link icon is now your friend to get you back into the main AA screen.  \\r\\nPersonally, I got bass distortion when enabling the loudness option and also had to lower the 60/150hz settings but maybe that's my music again, or just taste.  I have attached pictures with my settings fwiw.  YMMV, but I would like to hear back from others on their precise EQ settings (including loudness/subwoofer) just the same.  There may be something optimal out there.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuilt-in Mic.  Once PCM is setup for phone calls, the Mic settings can be optimized around clearly picking up voice command instructions (vs. compromising for echo, etc.).  A higher sensitivity level works better but I must say it's still not great in my car.  A speed with the background road noise the voice command is garbled and I get poor results.  This could be that my tires are louder and need replacing or Mic placement (perpendicular off the steering column just out of eye level sight) so again YMMV.  \\r\\nIf anyone has any tips to share here, let us know.\\r\\n\\r\\nSummary.\\r\\nOverall, I am personally very happy with the value the JoyeAuto system provides but I must admit I would not be able to recommend this to people who are not tech savvy since it requires a bit of know-how to workaround the flakiness when it presents (which is about 15% of the time).  The workarounds are not onerous, but to somebody who expects things to just work, it's a deal killer.  If we can improve on my experiences above maybe the system can get more stable and be fit for the masses., Thanks for the great tutorial James! I'm thinking of buying the kit and install it myself, is this kit something you would still recommend? Or would you suggest looking at other options?, Your video was truly helpful! Thank you.\\nHowever, after installation, this module has discharged two batteries already (one - I thought it was old, two - I realized it was the radio). Do you know if I have done something wrong? I'm thinking on returning it back now...\\nThanks!!, My favorite part was where you spread the wiring harnesses out on the workbench to make the wiring diagram come to life. Excellent!, Wow - this is one of the best DIY vids I've seen! I don't know if you've discouraged me or encouraged me!  \\nüëç How did you end up securing the unit under the dash. Also, what is the purpose of the USB Cable?, I just wanted to say a MASSIVE THANK YOU and SERIOUSLY WELL DONE for taking the time and effort to produce this video!! You are a HERO!! Having watched this I was able to complete my install in a little over 2hrs and without a need to even consult the very minimalistic and poorly worded instructions / diagram that it came with. As another commenter has suggested, the only thing to add would be that of ensuring to pick an appropriate Fuse Port for the power. I initially used one in Row A which I then realised was continuous power (for the alarm, immobiliser etc) and would not only draw unnecessarily on the battery when parked, but also meant that the WiFi on the JoyeAuto wasn't working and I couldn't get it to pair with my phone as a result (maybe a low voltage issue...?? not sure). Anyway, I then moved it to a free Fuse Port in Row C and it worked straight away and only now has power on ignition as well. Lastly I cut my hands to bits and sweated hard over about 45 mins to feed the USB cable around the back of (and into) the glovebox...not fun at all but sits neatly out of the way in there now (personal preference). I also cable-tied / zip-tied the excess cable lengths together and then tied these up behind the steering dash...I did the same with the JoyeAuto control box too...just keeps them neatly out of sight and avoids any risk of them slipping / dropping down into the footwell and fouling the pedals while you're driving (that wouldn't be ideal!!). Anyway...back to my original reason for commenting...thank you so much, you've been an absolute saviour with this video!!, Thank you for the DIY. After watching your videos I went and purchased the Joyeauto for my 981 Cayman. Question, does your interface box stay on after you turn off the car. My head unit turned off automatically when I turned off the car but the interface box with the blue light stayed on. Just wondering if it is supposed to be that way or if I have a bad unit. Any help would be greatly appreciated., I am getting some screen flickering when the environment is dim and the screen tries to auto adjust the brightness, are you getting this issue?, Nice tounge...yikes, Hi there\\n\\nI have tried to fit this to my 991.1 targa , but i have hit a problem !\\nThe head unit switches off with an alert from the dash saying SWITCHES DEACTIVATED. So after maybe ten attempts to start the head unit its now not working .\\nI noticed that i have 2 small pins in the head unit that the Joyeauto harness hasn‚Äôt and the original harness has a blue flashing light that matches into the head unit.\\n\\nAny ideas going forward, One small update I'd like is to have the ability to autostart androidauto when it recognizes it. It bugs me that I have to click into it every time or else it won't boot-up into AndroidAuto. Does anyone have any tips?, Update: Local car stereo shop quoted me 4 to 6 hours to install the rear camera option on the Joy Auto mod at $150 per hour. So I studied several more videos and stuck my borescope camera into various nooks and crannies. I decided I could do it for less t6han $600. Took off the bumper and ran my wires around the RIGHT side of the car went behind the taillight. and into the rubber seals being careful to keep the wires clear of convertible top guillotines. then i tested the camera and Oh Joy! it works great. even hast the little car silhouette when you get close to an immoveable object. Went to my local market to get some essential items (butter and Glenlivet) and when I got back to the car I noticed the rear windows were still down with the top up. I hadn't noticed when i parked and put the top up, but the front windows didn't come up when the top reached full lock but came up with the switches. So happy with Carplay mod and rear camera but cant live with back windows down. What did I do wrong.BTW, I am going to stow the JA box to the passenger side beneath the kick panel were you access the cabin air filter., Just ran into two hitches. First the good news: kit now ships with double standoffs to get the board up higher. the bad news, they appear to have changed the Sirius antenna connector and nit now is still too high. So, I temp pulled the Sirius board. Secondly, I am having a very hard time getting the fiber optic (Bose) out of the original connector. I dont want to mess them up because replacement would be hell.  how did you or anybody get them out>, Por Sha, Hi, i have just installed the Joyeauto to my cayenne following your video. Thanx a lot. ƒ∞ just wonder that the HDMI port is working or not?, It has terrible sound quality via AUX., The main unit is nice & compact compared to the MMI & AMI boxes used in other car makes., Pat, nice work.  Would you be willing to do an install for me?  How can I contact you?, hallo is it possible to install blothoch back camera ?, Thank you Mate! you just made my day, I'm picking up a 2015 911 on Monday and this is the 1st mod I'm going to do!, Just ordered the joyeauto kit for my 2014 991 Turbo S and I'm excited to do this project.  Your video  very much lessens the fear and reluctance to dive into the project.  Excellent video!, Great installation video. I‚Äôm tempted to do this soon., My 2016 Cayman came with a rearview camera, but I can't get it to work with the JoyeAuto CarPlay no matter what settings are on the box.  With one setting it comes on in Drive, but I can't get it to work when in reverse.  Any suggestions?, Does anyone else have a BT skipping problem with their iPhone? Will this addition fix that BT problem?, Great guide. One question, does this disable the pcm maps on the head unit or the dial display?, great Video. I had to reconfigure the switches on the external gadget and everything works well and connects with any iPhone. the only issue I'm facing now is connecting it to my android. Nothing I did worked till now. Any tips out there to help me fix this problem??, I think I've drained my battery not putting in the right place. Can you please tell me which port it needs to go into, If you can, I can‚Ä¶. Thanks for the confidence, I've followed your video but my sound not working at all, Thanks for this.  So how is the joyeauto performing so far?  Any issues?, Great video! Very informative ü§ôüèΩ, BEST VIDEO IN THE WORLD \\nMORE VIDEOS PLEASE MASTER CARPLAY HHH\\nGOOD MAN, Not going to like this as you have exactly 911 likes hahahaha, This video was so helpful during my install. Huge, this is the best apple car play video. in his 6 month review he also notes that if you have the Bose system you have to unplug the optic cables from the Porsche Harness and put then into the Joyeauto harness because this type of cable can't be extended. Real pain. It took my friend and I forever to figure out why we weren't getting audio. Joyeauto now includes 2 sets of extenders so people with the XM Radio can secure it properly.  Another tip: get some felt tape to put between the XM board and the Joyeauto board that goes in the PCM., I just installed the JoyeAuto in my 991.1 yesterday. I couldn‚Äôt have done it without your great videos. My only snafu was removing the orange Bose wiring and then mistakenly reinstalling it in the same place. I do have one question. You mentioned secured the box with zip-ties. Do you have any suggested in this regard?, Just completed the install in my 2014 911.  Thank you for the tutorial. It only took me about 1 hr to complete thanks to your great video and tips., Cheers for Video bro made fitting mine a-lot easer .long story short i watched your vid 2 or 3 times then attempted doing mine the 1st time i fitted it all worked ok but the green and red and blue looked abit washed out ie faded .so i thought ahh that something to do with RGB to the screen .any way next weekend i removed it and took it all apart and re did all the flat ribbon cables and made shure the video out plug on the new daughter board was fully seated .Stuck it all back together refitted back in the car .this time no car play at all  ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø again removed the whole unit undid the PCM unit checked all the ribbons again stuck it back together then fitted it for the 3rd time lol .it worked perfectly all the vibrant colors as it should been the 1st time even thought it was a right pain the ++++ it was still worth doing ohh and i removed the PCM harddrive that located on the top of the unit cloned that with a SSD hard drive and put the original in a safe place  ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø cheers again bud, Excellent video, I'm just working through this and it worked first time. The only issue I have is getting the PCM unit back in to the dash, the extra wiring is stopping it going all the way in. Any tips on this?, Just purchased my Mine can‚Äôt wait to install, Does the audio quality suffer w/ CarPlay vs the PCM radio?, Hello, thanks for the video, I have one question, after the installation, do you still have the map on the dashboard gages ? Thanks, Hilarious, what a great tutorial and video!  Much appreciated. Very suave accent too., Hi James. great video! i have one install in my wife Macan and everything works really well except when she calls from her car the receiver of call hears and echo of their voice coming back to them.\\nJust wondering if you have any suggestions please?, Could u also add a backup camera?, Is anyone having issues due to the burmester sound system with this apple CarPlay, Definitely looking into this. I want car play for my Macan so bad, Any links to some good porsche forums?, Very impressive tutorial! Am surprised the OEM Porsche head unit is able to be disassembled; I would‚Äôve thought it would be a single monolithic unit., I nick, Thanks for the tuto, very easy to install.\\nJust a question, After about 48hours, my battery is done, the joyeauto stay on After I turn off the car, Thanks for your answere and sorry for my bad english., I just bought one and the screen doesn‚Äôt turns on but it has sound, so you know why does that happen and do you know how to fix it?, off to tackle my install tomorrow on my boxster.   watched the video several times o i hope im ready.  great video, Great video mate, attempting this one my gt4.\\nHave you got a scouse twang to your accent ??, I don‚Äôt have a GPS on my Macan s , will I still works?, will the factory installed back up camera continue to work after the installation?, This is fantastic post. Thank you., Hi all\\nAnyone have experienced loosing back up camera after installing this CarPlay. It was good for few weeks but if I drive the car more than 20 minutes then I loose back up camera. I read the Joyauto CarPlay get too hot and this causes some malfunctioning. And solution?\\nThanks, Excellent vid ü•Ç very informative. Does this system work with the Kayenne, it‚Äôs 2012 with Bose.  Thanks in advance üëç, I installed everything correctly but my screen is not powering on at all.    I tried my original harness and it works so the ribbons are connected properly. Just not drawing juice from the joyeauto harness, Is there a solution like this for my 2008 997.1?, Exceptional video.. About to collect a 2016 Cayman GTS and hope to do the same; whether I do it get it done, let's see but you've done an amazing, well presented and instructional video. Thank you\\nJust have to add that if ANYONE has done this to their 981 Cayman or Boxster, how well did it go and was there space for the Joyeaux unit and where?, How does the working carplay perform? From all the videos I‚Äôve seen it seems like it is lagging / slow / not smooth like the original interface? Hope you got the time to comment on that. One more thing I would do when doing that is swapping the hdd with an ssd for better performance of...pretty much everything pcm related, Hello  I seem to be having the same issue but no power to the carplay unit at all. did you need to remove the blue restrictor from the porsche harness to make contact with the oem harness.  I see in your video your touching it but Im not sure if you removed it. My fuse location is 12volts hot for sure but the carplay unit isn't showing a light of any sort. nothing indicating from the carplay unit on my screen. although my pcm is working like it did before the mod. Thank you, Glad to see this is relatively straightforward. I've done far more complex modifications to cars and other things over the years, and this is definitely one of the features that I need to have in my car - currently looking at a 2015 GTS - since having Wireless CarPlay in my daily has been so amazing, does this work on the panamera also?, Thanks for this video I followed step by step today and love the results in my 981 cayman \\nNote the joyeauto now comes with 6 T8 extension screws so you can screw down all three points of contact on the new motherboard‚Äîthey mush have seen your video!!, Awesome tutorial! Thanks for sharing! Do you have any idea, how much time it costed you to finish the installation?, Dude!!! I just installed mine.  Took an hour... super easy after watching the video.  The instructions and another video mentioned removing the fiber optic cable and plugging it directly into the unit.  I don‚Äôt know if you mentioned it.  I also plugged a lighting cable into the included usb cable and routed it behind the unit and have it exiting under the glove box and hid underneath the right side console trim and into the arm rear.  I also put the mic just above the steering wheel.   NO VISIBLE WIRES.  Thank you!, Could you please let me know what version of the PCM you have? I have the 3.40 version on my 991.1, and it seems there are very few solutions for that model., James, Your video gave me the confidence and inspiration to install a Carplay module in my Panamera Turbo.  I went with NM Automotive‚Äôs unit.  Nick Marquis, the principal, has been great to work with answering any questions.  I have since purchased another Porsche, 2012.5 991 2S, and will be tackling the Carplay on it next., Joyeauto support have just told me how to move the status bar from the left to right side: settings, CarPlay, password 1123 then the option to change to right hand drive is the top line, Curious how this is working after a year?  Any problems?  I've been looking at a unit by a company called zz-2 in the states for my 14 Cayenne.  Did you have to give up any functions of the PCM?, I am impressed. I replaced the head unit on a 997 and that drove me mad, so to see how you did this has inspired me to maybe do the same on my 991. Over in the UK for my 997 at least the connectors were different for a uk example to the euro style, so I am guessing you buy only from suppliers in your country to get it right. May sound obvious but over here in Europe it‚Äôs easy to get items shipped from the continent to maybe save on price., Again thank you so much for the video. Now that I have watched it entirely, I have a couple questions and depending on your answers will be buying the joy auto  1) You have had it a year now, are you happy with the joy auto unit? 2) You installed the unit under the steering column, but I didn't see you \"secure it\" in any way. Does it rattle? 3) Will any empty fuse port work? (You mentioned D1 early in the video) 4) You installed the microphone near the steering column. Does it pick up your voice well, particularly when you are driving and their is road noise?   THANK YOU, Hi Again.. Thanks for your replies.   At 10:43 you use a trim tool.  Where do I get one of those?, You are fearless.  Very inspiring.  I want to put a new head unit in my 997.1 but still don‚Äôt have the courage to try to wire it myself.  I also don‚Äôt want to pay $1,400 to have a shop do it.    Thanks for all the great content., what brand of backup camera seems to work best for the 991.1?, Have question on this regarding power. PCM stays on after you turn off the engine and PCM works for the next 20 minutes. Did you manage to install JoyAuto so that it remains powered like the PCM after you turn off the engine?, Super big thank you for this video. Very useful as many others on you channel! (up & running on a 991.1) Congratulations for your job and attitude. Regards from Madrid üòâ Ivan, Dear friend, i m just buying a 991.1 , i am thinking to add this device to my car. Wanna ask that is it still working perfectly after almost a year?, Thanks so much for the videos, they are invaluable.  \\n\\nI have installed the Joyeauto system in my 991 and everything works great-- except the Joyeauto seems to reset every 4-5 minutes where the screen will go black for a split second and the audio stops.  Everything resumes working as before after about 1-2 more seconds.\\n\\nDo you know what might be causing this behavior?, Genius video! Thanks!, Thank you for this excellent video!  Quick question-- I added the mother board today and have the PCM back together awaiting reinstallation tomorrow.  What settings do I need to have the dip switches set on the Joyeauto box?  I am only adding CarPlay, no cameras at this time., This tutorial made this install fast and easy. I watched it twice before starting and was able to go through the entire process without having to stop. Thanks for a great and useful video. I do need to check that my fuse is switched, but other than that, all works fine. I even installed the backup camera at the same time. That added many more hours to the project. I have a Boxster, so Auto Amateur's video on this did not exactly help with the wire run, but they did help with the bumper removal which was less daunting that I had expected. Thanks!, 27:30 doesn‚Äôt the Cayenne already have a microphone for talking on the phone?  Why the second microphone?, I installed but the audio is not working !!, Great instruction vid. As I am to begin this task this weekend, may I ask if the PCM was coded (for disconnection of power)?, Thank you for this tutorial. I am ordering mine for my 2011 Cayenne S next week!, You seem to have infinite patience James. I lost it when I couldn‚Äôt gat the CD player to change discs on my 997 Turbo. üòÅ, Any recommendation on which fuse to utilize?  I‚Äôm tackling this tomorrow in my 991 Turbo S. Assuming (hopefully) I‚Äôll have the same fuse available that others have used., Excellent video!  Did you take precautions to ensure the box doesn't get crushed under the steering wheel if it is adjusted down?, Such an awesome video, thanks for taking the time and detail to do it right!  I installed this on my 2011 Cayenne S, and it is so great!  Absolutely, perfect and really updates the tired PCM-I don't look at my phone anymore while driving, too.  I wouldn't have trusted this product from China, and the detailed install, if not for this video.  I am amazed not a wire was needed to be stripped, spliced, or crimped.  Everything falls into place perfectly. This is even better than most factory installed CarPlay as it links wirelessly upon start up.  Ultimately, it is not as hard as it looks-it is worth it!\\n\\nA few notes/speedbumps from my install:\\n\\nMy problem was video would show after pressing NAVI, but no sound.¬†¬†\\n\\n1.This overall theory needs to be stressed: the sound from CarPlay module comes through the standard PCM AUX input, and you have to press that prior to the NAVI button, which activates CarPlay on the screen.  If you don't press AUX first, it will play whatever audio you are on, while showing CarPlay.  Just leave your source on AUX and your car will seamlessly go to CarPlay every time automatically on startup.¬† \\n\\nI had disabled and hid the AUX button, previously, since I never used this older technology, instead using AUX BT (which I now disable/hide in favor for the JoyeAuto CarPlay).¬† I could not find a way to unhide the AUX input and ultimately had to do a PCM reset, to have it show up again.¬† After performing this reset, it appears and you can then select it, and have sound and full functionality.\\n\\nPerform a PCM handover (also known as a PCM hard reset):\\nPress and hold the Info button for approximately 10 seconds until the PCM reboots.\\nImmediately select the following from the CAR>>OPTION>>Set PCM System>>Reset PCM>>Vehicle Handover>>Yes>>Yes\\nPress and hold the Info button for approximately 10 seconds until the PCM reboots.\\n\\n\\n2. JoyeAuto is now including 6 screw mounts (screw 2 together (x3) for a tall support) for the circuit board install, so it sits higher and perfectly above the existing boards.\\n3. Turn off AUX/BT and just commit to using CarPlay fully.  This reduces connectivity and calling issues, and just simplifies everything.  Bottom line, you won't need the old PCM interface anymore.\\n4. Fuse board spot for Cayenne, is on the left side of the driver side dashboard, where the dash faces the door.  Pop off this panel and plug in fuse into a vacant spot that turns on and off with the key in and out of the ignition.  \\n5. Make sure to read and follow comments/tips from Fastpitch Net, very helpful must read notes!\\n6. SAT still works as a source in case you ever want to go back and use Sirius XM like normal, however, there is a CarPlay app for that, so you can just stay there and use that instead.\\n7. Make sure to go into settings and have the microphone do an automatic adjustment.  My callers were getting echo when talking handsfree, and this setting auto adjustment instantly fixed it.\\n\\nFeel free to ask any questions!, You have a brave heart to do this alone, the warranty is gone, right?, I have looked and looked to find a video like this and I must thank you for your very detailed video. Although mine is Android+997.2, I don't think it would be much different. Still looking pretty daunting job to tackle on but at least now I know what it involves in. By the way you put the JoyeAuto unit under the steering column but I was wondering if you held it in place with anything such as ziptie, double sided tape and so on. The space looked like it's a pretty tight fit and the unit wouldn't come out of that spot easily but I wouldn't like it if it rattles when I drive only because I didn't hold it in place with some sort of fastening method. \\n2 constructive criticisms are that your background musics are very cheesy (I respect your taste though) that I am not sure if they suit to these type of Porsche videos and that you put reverse rolling /dissolving effects on the captions that show the first sentence the last. It makes the viewers not able to see the whole captions clearly. No intentions to insult you in any way but just my thoughts. Thank you very much again for your helpful videos., Thank you üòä  great work I ordered one to my 911.1 I hope everything go smoothly all the best üëç, Planning to retrofit the Macan PCM4.0, looking for the best retrofit kit.
