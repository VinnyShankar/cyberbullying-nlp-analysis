Soon after, intelligence agencies noticed a surge in terrorist intercepts including reports of a jihadi kamikaze plane attack on the G-8 summit in Genoa which President George W Bush attended under the cover of missile batteries, closed airspace and fighter patrols later that summer. The State Department issued a \"Worldwide Caution\" and US military forces throughout the Persian Gulf were placed on a heightened state of alert. The CIA issued a briefing paper for senior Bush officials on 10 July stating, \"we believe that [bin Laden] will launch a significant terrorist attack against U.S. and/or Israeli interests in the coming weeks.\" Bush was presented with a CIA report as part of the President's Daily Brief (PDB) on 6 August entitled, \"Bin Laden Determined to Strike in US.\" The two-page document warned of an impending al-Qaeda attack (including hijackings) in New York and/or Washington DC:\n",

Bush was briefed of the situation during his PDB the following morning. \"I am very worried,\" Russian President Vladimir Putin told Bush during a phone conversation later that day. \"It makes me think something big is going to happen. They're getting ready to act.\" (Anthony Summers, The Eleventh Day, 358). That afternoon, Bush left Washington aboard Air Force One...\n",

      "The hijacker was a inexperienced pilot who couldn't even fly solo a small single engine Cessna. This is important because the maneuvers he made was over 500mph and are physically impossible to make. Even a fighter pilot said he couldn't do it. Pilots who flew 757's for years said it's impossible. Once they tried to make the same maneuvers on a flight simulator and it was successful. BUT they never released information on the speed they did the simulation. Other simulations were made they NEVER succeeded at or over 500mph. Two 6 ton titanium engine is completely missing. Only one single rotor was released by the FBI which isn't proof that a boeing 757 hit the building. Titanium can't be vaporized (But this is what the official story says). Yet the weakest part of the plane (fuselage) managed to survive. One of these fuselage parts have visible writing on them...
