Thats tesseract
He stole the thumbnail
Aerogel: 99.8% of airMy brain: Finally a worthy opponent!. So you are basically holding a piece of the sky.
Where can I buy it
Id be cool to see some Airsoft bb's out of aerogel imagine how far it could travel out of a sniper
So basically nasa never used it.
"8.35 if looking through aerogel is like looking through sky and sun appears orange during sun rise, why is it that it is not orange during mid day?"
"this may be a bit of a bother, sorry to ask, but can you warn about those cube models of aerogel molecules and stuffs? they look a lot like clusters of holes to me and i have trypophobia so its not easy to ignore and it freaks me out randomly, thank you! other than that, i can say i love this video! it is very informative and useful. thank you for your dedication to this subject."
"Pretty sure this is just a deriviation from whats called ""Blue Ice""? Which was found in Antartica, and now just recently got made ""official"" and its make up studied for decades now, literally like 99% of all ""modern"" tech. Blue Ice is originally almost like dry Ice. But not manufactured. Tesla didnt invent. He re-invented. Unlike Tesla, Microsoft, Apple... thieves and criminals, offspring from theives and criminals."
"Soon enough, school textbooks will be saying that this was invented in Africa by Africans"
"let de real estate developers find out, the rest will be history."
Rice grain be like = bruh
"Ah yes , the perfect measure of thermic insulation , the time it take for a chocolate bunny to melt"
now I want an aerogel umbrella
"It's great to know about aerogels that have really great and interesting properties. Watching the video about the various uses and roles of the aerogel, I found it very attractive. I'm also looking forward to watching the aerogel develop further. Not only do we hope for more innovation and development in the future, but we also look forward to seeing aerogels being used in new areas."
I want to eat it can I eat it too
thats the material we need to make the lightest gaming mouse
we can a suit  from here guys future is here
Bro u forgot about dust-
a really sophisticated advertisement is what the video is trying to say to me
can I eat some tipes?
Poor bunnies having to watch eachother burn to death
but what about the worlds solidest light?
My first thought when I saw the title was 'Wouldn't it be ice?'
Would it float in a gas with a higher density?
Bunny down
"Solidity is just an illusion.
                               -Quantum Physics"
I don't know.....i wanna eat that little thing
Vr headset made of this would be kinda neat
This is what I've been looking for for weightlifting this whole time!
"if something is mostly air then how is it still considered a ""solid"" to have density measured? Curious how the definitions are considered."
Isn't it the material of obeads
"I didn't expect the clinking sound because of the ""gel"" name."
"Why did you waste the chocolate bunny , I wanted to eat it ."
"""Charles Learned"" with no picture. Wonder if that was a real person, or someone made up to enhance Samuel Kistler's story. Very informative video, thx!"
Negative Energy Density Aerogel
NASA
2:05 Hmmm I bet Charles learned was a black man smh picture not found lol right
**The aerogel chocolate bunny watching her sister get burned alive**
1.22 gram weed nugget bout that size
Yooooo you looks so much like Rowan from viva la dirt league
"Why not add helium inside the gel? Then it'll be lighter than the air... (Hydrogen would be even lighter, but is flammable and so tiny that it may escape the walls)."
The fact that they did this in 1931 is actually what blows my mind; it reframes what I think of scientific progress and capability back then
Aerogel vs Glass ....did not seem right as Aerogel melting bunny was MUCH thicker?
So is my fart heavier than this?
Cotton candy?
"If it's full of air, a brick of it isn't a solid."
why did you kill that bunny im so sad
"For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death. (2 Corinthians 7:10)
The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. (2 Peter 3:9)
And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent: (Acts 17:30)"
I bet gaming mouse in 3080 are made with these kinds of materials
also called cristal meph
"That stuff is so comfortable ! I remember in iraq they said our 
Cushioning pads in our kevlar was aerogel"
"""i asked why is it such a good thermal insulator,"" ""what are it used for' ?"" way to answere 2nd question with the first question :) -.. anyhow cool material ..."
"These are neat thermal insulators but the really interesting application could be hydrogen storage or battery tech in the distant future. Once we figure out many more things we can start optimizing these materials to utilize their high surface area and potentially semiconductive backbone. Theoretically, they could be used to make photovoltaic cells too. The way we're playing with them now is kinda similar to how Edison and Tesla played with electricity. There are so many possible applications; maybe they can be catalytically doped and used as electrodes for water splitting? Who knows."
"Can you fill the gel with hydrogen instead of air will the mass float then, will it be flammable ? Can we then use it safely for airships ? So many questions."
"Now the thing is, can Spongebob pick this up?"
subnautica players: its time to craft a prawn suit
I know it may not be edible but i wanna see someone take a bite
No killing bunnies ok
So why didn't that float away
"Wow, they should look into making ultra thin drysuit undergarments for divers who dive in really cold water, this would be fantastic!"
I think this is the solid where they use in glasses of the spaceship i guess?
I want this
i want to see how it feels! im so curious
"This object is 99.8% air? 
That's amazing!"
Fogbank! Used in thermonuclear weapons
"Hear me out, *A 10 METER CLOUD WEIGHTS AROUND 500 TON*"
Silica (aero)gel seems quite delicious
Perfect for fake weights
Is it soft?
"Ini baru tontonan yg berbobot dan masuk akal sekali...ini baru berbobot, daging semua isinya"
I want to touch it !!!! Where can I?
"I need a guitar made out of this, right now!

Okay fine, maybe just a pickguard or the inlays."
when my friend asks me to share a piece of my food with them
we are in 2023 now....!!!!!
Fantastic work!
Joe Biden invented aerogel in 1971 shortly after his arrest for protesting segregation in South Africa.
LoL the comments about lays
Cotton is the lightest solid
Amazing.
Man did someone at FLIR spit out their coffee when you filmed a 1 dollar thermocouple with a 25k USD FLIR camera.
thats amazing
Why is the solid skeleton intact in high pressure in the first place? Why doesn't it crumble?
Lays finally has a competitor.
Replace the alcohol with hydrogen. It would float off your hand.
"Someone build a Gaming Mouse with it right now!

Edit: nvm, durability looks terrible."
This taught me more than school does
1:44 tse tse
drugs?
good
@_@ can we eat that.
What is its use
Tango!
"Charles Learned.
Right.."
"I remember reading about this in USA Today about 30 years ago. They had a picture of an Aerogel cube in a person's hand, and a candle flame in the background. They said that Aerogel worked so well, that if a room was fully insulated with the substance, the candle flame would be enough to heat the room. I thought that was so intriguing. And yet, I never really heard much about it again. I'm guessing it's both very expensive and very fragile to be practical in mass insulation production."
"At 0:20 : ""Some aerogels are so light that if you removed all the air from them, they would be less dense than air.""

Doesn't that sentence imply that they are less dense than air WITH the air inside? And wouldn't that imply that these aerogels would float in air? I don't see how the density could go from less than air to more than air by just adding air. lol."
I want to hold that so badly and squeeze it
Can you eat it?
What happen if we put the aerogel in vacuum
11:35 oxygen not included anyone?
My brain said: Ohh.. it's a sponge. Made with something else.
I bet the dust on it is heavier
"Arogel : I consist of mostly air
Lays : friends ?"
thought what if we make clothes out of airgel it might look a bit strange but at the right time it will be very useful like a hot weather fire
"Hello Veritasium,
Can aerogel be able to form heat protection shields for the reentry into the atmosphere as well?"
The worlds lightest thing is just checking on phone at 3am
"A tiny one hair baby be like : finally, a worthy opponent, our battle will be legendary!"
Graphine arogel is the worlds lightest thing it is 7 times lighter than air
I wonder if you could make a jacket out of it? Just think how light it would be!
Mark Rober Budget Version
Man drank too much veritaserum
It's more like silicon gel
Squeeze it
They should line safes with it . Fire rating would be phenomenal

"Space engineers are talking about using aerogel as a building material in O'Neill cylinders.  It can create hills, and valleys without adding a lot of mass on the inside of such a structure."
"This is incredible it's like a solid cloud if you know what I mean. the aerogels, could be used in so many medical techniques to be able to improve the  the touch and feel of a solid matter. i feel. let me know what you all think?"
Look at these humans not setting back and observing nature instead manipulate it and then come up with what nature and things are man yall humans live backwards man
My Weed weight less in same sice
1 gram of pot only weighs 1 gram
Looks like the blue stuff walter cooks
So arogel will replace the toxic insulation?
Than sponge?

Can they be made to polarize light for solar panels on balloons is the question to ask.
can you eat it
"retard how bout salt
im a black asian too"
My first thought for real world applications would be integrating aerogel into firefighting jackets and boots and pants
fodase parcero
"Amazing! Can we use this as a sweater for our lipo battery that we used on our quadcopters? In winter, the battery depletes so quickly since it's very cold. Can that prevent cold air from touching the battery?"
lays comments is fire
How about a H2 balloon?
It looks delicious
Awesome!
put that on the starship)!
Military uses for protecting against lasers.
Eat it
That's amazing
It looks like something I ate in my dream
"1:51This brand of chocolate is really tenacious6:14Wrong demonstration! The experimental material is not edible? And is this material poisonous after heating?Will this material become a fire suit in the future? Or a house or car insulation and fireproof material
Is it soundproof?"
How much does 98.8 percent air cost
Is it wrong that I want to eat the aerogel
Is it costly to produce it???
"Scientists.....the de-evolution of humour, worst comedians ever! "

Gologram gels
"Well, paper clips are only 1 gram, so I'm not sure that's the lightest solid"
Could aerogel be used as an insulator instead of the ceramic tiles on a spaceship eg. Starship?
"Feather: I am the lightest in the world!


Aerogel: hold my air"
"Can you replace the ""air"" with helium to make it even lighter?"
I did not think we had to see so much of rabbit melt

I'm studying about this at school. Thanks Veritasium
Cube ufo is this.
I once put aerogel made of peanut butter on my penis to see how my German shepherd would react.
So does that mean we can find and extract water from somewhere in space?!
spray paint spray on insulation so many things this can be used.
This dick is solid too. Every morning.
COULD AEROGEL  be the answer to a very useful 250 gram Drone?
"do you guys know half air, half sound?"
I'm slightly offended you would say smoking bunny. That's a hell of a euphemism right there.
I wonder if that would work in a firesuit for racecar drivers?
"Another video which is amazing is on the channel NileRed where he makes aerogel in his lab, I was surprised with how complicated it is to actually make this."
It's pretty too
I want that

Lays Vs This solid
"it sounds like metal when it hits the desk, amazing"
if you coat yourself with aerogel. can you swim faster since there will be less water weight drag because you wont be wet?
homie had a spiritual experience seeing a supercritical fluid for the first time o_o
Cool
Now I want some chocolate
I held some of this in 1992 when I was in high school. My science teacher had some for us
"Is the Aerogel very much flexible, if Yes can they be folded?"
At the end... was i seing water going through the aerogel???
What does it taste like?
so what you are saying is you can actualy eat that
this is what unrendered Minecraft chunks are made out of
Can't believe you used a yellow flame on the bunsen burner
Areogel is the lightest solid made of more then one atom. The lightest solid is the lightest atom.
I really want to see and learn more about Aero Gel.
crazzzyyyyyyyyyyy
Bro got thick air
Aerogel looks like something I'll put in my e-rig nail and dab it
What does it FEEL like?
"i wonder if i ate it, would i jsut a punch of air"
4:14
How does this work in Space?
Good
Silica? As in quartz crystal?! Cool.
"i wonder is it possible to use it as other insulation for example water bottle, it would be cool though, but I guess it would be pricey as well"
This is Elon if he was a YouTuber
"""This object is 99.8% air""
Vacuum Cleaner - let's suck this bad guy in"
Would aerogel make for good screen protectors for phones since it scatters the color blue more then red/yellow?
Am I the only person who wants to bite Aerogel?

pov your phone in your pocket:
Why doesn't it float?
"Ok I'm lost and I have tried to figure this one out. Why is it transparent in the infrared? Shouldn't it be opaque?? If it is transparent in the infrared then would that mean it can transfer radiating heat. So it would absolutely fail as insulation when a black body was emitting heat? I am not a scientist and my  question is sincere so if there's an obvious answer thanks in advance. Or did he simply misspeak when he said that it is transparent in infrared, and opaque in ultraviolet. Is it simply flipped where it is transparent in the ultraviolet and opaque in the infrared? Or is there something I am just not getting?"
Is it hard or flexible?
Kayanya masih ringan busa.
It's a LOLSQUID
Killing me. Bring the mini series. How about Alon next.
Why does this feel like an add for aerogel
But doesn't it conduct heat by infrared radiation? Since it's transparent to it
Has anyone seen my head? It got blown off my shoulders when the water passed THROUGH the aerogel.....
"99.9% air, just like the brains of the Democrat politicians in office!"

How does it taste??
Groovy
Why isn't this used as insulation then?
LD/ ?????
You are scientists and you are comparing substrate of different thickness (chocolate bunny)? It's pointless.
Can they make aerogel that likes absorbing some liquids rather than others? Then use them to clean up oil spills.
The aerogel trilogy never came to be!
use it some car parts or make a engine in future
Air udara ya ndes bukan air yang biasanya diminum minimal pinter ginian lah ya meskipun gabisa bahasa enggres

We can make fighter jets with less mass and high speed range
"is it eatable? if yes, it's tasty?"
can you eat it...
"If there is an aerogel that had all the air removed that is less dense than air, would it float?"
"The Bunsen burner wasn't using the hottest part on the aerogel, but it was on the petri dish. Shame."
Aerogel was on a programme called Tomorrows World in 1989

"Liquid Carbon Dioxide?  I thought it had no liquid state.  I was taught in University in 1976 that dry ice was carbon dioxide in solid form and by a process of sublimation it went directly from a solid to a gas bypassing a liquid state.  I guess  ""the times, they were a changin'."
"After 2 years of YouTube recommending this video to me, I finally caved in."
I heard on a different channel that if you rub the aerogel all over your body you'll go back to being heterosexual if you were guay

Ohhhh my goddddd
Someone needs to use this in my stainless steel water bottle!!  Ice for days!!!!!  :D
Weren't the spaceshuttle heat tiles also some sort of aerogel?

So goofy
is it edible
Can I eat it tho?
"Veritasium: Aerogels are the world's lightest solids.

Graphite Aerogel is lighter
"The world's lightest solid weighs 122 Grams. This is what a feather weighs

How much does a feather weigh? Ornithologists usually measure the feathers of birds as a proportion of total body weight. According to Cobb-Vantress, the feathers of a 5-pound broiler chicken weigh about 74 grams or 2.6 ounces, or 3.3 percent of its body weight."

"my middle school science teacher actually showed us that!! we couldn't experiment on it since she only had one little sample though, it was still cool nonetheless"
Can you put it In a vacuum chamber
There's a lot of organic and polymer chemistry in aerogels. Very exciting materials!
My phone is like 155 grams not that impressive.
They should have lit 2 burners at the same time and heated both bunnies at the same time.
What if you did that presses with hydrogen
What would happen if u threw it up???
Wicked. Very clever stuff.
"Aerogel: made by 99.8% air

"I think the title is kind of misleading.
Aerogel might be the least dense _structure_ , but it is not ""the least dense material"" 
gaps filled with air don't change the propertires of a material.
We don't say a balloon or a metal cage are made of very light materials because they are mostly made of air, do we? they're still just rubber or metal"

"World lightest solid? 
Bruhh Plastic can be basically lightest solid"
what about the 1% bacteria tho?
Me: i wanna see you drop it. Is it floating?
It's like pushing brake to the energy traped by the maze of the structure. I think may be a form of degeneration of energy in a quantum level against convention using that special liquid gas. I was thinking about it a long time ago but I never expect they made one of these clever piece for protection. Amazing

Paper crying rn
can u make an armor of that? Fire protection 100
Tesseract is that u
This needs to be an armor in fallout that has like super high flame resistance and weighs nothing
bro took a peace of the sky
Have a good day and know That Jesus love You
the video underneath this video for me is ANOTHER ONE of this
The lightest solid is a Atom...
"""This object is 99.8% air""


My dad: yes, a worthy opponent"
"I think Aurogel is a good thing to used for racing car. Since they are Very lightwight and also a good isolator. 

That's mean they got more weight reduction and also cooling of the cockpit from the engine heat.

But still I think it's a bad idea to use 100% aurogel for the race car body. That would be like apaper plane with a engine..."
"Cap, i picked up a piece of hair while watching this."
Wait hold on I gotta go find a gel sack and a ruby
Ha obviously you use aerogel for subnatica
Lulyeah momento 1:58
Nah my weed lighter
53 million views gj!
barrier block goes brrrrr
It is so so so so cool I love it
I wonder if this is bad for the environment.
Does aerogel suffer like the plastic? I mean is it eco-friendly?
I am surprised this isn't Nile red
The chocolate bunny thing was so sad to watch. You can't let chocolate go to waste!
bio that's Elon Musk
"pretty sure I have seen solid masses about that size  that weigh about 1 gram, that are not aerogel. they usually cost me $20 back in the day."
Lays:We are about announcing that we are going make new chip called aerochip
thats like an ice cube... I CANT SEE IT IF ITS LIKE AN ICEEE
I actually have a chunk of it in a box its very delicate and fireproof
"Solids: What does he do?
Air: what we do, but better"
try to hold air lol
Remove all the air rIGht now
where is the space stone?
You guys are so smart
Dust: hold my atom
Smush it
My model o lighter
This is exactly what our Andisters will be dealing with if there is the possibility of us time traveling in my opinion.
Why am i thinking of subnautica?
I used it for soaps
What happend if u eat it
I kind of want to see someone try to bite it.. 0-0
SUB :)
a grain of sand?
"With a last name like ""Learned"" you had better be an academic."
If you drop it then you can say the sky is falling
looks like what watermelon taste like
Its look like's stick glue
paper
Forbidden jello
10:10
"Still, spongebob will still not be able to pick it up"
Why dont they just cut it up to make it even lighter?
So I guess you can see air
Guys where did you buy the choco bunnies i wanna eat them
Make a rubix cube with this lol
"OMG imagine if they made an aerogel phone!!! Or Nintendo, that really would be a Nintendo switch lite!"
1.2 looks like 28g.
It s like 28 g. Wow i love it make a water seed go kart.
Your holding peace of solid sky?
this is really amazing how human brain can create things which not all of us can do...every human are unique ....
I'm the only one waiting for someone to bite that?
I feel so bad for the chocolate bunnies they just wanted to live
"aerogel: I'm light go burr

chips: finally a worthy apon-

aerogel: nope, still light considering your 90% air

chips: *Lucky for you that's what I like*"
No  a crumbs lighter
Can you make alcohol jelly?!?
Thank you for using metrics
AW
I BELIEVE I CAN TOUCH THE SKYyy
Someone should include this technology on home windows and car windows. It's still clear enough to see through. Think of the money we could save on home heating and cooling?!
I just wondered what would happen to airgel if you put it in a vacuum & tried to pull the air out lol
when you realize that vertasium is litterally vertasirum but without the r and that the motto is an element of truth (harry potter fans will understand)
"Lays:I am the lightest solid

Areogel:Think again"
"Cut that in half and it'll become lighter and make it in a larger size and it'll become heavier, how can you call it the lightest solid showing some random volume"
So ur telling me balloons if hevier
Now there's a new way to lose weight fast and effective.
minecraft air block in real life
killing chocolate bunny you rat
At the first I thought it was ice
I made my car body out of this stuff
why do I wanna eat it
The 1st thought that came to my mind was why aren't we using this for insulation
where can you buy this
Technically Marijuana is
"lays u have a competitor,,,,...."
"R

















N







M"
this stuff is cool... my chemistry teacher in high school had a piece of this and we all got to hold it... it's weird...
Thought Trump had that claim .. 99.8% air.
But how you can insulte something with that aerogel if it is so fragile material?
Rendering stlll
"It has a mass of 1.22g.
A nug that size would also weigh around that."
Healthy ass Dime 1.22
Cool !  (mini ha-ha )    :O)
Can you make a back pack and tent out of this
*smash it with a hammer*
For the longest time I thought this was a daily dose of internet video until I clicked on this
thanks for add persian subtitle :)
Cut it into small piece
"There's a substance I call Napheneogel, And It's basically a near perfect If not completely perfect hybrid of Carbon-Nanotubes, Graphene, and Aerogel."
The flame on the first bunny is at least two times bigger. Thats how you cheat on an experiment.
"I wonder if you could put aereogel in vacuum and coat it with something to seal it.  If you took it out into the air, would it float because of the internal vacuum?  If that worked, you could make some interesting transport vehicles with it.  A drone made of it could travel for hours."
Amazing stuff.

Cant even roll a blunt with that 1.22
"49,999,999 clicks by copy-ready chinese"
Barrier blocks irl
Need to make a gaming mouse shell out of this
I want arogel in my engine bay lol
Biden's brain.
But we are critical of this named critical...
cubed smoke
"mi  piacerebbe comprare un pezzo di aerogel , ma non ho idea di come procurarmelo  
I'd like to buy a piece of aergel, but I have no idea how to get it!"

Did anyone ever test to produce Aerogel with superfluid Helium instead of CO2? Should be very much lighter.
More science please!
It's a rectangular balloon.
"Hydrogel, DARPA."
why the poor chocclate bunnys
Insane
So Contact Lenses are made of Aerogel?
They should make this stuff with hydrogen instead of air.
"Does that bunny experiment count as ""animal testing""?"
man looks like middle class elon musk
What about a feather
When will Home Depot start selling this?
Its just like my eraser
Is it expensive to get some?
Now just mix this with the video about growing cells in fruits and boom we have printable human organs
Amazing
maybe Elon can use aerogel on his starships instead of the heavy tiles he uses at the moment
They should make dinner plates out of this material to avoid heating issues. Nice! innovative
How does it work against noise? Could you make a soundproof window out of it?
"Idiot, you put aerogel on a scale and refered to the reading as it's ""mass"". Please tell me that you don't think weight and mass are the  same thing."
Fascinating.
Wow!
"Carefully , Chinese  must be watching this"
I wonder what areogel would be like to sleep on??
What would happen if you removed the air and covered the skeleton with a graphene skin? ie would it be possible to make a vacuum bubble
THE WORLDS LIGHTEST SOLID WOULD BE COTTON CANDY
finally a material which can withstand the extreme tempratures in space..
Sounds like hot air to me!!!!
about as dense aa the weed i get from my dealer
that stuff is so cool I actually got to play with some in elementary school one of my classmates dad's worked for NASA brought in a couple pieces
How about if someone makes aerogel costumes for the fire brigade? That way anyone stranded inside a burning house can be easily rescued.
I immediately thought this might make a good intake box. Just need to sort out its structural strength.
"""Worlds lightest solid""

I beg to differ sir we started a game we never got to finish. Pay for blood remember?
Have you ever laid out a fart so heavy that your neighbors complained? Hell I even complained!!
It was like rancid sewer, like a skunk died and went to hell and came back just to say hello."
he LOVES aerogel
Next vid: take the air out and see if it floats in the air
No piece of aky don't have air but it does.
Reverse engineering finally got figured out
IIM GETTING THAT
"My King Mattress is 100% Aero Gel , I Dream Of Floating On A Cloud ."
"So what you're saying is that you could theoretically do this with someone's, um, gaseous emissions? For research purposes, of course."
"There are too many comments for me to see if anyone else pointed out that an aerogel code named ""fogbank"" plays a key role in thermonuclear weapons."
Now I want aerogel!
Boris Johnson
Imagine the 90% savings on energy when your house will be insulated with this material. Amazing.
This guy kinda looks like Elon Musk lol
At 4 am I've actually learned something cool
Looks like he took a piece of air out of the sky.
Do a weight comparison: aerogel vs. osmium !!!!!
GIVE ME MY AIR BACK
yo mama so weak that when she tried to crush it it crushed her fingers
Important for hydrogen bombs.
I want to bite it
great channel.
"You had me on ""aerogel,"" where can I find the ingredients?"
"The chunky reindeer anatomically flower because temperature hisologically provide into a utter armchair. rampant, brawny dahlia"
My best friend is a super critical fluid
The power of an Air Force is terrific when there is nothing to oppose it . WC
"6:13 ""I'm interested in trying some of this chocolate here"" someone ""gross"". Lol wut?"
Can you blow through it?
Awesome
"Let it go 

I wanna see it fly"
ever seen weed?
So you want your house insulated with aerogel
Even 2 ants could pick that up and easily carry it
so he is basically holding air.
0.2% air less than chip bags
I have a ceramic aerogel insulation in my pyrolosis reactor
So cool!
Goated vid
Touched the sky finally.
super dense
Why do I want to bite into that?
School toilet paper would like to have words.
when americans say 'jelly'  do they mean jam or jelly?
why did u burn chocolate bunnies? :(
"Take the hydrophobic versions of Aerogel, make microspheres out of it, mix it into water and sawdust, freeze it to make Pykrete, and it would maintain it's shape even in warm temperatures for weeks! Pykrete already maintains its shape for much longer than a similarly sized block of ice, but the addition of Aerogel may make it thermally resistant enough that, say, a Pykrete barge would be a practical, economical means of shipping large, heavy objects."
"For 20 years, I've wanted to insulate a house with that"
I wonder if they used water if it can be used as a radiation shield
So literally Air 2
Ok youtube I will watch it
Styrofoam or glass fall?
areJOE MAMA
"I have been seeing this video on my suggestion feed over and over for weeks now, more than any other unseen video has been suggested to me EVER. Every time I get on my phone or PC, there it is, at the top of my feed. And after about five minutes of scrolling, there it is again. I am now watching it just so it will go away and I see 51,891,488 views. Everything makes sense now."
When the halo music hits.
"Imagine if you were to create a more solid version of this, you would have the lightest aerodynamic spacecraft in the universe hypothetically able to mold into light itself if we can utilize this concept as a heavier solid, maybe by more densely packing the air molecules? You would have ""metal"" and I quote this for the lack of wording, that would be malleable enough to travel through hyperspace without possibly morphing your ship too much and you due to gravity? is this the future?"
Wonder if they can apply this technology for people who need to eject water from their systems like kidney patients. Like create a nanotechnology with aerogel that will clean the blood of toxins and extra  fluid (a problem kidney patients deal with).
Buhbnkvt7tix
is it possible to make efficient windows out of aerogel?
I just want to crush it
POV: im so weak that i cant even lift the aerogel
Cool:)))
How tf did i get here?
CPD done on  routine basis in EM globally.
What is it's rigidity status?
I want to eat that chocolate bunny
It is so great invention... You can discover new things using this... I can't wait what will be the use of it...what is the Important contributions of it to technology..
ohh hi there year 8 wassup im farhan ahha
Veritasium would be the best physics teacher.

"""This is 99.8% air""
School toilet paper: *are you challenging me?*"
he looks like elon musk
Thanks for your new information about aerogel
Is it edible ? cuz it's looks tasty I'd eat that
I thought plastic is the lightest solid in the world
"Aerogel technologies in Boston: *brick building*

FIGURES. I always associate brick with the east coast, especially Boston"
He said 1. TWO TWO cuz he was too lazy to say twenty two like mee
Aerogel dive suits????
Can this type of tech filter sea water?
This is so cool

"If you have successfully made and shaped aerogel, does that make you an Aerosmith?"
"This is like a cheat item??? Light, super fire proof, like wow this will be seen alot when im older"
Why are we not talking about alcohol jellies?
Imagine 2019 L
This video is so satisfying to watch
Hey paper is a solid right well it's more lighter like leaves
i want to eat it
what if we look at aerogel against the sunset?
p
So can I eat it
Ur 1 click can change my whole life
Ur one click can change my life
we use that to protic us sun light
I wish they showed us stuff like this in school... I would have tried way harder in math and science if I knew that was a career option.
me now knowing the answer why the sky is blue o_O
It would be cool if there was an aerogel shield that protects you from heat
"aerogel: 99% air
comment section: 99% chip bag jokes"
"Waoo, it is amazing:33"
Does AeroGel Float?
"I wonder if we could use this process of making aerogel to capture carbon from combustion engines and then reuse that material for building materials, auto parts, etc. or just bury it?"
The video is very detail and easy to understand. Now I knew what is the aerogel and it's feature. And it has aerospace application. Thank you very much!
Imagine this material for an ironman armor
"Make shoes out of it, call them ""Skywalkers""."
The fact that this wasn't in the nature before and it was invented by a human. world is fascinating
why can't we use Air gel to replace plastic bags?
this dude is a genius.
Are firefighters using something like this?
"Only $23,000/lb"
Gtf yll no nasa full of shiii
Nice
Great Video!
Ok now i know my future bass trap
how it feels to chew 5 gum

"What happens if I use this in a vacuum?
The return of the spaceship is exposed to high heat, but in the vacuum class there are no bubbles, but the vacuum also has very little heat conduction.
After that, what about the radiant heat generated by the passage of heat rays and energy?"
"When it was first made it was called Ghost Gel, back in the mid to late ""90""s."
"So I get what it is, but how does it act as a solid if it has a liquid-gas molecular structure? Also, what would happen if it were to be less dense than air?"
Paper ?
Algum BR pra explicar o que seja isso?
oh now ur house has a sky
So none of this tech existed during our moon landings so the delicate electronics and photo equipment would have been damaged by extreme temperatures.  Hence moon travel and space travel is a hoax in order to divert funds elsewhere.
Airogel ? spelling. Used to capture light. Crashed on reentry if I remember correctly.
Mong opo ko mas
busa
very informative
"Will aerogel replace plastic, rubber and Styrofoam? If yes, is this environment friendly?"
Anyone here cause of Subnautica?
