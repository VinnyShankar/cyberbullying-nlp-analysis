0:38 96 Million Views Soon! Another rare sight to observe
"""Is it safe to drink with the balls in the water"", as they drive a speedboat through the reservoir"
Fun observation: one day the amount of balls in this reservoir will be equal to the views of this video
"This has 94,000,000 views. Waiting for 2,000,000 more views so the number of views and the number of balls in title match."
Balls
Two things one who agrees that he must have been on a night out with his mates when coming up with this video two why so many plastic balls and don't you feel sorry for the people who have to clean up the balls and the fish in that reservoir probably thinking those human twits they are blocking our sun light for shame and why a reservoir
So shade balls are for providing shade? Go figure.
"Why are there 96,000,000 views on this video?"
Like my comment
So if you fall your f u c k e d. Probably right
Reservoir Balls
What about micro plastics in drinking water?
"1 million and a couple more viewers to make 96, 000, 000 views"
Huge respect to the 48 million black men that sacrificed their testicles for the making of this reservoir
"wow im sure theyre not toxic at all, being made of plastic and sitting in the sun all day"
when this video got 96M view :)
Imagine the number of ligmas that can fit there
"They black balls went to the reservoir because africa has no water

















It's just a joke I'm not racist"
Imagine someone drowned there...
"Almost as many views 94m, as there are balls 96m"
48.000.000 victims of racism...
Nearly 96million views
96 million views though almost
I'm shocked Kim didn't show up
Technically this is the ultimate littering
What happens during rain ?
That explains why Louisiana has one of the highest cancer rates
"How about the COLORADO BASIN, instantly Thought about this.. When I Seeing NEWS ON the Evaporated BASIN"
Here before it gets 96 000 000 views
"Ive got 96,000,000 balls around me"
stopping evaporation also not good for environment and birds & other animals isn't it
sounds like my kind of friday night
You can skip the first three minutes. 3:00
That one guy in the math problem:
Mmmmm melting plastic water
"I only counted 95,999,999."
So some company in L.A. is selling water that has been stolen from the people in Northern California?  That is some BS!
"96 million balls, 94 million likes"
"Why do we clean the water and put it in the reservoir instead of cleaning the water from the reservoir and giving it to the consumers, this is what is done in our countries? Can someone explain this to me please ?"
"Why not floating solar, with at the very edges the balls to leas off the space between the panels and the embankment? This would generate some serious money with, as far as I can see, the same benefits."
96
The chemicals in those crappy balls are known to cause cancer in the state of California
"""It's very rare for you to see 96 million of anything."" -This video is almost hitting 96 million views in 2023"
"Fatele bianche , assorbiranno meno il calore ."
I like how there's basically as many views on this video as there is balls.
Why are the shade balls black?  It seems white would be more  appropriate for providing shad and reflecting heat.  What a I missing here?  Thanks.
So NASA is considering dumping 700 billion silver balls into the Artic circle to reflect the sun's rays back out into space
"No matter how much I look at it, that just seems like an inefficient solution to a difficult problem. The lake looks mutilated and dead,  is what they meant when he said "" there is no wind and the water is stable. """
Views on this video almost equal the number of balls!
Kim Kardashian has entered the chat.
gas outboard motor .. you should fill up your garbage can with water and run a outboard motor in it for 1 minute . and get a good idea what these people just did to your drinking water . scrubbing agile is an easier clean
I bet Kim Kardashian would like to swim here
Not smart to pollute the ocean with plastics.
I sure do love black balls
I want 1 ball for play cricket
"About as many as kim kardashian has handles, not quite, but close enough i'd say"
I looked up that meme of the dude saying black black n*gga balls HD and it gave me this
"Ah yes, the average Kardashian weekend"
i cant use plastic straws because they damage the environment but the the water authority can put millions of plastic balls into the water supply! shut up and pay your taxes
"So wait, the water is treated, and then just sits in on open-air reservoir? How is it safe to drink?"
"There is almost 96,000,000 Views on this video."
Won't the black help absorb sunlight and contain it here on earth's surface? Further adding to the global warming?
"I cant believe they dont use bird balls at the Berkley Pit in Butte Mt. I strongly  recommend tourists do not visit, if a bird lands on the water, it usually dies instantly. Its a defunct mining pit, not a reservoir, but youd think we could save the birds from a horrible death"
Its not rare to see 96 million of anything there could be 96million litrs of water in ocean or trees in forests
"What a crock of balls,,  I think that they have balls in there brain cavity"
"That's exactly what i thought when i first saw them: i says:  ""what's with all the black balls?"" i says"
How much balls are damaged by the boat propeller
"I guess we can say that this reservoir is really ""ballsy""."
Short answer Is To prevent Evaporation
"Gotta love how the water treatment safety measures make the water toxic , lol ..and to top it off let's throw water poluting plastic in the drinking water to make it safe again . Lol"
Only 2 Million views and we have the same amount of views on this vid. Seems gud
96M BALLS and 96M PEOPLE watching this viedeo
Wow
This videos almost has as many views  as the amount of shade balls in that reservoir
how did they filled it into that trailer without any bags or something
You have one view on this video for each one of those black balls in the reservoir! 94M views to date
why are the balls black exactly?
I'd give her some boba
Black may be the wrong color.  Should work like a heat sink instead    .
Salted balls in my mouth
One question you did not ask is how long you would survive if you fell in the water without a life vest??
"""No not nuts."" Balls."
Todays day and age has entirely way to much plastic in our  lives .  Cancers are all we hear about.
How much do they cost each ?
Each ball of this video is a wiew
This video almost has as many views as this lake has balls
It's like a minecraft lake but the pixels are round.
Water just stored out in the open like that. Sounds dangerous to drink!
"I love the kinda subdued conversation on the boat. ""Wow."" *staring at the balls* ""yeah it's a little out there"" ""do you give tours for people"" *some more staring at balls* ""Do you like boba?""
It's almost like they're all stoned lol"
0:36  he says 96 million of anything is rare to come by yet he almost has that many views on this video
I wonder why black and not white. I wonder if the water is monitored for contaminants from the plastic that is  potentially degrading in the sunlight to a greater extent than would be for say buried pipe.
While talking about plastic in water is a bad thing. Ok
it's the mostest diverse lake in the world
"""Forget it Jake. It's Chinatown."""
This video almost get 96 million views. Coincidence? I don't think so.
Those balls arent going to shed microplastics?
30years later: bisfenol A crisis
This video almost has as many views as there is balls in the reservoir!
"I am curious why L.A. does chlorinate its tap water for the purpose of disinfection. Here in Germany this is totally unusual. Tap water is one of the most supervised goods here but usually the water does not get chlorinated. In fact, chlorine is rarely used to overcome temporary situations in which contamination thresholds are exceeded.
Are there any reasons why U.S. cities are forced to use chlorine along with the risk of producing bromate in the water?"
The specs of this computer must be INSANE if it can handle 96 million physics objects all in one spot like this
Just wondering if it wouldn't be possible to have them be light rather then dark to reflect the sun rather then absorbing the heat from it.
What is this mr beast type video
96m such an even number.
"""You rarely see 96 milion of anything""
Soon we'll see 96 milion views on this video too"
What will be done when the ball's lifespan comes to an end? And how will anyone know when that time has come?
"messed up the fishing ,that's for sure"
Actually I'm not sure why they used 'Black' balls. Black absorbs heat which would increase evaporation.
Would it be better to use white balls?
There are nearly as many balls as this video has views. Just wow.
Wow 10/10 big balls mmmm
What happens if you fall in?
"Love how he said ""we made this unfortunate scientific discovery that actually really wasnt part of any regulatory scheme"" lmao"
They should be white.  Black creates heat and heats the water increasing evaporation
That all belongs to Kim Kardashian.
"Cool, at least until some small children charge in thinking it is a giant play ball pit... ;-)"
"When some costume wearing guy repeats something is ""absolutely harmless"" 5 times, it makes me think..."
they look like huge caviars lmao
The solar degradation of these plastics into the water cannot be a good thing.
"How does water go from a filtration plant to a reservoir and then direct to homes? Eeww, what century is America living in? Surely the filtration plant comes between the reservoir and the customer? Mate, that is literally the answer to the problem."
"He had me laughing when he said bro-mate, what's next bro-mance?"
"Hi Derek, in the presence of current evidence, it might be worth to check how much microplastic these balls deposit into the water."
Thats creepy like something out of Minecraft lol
Black Balls Matter
"From my understanding plastic is also a carcinogenic, then here some way some how the problem is atill there.  As is saying ""what is best the illness or the cure"", let's  face it, we are where we are, and things are not getting better."
Big black juicy balls
yeah I dont trust a single thing that water health expert is saying. US cancer rates have only gone up and up and up...and im pretty sure...plastic in food..and water...maybe just maybe has something to do with it.
To imagine having 82 more of these to equal out to how many humans we have on earth.
2M views more and this video will have as much balls as views.
"""Why Are 96,000,000 Black Balls on This Reservoir?""

So that the oil  and plastic industry can make money? (And: Microplastics is a terrible thing...)"
After this video hits 96 million views it should become illegal to watch.
The environment world saver guys won't have an answer to this . Balls made from PLASTIC !!!  a product of OIL!!
"Sent from the reservoir to tap, not tested at the tap? Unbelievable"
Black person eggs.....better start locking your doors.
So you make them BLACK to absorb the heat of the Sun?!
"So, the black balls will absorb heat and transfer it to the water, microbs will thrive. What will they be growing under the shade balls now? i mean, some of us learned warm conditions create the perfect environment for bacteria to reproduce and and grow to potentially dangerous levels. Especially if there is little rain."
Nasty .  Boats driving around in the drinking water lol .
if you need to do this you should question your water concept. i ve never seen anything like this in europe.
any info on an update for this?  not able tofind anything
Is it because of the crazed paranoia regarding climate change?
I absolutely admire the enthusiasm that the guy had while explaining the shade balls. He clearly has a deep passion for his work.
lets mix plastic and water and pat ourselves on the back.
This video is at 94M views right now. So almost every ball is 1 viewer
"Dr Bryan White lol, he is the fusion of Bryan Cranston and Walter White is it? LOL, always a good scientist"
Lol guy just did a Mr beast video with out even trying
I thought the largest collection was in Africa
Dam loitering birds. Should've put a no loitering sign
Mr. Incredible's worst nightmare
Soon this video will have each viewer watching 1 ball
"oh come on, I can handle way more than that"
"If the food grade plastic doesn't leech into the water, why does store bought water have expiration dates on them? We have been told that the plastic water bottles will eventually leech and contaminate the water."
"Roughly as many views as balls on that lake, impressive"
why are they polluting the reservoir with oil??
"all those chemicals in those plastic balls leaching into someone's drinking water....
INVERSION....when THEY tell you something's good for you - it's usually not...."
"ALMOST 96M VIEW BOYS
WE CAN DO IT"
balls.
I would think white would be better
Mr incredible sweating rn
You used to see birds loitering lol
Cuz 'This Reservoir' is your mom?
Guess microplastics aren't a concern
Is this video about balls? I LOVE BALLS!
"Hey, we're approaching a point where there's going to be as many people who've watched this a balls in there."
"hey Mr Affleck.  your videos are cool  
but fvcking promotions are not  
I would rather not watch you videos at all than sit thru ads  

BTW, I'm older and a former college employer cleaned out their library and I took maybe 30 math books  
they will keep me well educated for the erst of my life  
and no ads"
"96,000,000 balls would take a lot of men"
Can we expect something when the visualizations of this video will reach 96 Million? It would be great!
The first 96 million to watch this video get to claim one of the balls
"Wait, wouldn't it be stupid to Reduce evaporation in California. 
You know, No Evaporation = No Rain
No Rain = Extremely Heated Climates.
Extremely Heated Climates= Settlements without water becoming more desert like"
Because the earth has way too much clean water
"maaan, they form crystal planes on the surface, that's so cool"
Nice expensive ball pit you got there!
Let me guess...they EVOLVED there.....
Surprised Cali would embrace plastics made from hydrocarbons
Good place for fishing I bet.
There's almost 1 shade ball per person viewing this video. That's insane.
"I was looking for a comment that gave me an update on this project, didnt find it"
"How else will they give everyone cancer, digestive issues, and harmone disruptors?"
"Soon : Why Are 96,000,000 Views on This Video?"
love the air quality if you're neighbour?
Black?
Who actually counted how many shade balls were in the pond?
"If there were any fish in that reservoir, then they are all dead now due to lack of oxygen."
Get this to 96 million views!!!
"Why 96 mil, not a 100?"
I think you got a bunch of black guys out there very familiar with a similar issue.
"I am waiting for 96,000,000 views on this video"
They should use an airboat
I really like the guy from the waterworks talking. Sounds so uplifting.
YES I WATCH THIS VIDEO I GET A BALL YAY
The one place I wouldn't want to cannonball.
"8:35 Umm... interesting that ""HEALTHY"" was in finger quotes..."
the boat is injecting exhaust into water people drink without further processing?
"96,000,002 when I get there"
There are many black balls in my bed.
96M shade balls and almost 96M views.
"""Thats alot of balls""

-Manscaped"
"96,000,000 balls almost got 96,000,000 views"
if only this video got 96 million views
I like black balls
This video almost has as many views as there are balls on this reservoir
i think you should do about how they do produce the ball and how long does it take to do the balls?
1l
"*""My balls is MY WORD and I DON'T BREAK EM.. FOR NO ONE!!""*"
Title is sus
The real question is why are there 96 million black balls in my GF's bedroom? Cause she really likes black balls ;)
"Still 1901839 views needed 
So that, 
1 black ball = 1 views"
Why is California broke again?
why are the reservoirs open to begin with? why can't the water be in a container? ALSO NEARLY $32M FOR THOSE?!
so what will happen if a person fall into the reservoir?
Why didn't they remove the chlorine....didnt france do that with UV filtration?
"In a current climate, we could instal floating solar panels. Effect will be the same, plus some power will be generated."
Can we get this to 96 Million views
Why didnt they add 4 million more
If I get 10k likes + pinned I'll say what everyone didn't have the balls to say.
Ayo the title is a bit sus
BALLZ LMAO
Pretty sus title ngl
The manufacturing of the balls is wasteful and this can't be practical in a wider application.
"_last for at least 10 years_
quick fix, treat the symptom not the cure, society"
niceeeee
"Close
 views/balls"
4:38 we have to remove sunlight... If you have too much sun on too much surface.... How about solar panels ? Two birds with one stone
Why didnt they just cover the whole area with solar cells? Then you get drinking water and carbon free electricity. Now you have a recipe for disaster if theres something unforseen you didnt expect to happen.
Mysterious ...
"The question is, what r they made of ??!!"
Just barely before 96 million views!
almost 96000000 views
how many black people had to die?
"there's only 1 problem, everyone knows that everything that is painted black and placed in the sun absorbs 85% more heat than something painted white or metallic (chrome) that repels 99% of the heat. this will only heat the water super fast and make the evaporation accelerate more. TRY IT WITH WHITE BALLS OR METALLIC CHROME. THIS TEST WAS MADE HERE IN BRAZIL AND IT WAS 1 SUCCESS."
putting plastic in a lake is pollution
"96,000,000 balls approaching 96,000,000 views"
"nope still 93 mil

 mil"
5:50 someone see the Bird gone in plane engine
bro playing gta 5 irl
I have to pour one out for that bird 5:52.
Real reason probably birds :)
It awsan't cancergenic enough so they used that crap to make sure microplastic will cause the cancer ^^'
You should have tried walking on it
Soon there will me as many views as shade balls in the water
Why not covering it with floating solar panels?
now I wanna see the collect them back......
Being half filled with water the 96 million balls are a water reserve of their own.
"Wait, you can eat them? DEW IT!"
What happens to a person if they fall in the water?   Off the boat for instance.
You know they cause cancer lmao
I'll revisit when the views hit 96M
Whats crazy is this video is 3mil more clos3r to 96million views
And now imagine that every single ball stands for one dead person. Thats is roughly how many people died in WWII. Not a nice thing to think about but it makes the scale more imaginable
this how big the ball pits used to look like when you were 5
stop algae blooms
not started the video yet but I think its for blocking the sun light ? maybe ?
Very interesting! Are the balls still there today?
The balls are there to make the water evaporate and also to poison the water
STUPID IDEA WILL HEAT UP THE WATER AND KILL THE FISH IN THE WATER HUMANS NEED TO GROW UP STOP ACTING LIKE SPOILED CHILDREN
So microplastics are in the end bad so this is bad right ?
My balls are always throwing shade.
48 million black man
"The thing that surprised me most is that, they filter the water. Then they test the water. Then it goes into the reservoir. Then they apparently don't test the water at all at any other point in the process. To the point that they had no idea they were sending out literal cancer water for people to drink until a consumer told them they were. How have they not been subject to a lawsuit or some manner of concequence over this absurd lack of oversight?"
300 blak balls for only 2 pounds
For a Moment i thought It was Gino d'acampo
Kim Kardashian must never learn of this.
"96,000,000 million balls 93m views!!!"
93 million views... come on just 3 million views
thats like 48 million men in just one reservoir right there
i clicked on this video in expectation of something else
almost 96 mln views for 96 mln balls
When your tax money goes to something useful
share with me again 100 years later
it was so sad to see the bird get shredded by the plane :(
This looks like a no man's sky textured planet
"To be honest, it's absolutely stupid to test the quality of water at the exit of the filtration and not at the exit of the reservoir... Especially an open air one..."
"If I jump in then there's gonna be 96,000,002 black balls"
Why are 93M views on this video?
"Next up:
Microplastics, why are they suddely everywhere?
$cientists baffled"
"I don't understand.

Back here at Calcutta something called the Tala tank ( a huge overhead tank) works fine to serve water to millions of people every day.

Why do you need an entire reservoir with balls floating on it"
Can you throw a party when this hits 96 million views?
That's what she said?
Reminds me of Gantz
And yet my ex-wife experienced more black balls
Gee that's not a shitheap of plastic pollution.
I feel like this incredibly important to terraforming.
why can't they just make a pipe line across the reservoir?
Would this work to keep above ground pool from losing heat and evaporation and stop The growth of algae in the water
Say hello to mico-plastic contamination.
Thats a lot of ball
Look at all those BLACK BALLS!
I love black balls now.
And no thoughts were given to the leaching of chemicals into the water. Bozos
whats crazy is 93 million people watched this. you - the person reading this - is almost one of those balls. looking at the balls gives a great visuallization of 93 million people and that blows my mind.
I don't see my balls
The COO is gonna get played by Christian Bale in the reservoir movie.
ayo pause 1:48 what did he sayyy
This video nearly has the same amount of views as there are balls in the reservoir.
I'm looking forward to 96 millions views on this video!
Hope this video reaches 96M views
Microplast desolved by UV heating inzo water will cause great ...to nature and our health
Can you walk over that?
"Come-on guys we're almost at 96,000,000 views! This would make my monkey brain happy"
My concern is some California weirdo dumping a dead body in there.
Lets make this video views to 96 million.
kudos to the 48 million black men standing in the reservoir
"What about microplastic water pollution? With time, plastic exposed to sunlight radiation will start to degrade, crack and release microplastics to the water. What is the lifespan of these PVC balls? How often do you monitor water for microplastics? This can be a serious issue..."
Nigga balls
"Who else found this by searching ""nigga balls""?"
Why not have an underground reservoir?  way better. The workers seem to lack basic chemistry knowledge claiming the didn't realize chlorine and bromine would react? Adding plastic to the water is what the rest of the world is trying to clean up due to many hormone altering chemicals leaching out as the plastic breaks down from the sun. I'm glad for many reasons I do not live in LA this is stupid.
0:31 when you realise that the veiws of video are equal to balls
"Views for this video are about to touch 96,000,000 soon 0:38"
I wish I had black balls
"The question is not why balls, but why black?"
"Walter from plastic bottels have a lot od plastic, but from plastic bals and temperature is safe.. Nice."
Awesome.     @Omnichanelfun
5:52 did that bird get sucked into the plane engine? Ouch
Imagine a wave generator in this lake.
Instead of black it would be great to use white
"With markets tumbling, inflation soaring, the fed imposing large interest- rate hike, while treasury yields are raising rapidly _ which means more red inks for portfolios this quarter. How can I profit from the current volatile markets. I'm still at a crossroads deciding if to liquidate my $125,000 bond /stock portfolio"
96 million black balls and almost 96 million views. Let's push through the final stretch!
That's a lot of balls to take in
96 Million views.....not a Million likes!!!!   And someone like me_doesn't even listen to the man and came here in comment section. Thank you myself for wasting time.
Cuz black people can't swim
That's excellent.
It's almost one ball per one viewer!
Somehow still less than the amount of balls your mother had on her forehead last night
.
All they need to do now is pour balls in the ocean
Does that mean you're f#*-d if you live elsewhere and drink tap water??
big black n***a balls hd
$32M or so cost
The real question is how he recorded this without laughing.
Please answer this @veritasium
"Black is heat friendly and it will absorb  the heat very quickly,  but why did they use black??  Rather they can use white balls instead. White is a heat reflectant colour..It reflects the heat."
What it looks like when you dive under the balls???
Should have been white - Basic Physics
Why black over white balls? Doesnt black attract the sunlight?
"As much as people complain about the government and chant ""f*** the system"", I'd venture to guess that those people also don't understand all of the things like this that go on behind the scenes and protect them. That of course doesn't mean that we should just blindly trust the system, but it does make me appreciate some scientists within the system that may have gone unnoticed in history. Big thanks to you guys, whoever you may be. Also, phone most of us I thought chemistry, I feel what should be added to what is taught in schools are actual practical, real life questions for application like: what does the water I drink come from? What is cancer?"
you nearly have as many views as shade balls
How do they take them out of the reservoir when their 10 year shelf life expires?
Is this really cost effective to put balls in a reservoir for health reasons for plastic isn't safe either?
Because all the white ones were racist
its actually called bro-mate LOL
Road to 96 million views
There's almost a view for each ball now
STOP SAYING -BUNIND- IMMEDIATELY
White balls would work better at reflecting heat/ sun shine
", just simply create lands and grow paddy fields. It stores tons and tons of water!... Simple right? By this way 1 acre of land may store minimum 1000 tons of water without evaporation."
"it's fascinating how Americans can sell anything to their people. If even a local politician proposes that in France, everyone asks for his resignation for ecocide XD"
"Use solar panel,"
did anyone noticed the bird incident at 5:52
"93 million so far, waiting for 96 million."
Is it only last 10 years? How are they going to cycle through all of them?
"So there is was absolutely no wild life inside the reservior at all? Which would start dying out due to lack of sunlight and decay in the water? I mean you already told that this detered surface wild life like birds and animals to come to the reservior, which is pretty bad for them, but it would be more devastating to life with in the water."
Your mum's had more
"if the balls were white, it be racist"
This video almost has the same number of views as balls in that river.
this guy explaining the balls has the same energy when you study a lot about a specific random topic and then once in your life you get the opportunity to explain it to someone
They contaminate the water
"Derick, what about the marine life in the water? Like the fish and grass."
idk ask kanye
Soon more views than balls.
"So if it weren't for a water company this would have been missed,. I still don't get where white balls wouldn't reflect heat, and balls from plastic woodshed, or even abrade microplastics into the water ( wind was mentioned). If it's a California idea it just can't be good."
I would never have the balls to do this
"I suspect that they are in fact to reduce evaporation and they are black because algae doesn't grow on black plastic very well.
The story is coded and contains mockery.
Proof of all claims are required."
"0:33 ""96 million SHADE balls"""
big black balls
Plastic is great for water. Trust me. P
"I know there's a joke here
I cant figure it out"
Bollocks
"should've made them white instead, reflect the sun instead of heating up and warming the water."
The Kardashians would have a field date watching this video
No wonder why I hate humans
Bu nedir
Kim kardashian would love this
"Very interesting, very informative!"
We're 4M views away from reaching 96M views.
In a word....heat!
I'm like BrO
so before this everyone was drinking carcinogenic water?
DWP oughta sell singles of the balls in the gift shop like mickey hats
Looks like a reservoir filled with caviar
This is stupid this might be due to the storms
What a waist of time and money. What is its benefit?
"""I had so many questions, like why are they black?"""
Nice to see you are using a gas engine in the drinking water
"One day....
number of balls = number of views"
"Legends call it, The Kardashian Reservoir."
We're having a plastic problem so California adds to existing problem
"Let's take this video, each ball should get views."
Probably one of the stupidest ideas to come out of our city government.
"Veritasium black balls 
Haha"
Fake number of balls
California is one of the stupidest places on earth.
Very sus ... so many of them and bloodlines ::)
"""Why are there 96,000,000 black balls on this reservoir? I don't know."" [video ends]"
"6:04 dude, they are sure happy after displacing those innocent birds from their habitat!"
thats a lot of strong balls
Yeah any bromate I've ever met was definitely cancer
"@5:51 Bruh, that plane sucked that bird right in! RIP"
96 million black balls and 92 million likes
they should be white so the balls reflect sunlight and don't heat up
Have they created any kind of alternative arrangement for the birds who used to drink the water from the reservoir.
Yo Mr. White
Yeah but How do you keep Bouncy-House Addicted Toddlers out of the Reservoir?
I'm surprised there's no comment here about Mr incredible boobytrap
I would not drink that water bro.
So we just gonna ingnore the bird getting desentegrated by the plane
96 millions Nigga balls
Holy balls!
"i cant watch this video without hearing a vine boom after every time he says ""balls"""
"So, they paid $ 32.000.000 for these balls. OoO"
"Ok but why in black? It would be better if the balls were white, right? because black absorbs heat and white reflects it. As well as the roads the roofs etc etc... Thanks"
4 million views missing
"Seems like a great product. Awesome scenery as well. But somehow the people on the boat appeared high to me

Ya by now those balls are breaking down in the sun and contaminating the water. Did you consider how to remove the balls. Without the sun the water will not get the uv to cleanse the water. This is as stupid as jogging in place.
we are nearly at 96 million views
Are these balls plastics?   If so it can be a health hazard to drink these water.

why are they black? BECAUSE BLACK IS BEAUTY MY NIGGA
Duh why would you think evaporation would be a issue? Common sense alone would lead to less but actually knowing why and how evaporation happens you clearly see why the balls help. Yes the balls get hot but they're sitting on water which is great at heat transfer and storing energy
I'm suddenly feeling down knowing my balls aren't even worth a $

"Bromine compounds like bromide are _not_ harmless. They disrupt the endocrine system by competing against iodine absoprtion, same as fluorine compounds like fluoride. Combined with many other sources of endocrine disruption in the modern environment, this is especially a risk for developing children.

Chlorine, also a halogen, is different because it evaporates so rapidly- and unlike fluoride has a measurable public health benefit, perhaps one of the largest single benefits ever. Reverse osmosis filter your drinking water."

"i thought they were used to reduce algae, because it can form in large, mostly still bodies of water when exposed to sunlight. algae, despite filters catching some, can thrive almost anywhere, and if you use algacide, you cant really drink the water. if there are lots of little things that absorb most of the sunlight and moves the water, you cant really get algae. interesting video though!"
That is a lot of big black balls!
How do you take 96 Millions black balls off?
There are almost as many balls in that reservoir as their are views on this video

If the water doesn't evoparate how do you get the rain? Is the water you preserve through this method will make you sustain throughout the year? Leave the natural process as is and learn to live with sustainable things that are available without any struggles. Right or wrong?
Imagine falling in the water. You couldn't swim.

"Uh few questions. 
Why not create a shade for the whole reservoir or simply enclose it? Is it not much more efficient?
Assuming you didn't do that to receive benefits of the effects from the sun or the open environment, wouldn't the creation of shade balls eliminate those purposes?"
Now I know why my shade ball I use in my backyard gone
Bruh
Those sure are some round balls
So why again didn't they use white balls to absorb less heat ?

"What do you think happens when you take 96 million HDPE plastic balls and put them on water, where they can float around and rub against each other, when that water is a reservoir used to provide tap water to homes? I heard you had a microplastic problem. 

Sure, I get it, it's to stop sunlight from reacting with bromide in the water and creating bromate, but one might think that there are other ways to deal with that. Activated carbon filters for example, (you should probably have one anyway), or maybe just figuring out why there's bromide in the water and removing it. Pesticides for California Strawberries, or other sources.

Also, Ozonating water does the same thing as sunlight, but perhaps more effectively, and that's a relatively common method of decontaminating water, particularly bottled water."
