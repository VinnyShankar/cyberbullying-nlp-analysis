Hi
Bull shit from UK :)
What sort of licence do you need as that exceeds 3.5 tonnes? Do you need a C1 or C?
2023
That LittleBigPlanet music at 3:56 mmm
Marauder insane armoured vehicle nicy
"100%, the indestructible marauder military 50 ton vehicle"
"Best episode ever. I think I've seen this 5 times now, still laughing my ass off watching it."
They used chuck norris blood to paint the marauder.
"my first 300k is going straight to one of these puppies
for the everyday stuff of course."
Red that im still researching love
Still waiting on my from Germany
Dr disrespect should own it
"Hummer, in fact, is not dead anymore."
mr beast fans believe he creates car explodes !!! LOL
What an ugly piece of metall on wheels.
We not gonna talk about the 14 pounds of plastic explosives they have
Where do you buy that I want one
If it only was a bit quicker
Best car for a zombie apocalypse
best city car ever....
Rounded gutters
Door steps
Watching
This car is racist
I need that car
I prefer Giorgio Moroder over Marauder
So this was supposed to be delivered to Bruce Wayne.
The H3 is - of course -  no comparison
"After watching last part of granade, it's definitely a better choice than Rolls Royce..."

Marauder actually allowed Top Gear to blow up the car?! Wow. Talk about Marketing
smallest american suburban family vehicle
"If a Zombie Outbreak happens on earth, I will look for you to ask where this car is parked .."
The fact it survived that explosion is actually really impressive.
"The kind of car Americans claim to need for ""hauling"" groceries"
"i've always wanted to go van living for at least a few weeks, but i'm too much of a coward as i'm too paranoid someone will break in, kidnap or kill me in my sleep. if i had this bad boy, i'd feel so safe and at peace, i wouldn't have a single worry in the world lol. man i want one so bad."
Everyone has a richard hammond in their head that gives them the most Horrible ideas known to man
4:12 The Alfa Romeo and the 1999 Renault Megane didn't deserve that
Ngl but hammonds face looks like noah schnapp a lil bit
nice car
6:46 the irony of Hummer having the EV now
The hummer H2 and h3 are all gm designed and have nothing to do with the military grade humvee.
The production cost of this video must have been insane
"They do a background check so they can be sure you're not a villain..
I guess they are'nt really good at their job they gave that thing to Richard Hammond"
This would really help for my daily trips to the minefields with my family!
That's a big truck
Dear Santa...
I wish mine was that big
Keren
Little big planet music????
i love british sense of humour

Being an useful machine for rid of the problem in parking and traffic. This would surely be a solution of those who think as i

So FUNNY!!"
What in the gta
This is just a normal American car in 2023.
"If you could put 7 LBS (3 KG)of C4 under neath any car, what would it be?"
Hammond the hamster .... Couldn't even beat the land speed record ...failure driven English embarrassment ...why do we tolerate big mouths like him and Clarkson ?
The New Batmobile?
the marauder asks terms and conditions to agree with it
The Rock has 1 of these!
I think some of the bits that this car did are illegal guys. Like taking up 2 spaces in a parkinglot.
mad max armored truck
Me in GTA
Good car for traffic

mec je te l'achete contre un malabar gout a laa fraise! (y'a le tatoo avec)

Final boss of arc complex is now a car
And then the rear shaft break kkkkkkkk
That one time when a bunch of dudes with short shorts made short shorts cool
"The way it dug itself out, in the scene after they tried to destroy it. Just amazing"
"Most 'super-cars' are just cars with an overpriced badge that can go really really fast but only legally on one road in the world or in LARPing race tracks.
THIS is an actual super-car."
there are infinite rules and regulation for these machines and testing them...but rules and regulations are not for the BRITISH!
"""This isn't a riot situation. Don't be alarmed"""
"we're going to have to tow you, sir
""i dont want to be towed""
but you're not supposed to park here, we have to tow you
""you said *i* can tow *you?* okay""

""i want to park here""
you cant, we're already parked there
""i said i want to park here."""
Need some of these right now in Ukraine.
4:11 poor Alfa Romeo 166

I'd settle for a M-35A2 bobbed deuce at a fraction of the price
I want her how can we get the same
"it's probably a fuel drinking beast, but a beast it is indeed :D"
only 290hp?
4:16 he's a menace
thats not top gear but just true top G
"Yes sure it's expensive and not ""fancy"" by ordinary fashion, but being mine-protected, able to have several tons extra in payload (cargo and people), and an ability to withstand standard 7.62mm armour-piercing tungsten-core bullets firing at the vehicles armour from 30 meters away? that is at least something a Rolls Royce can't compete with."
it looks like a hummer h3 fell into a tub of protein
What if someone left their baby in that car he destroyed.
"LMAO..
 makes the Hummer seem small"
Amazing truck i hope there could be some in my country p.n.g
Change d tires u wud pull it alone
HAMMOOOOND !!! YOU STOLE 14 POUNDS OF PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE YOU PILLOK
90 mm thick glass? thats the armor heavy *tanks* used in ww2
every young boy dream
I'd take this over a boring Rolls Royce any day of the year
Al i was thinking about is GTA V...
GTA online be like:
Wow its still driving after the bomb. Die you noticed the bomb under the hummer was under the engine. The bomb under marauder was under the back. I cant watch stupid things from stupid people..
I refuse to believe anything here is staged
"How does that car not have run flat tires on it, for a vehicle built for these situations they forgot one crucial thing"
"I absolutely hate running over plastic explosives and land mines, so I might consider getting this car!"
"Pros:
 - no issues with traffic
 - never get parked in
 - offroad capable
 - can't get pulled by the rozzers
 - survives explosives
Cons:
 - drive through only for small portions
 - windscreen wipers not lion proof"
pretty sure nokia was involved in some way
"Wow, i watched it first 11 years ago when this video came out, at that time i just enjoyed the car and what it can do, seeing this now makes me realize how much money and effort was put at that time into making this video. This video alone must cost over a million dollars."
Why dose ut look like a insurgent from the video game grand theft auto online and for the people who play gta online it looks like a insurgent mk2
Ki koka kastravec totall budoll
Ideal family car for holiday in iraq
These were part of Mariopol liberation
Not worrying about hitting anything is the zenith of luxury.
I would like one for my birthday.
How big was this show's budget?
"Can't believe they let them blow up a 300,000 dollar vehicle. No wonder the show was canceled they went broke lol"
"52.5 MILLION VIEWS HOMEBOY COULD AFFORD TO BUY 5 OR 6 OF THESE THINGS,"
I like that armored vehicle.
4:27 thats my dream on what to do when someone pissing me off on the road
Amazing
Ay ay mate.
Safety needed in South Africa
The perfect car for Brazilian roads!
Lovely
3:32 Uno reverse at its finest.
DAM THIS VECHICLE IS POWERFULL 3:30
I think that we can all agree that the Marauder is second only to the Toyota Hilux.
I think this is good for Los Angeles streets because of the hood is it?
I want one. Only for the parking features
Imagine your Uber driver pulling up in one of these.
"Is this Africa, G-B or slumland?"
Best vehicle for zombie apocalypse.
This looks like a villan car in a cartoon
"300k euro : Rp. 4.996.375.461 trillion .
Cukup buat nyekolahin orang 1 provinsi sampai D3. Atau buat bagi BLT 300k an XD"
Any  cargo truck can do this
"Did the ak 47 come with the maurader
Or does Hammon now own ak 47s"
Can It Be Duramax Swapped
Betty Crocker designed a great vehicle! Wow right on

Rocket league
"""The wood might clash with the wood on the machine guns.""
* Points To Semi-Automatic Rifle *"
*You were never one of us.*
I like where after the explosion all animals kinda freaked out
POWER!!!
Smallest American car
This isn't a comedy sketch but an advertisement for the sort of people that would buy this monstrosity. I want to live in a country where a civilian doesn't need this vehicle.
If someone tries to pull you over YOU TOW THEM OVER
"2:28, I love how that man looks over his shoulder _after_ the Marauder has smashed through and gone, he thinks all that happened is that the wall collapsed"
Jeff. From The Cycle: Frontier
"7:34 that is so clearly edited to add suspense, I love this show ahahaha"
You didn't blow up a real hummer. The H1 was the real hummer the h2 and h3 are a joke.
Surprised the car wasn't stolen
Cool
Why not get a 12 ton humvee
"You can put him out of action with a hand grenade, really badly designed, the chassis is a good target"
lol once upon a time it was a hummer 3 XD
The H2 may be destroyed by the plastic explosive but at least you can get  MacDonald's
Did he just actually crush two citizens car or is it planned
Ideal car for paris and another cities around the world
I wanted the stig to take it for a power lap when this episode aired.
Anyone knows the name of that music when he was driving that through that construction site?
"Finally, a perfect car for a pacific ride in Brazil."
This would make driving in Florida way easier
he shouldve driven the tow truck into an abandoned building or a shallow stream
The only appropriate vehicle for a white man in south Africa
"Me: *trying to watch top gear clips in peace*

The music at 3:49 making me miss playing LittleBigPlanet with my friends:"
The best daily driver for Bulgarian roads!
"1:14  '' The Marauder does compensate in other areas ''

Pretty sure all the Marauder does is compensate other areas."
Blonde moms:that look extremly impractical.. i need two
In America you get towed in Soviet Russia you tow tow
Just call it America's 2nd Amendment
4:12 Holy mother god!
I remember watching this online back in my school days. Good old times

"""Arnold Schwarzenegger Sent you a friend request"""
"hammond ""oh no is that gap big enough"" BANG!!! ""oh well it is now"""

"If I ever win the lottery, I am going to buy one if these!"
Jy Praat Afrikaans
Checkout Kalyani M4 too
4:18
"I am not interested in cars, but after watching this I am a super fan of Combat Cars."
You need one of these wherever blacks live.

This is such a tall vehicle and it's taller then the cars

"When is Top Gear coming to Johannesburg again to do another proper car test?  You will have to bring something tougher than a Marauder, the roads have a lot more potholes now."
I need in Pakistan way becos dam traffic in Karachi
"Today i was driving and i've gone through an incident that made me furious because of a taxi drive who thought that he was so fast that he could have passed me before his lane gets merged with mine.. that he even blew his horn on me which triggered, now i'm back here again to make some wishes!"
This is my favourite colour
its actually kind of cool to see that the bombs energy had to go somewhere so it just dug a big hole
"if there is zombies, i would like to pick this car to survive"
The only vehicle to drive in South Africa

"Peruk is y profile image of go ,,)))"
1:09 - Always annoying when that happens.
Gas prices. Am I right

Top Gear reviews a military wrecking machine. Of course they gave it to the American.

What are you gonna do use an RPG and explode it
The marauders weakness is visiting a safari park and a lion attacks it
Well crashing into the wall with the marauder military vehicle is vandalism
the poor tow guys had no clue what was going on.

Feel sad for the car
Cool.
Wall breaker

"I come back to this video evey year to re watch it, this will one day be my truck for well.. things lol"
Top of the top
Imagine the look on those peoples faces when a massive armored truck bursts through the wall
That's where the tax money goes
Yo it has a tractor tranny and driveshaft thats pretty dope ngl

I wonder if they sell to the cartels
Very cool! I want one!

This is only 5 tons high compression vehicle with off road specialist
"My dream car, still."
"Hmmm..... Buy a Marauder for 300,000 or a Scorpion IFV for 20,000? I think I'll take the Scorpion. Hell, you can even buy old soviet design tanks for a fraction of the cost of a Marauder. T-54/55s going for 20,000-30,000 and T-72s going for 35,000-50,000."
"7:40 it seems to now be front wheel drive only, id say that is a tad more than an inconvenience."
Is there any chance I can drive it for Pizza Hut for deliveries
so many good things wasted to make a sub  par short video inside a super poor country. Sad and evil.
The back right wheel actually comes off the rim at the end but the dirt cloud covers it up. Surprised I didn't see any comments about that. Even so the big bastard took a couple pounds of high explosive and drove off. Makes ya feel better for our soldiers who've gotta drive these beasts into combat.
Oops. Forgot we had a baby in one of those cars.
Paint it black and it makes for the perfect personal batmobile.
Heard its coming to say hi to russkies in ukraine!
Look at the tow people face
I. WANT. ONE.
It just needs better wipers! If that is fixed I would immediately get one of these.
Inmortal hilux vs Marauder
Dominic torreto wants to know your location
that cars grip is really good
What he fails to mention is that the red version is 3x faster than the other colors.
"Windows where the passengers heads are VERY CLEVER , just one head shot."
i think i want this
Normal GTA day xD
Finally a car worthy of protecting me from griefers
This tank going 70mpg and you getting into an accident with this. You are dead.
this 8 minute bit cost at least half a million bucks
4:11 What you see when you tap on Ukraine in snap maps
I Iike is car
Wowowwowoowowowoowowowowowoow
top gear or top war ? that was great episode
Rr ne vas
"Please tell me there's an updated version of this truck
This would be a dream car if it was electric and didn't guzzle half a dinosaur whenever you wanted to pop to the shops"
6:21.. the Hummer didn't deserve it..nOO.... It's sad and pathetic..
So it's cool to do this in Africa?
I wish I had the money to blow up hundreds of thousands of dollars.
"Imma save up for about 20 years, I want this baby"
It's built using parts of nokia 3310.
Well you need the money to pay off people insurance or they wear props 4:11
"What was the marketing & production budget for this video, everything obviously is clearly staged....but nice advertising for the company"
"Lol this is awesome, I want one"
Great for 2020s collapse
"3:31 ""Your vehicle is being towed""
""No U""

600k isn't bad for piece of equipment like that
Very Desnecessary
Hey Steven Daniel we need a car like this lol

I would live to pick people up through Uber with this to see their reactions.
Can I say that this is my dream car?
Much like the products from Terradyne... except I like the way Terradyne designs their vehicles... a bit better for daily driving.
this the truck off dead rising 2
Pretty ballsy driving that around South Africa.. A lot of the gangs see these types of vehicles as a target because it means you are protecting something valuable.
All the dudes he passes look lime they need some spare change
"A thumbs up to you for destroying 3- 4 cars, blasting, wild safari,McDonald's fence destroyed, police truck stolen, breaking some houses, breaking through one big wall, crusing through traffic, flattening own tyres for a fantastic video."
0:56 don't give is these ideas!!
I love how they just blew up a 300k car...
Okokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokopkokopko
I wanted him to change out the tire
It's always cool to see things that make it easier to kill people! WOOT!! KILL KILL KILL!!
Yooo I got one of these on GTA V
HAMER III FOR LUMPMEN
The advertisement is astonishingly good. People in the video would often mistake it for a rich thug doing some reckless thing. Nice one. You have my respect.
"It's funny to come back here and see Richard Hammond was so ""young""."
Boi do I wonder what all the dmg cost is
Was this some sort of show based on the fact that he drove off
"4:13 Bruh, why?"
He crushed two cars
You really have a lot of money to waste
if you drive that you will become a walking target once you get off the car in south africa
*crazy tv show i ever see* ....blow up a hammer just to compare
Now that's a camping vehicle!
Everything he's done would send you to jail.
This vehicle is for PPL with tiny peepee  and XL ego.
R.I.P.EXE (  3:30  )
Bro....he's had ak-47 machine gun.....
Perfect for zombie apocalypse
Wouldn't drive that thing through Ukraine.
what a monster
This is what i need for those idiots at work
"Yup, it was staged. But despite its size, if you look at the glass, it is very thin and wont compete with an Oskosh, Ejder Yalcin and other MRAP type vehicles."
4:35 that woman's face as she comes on scene late.
Konkurs are waiting for them :))) Welcome to Donbass :)))
Es un marauder
Is this a good alternative to the tank? Maybe some modifications can help military
Just awesome! I want one..
How did this guy earn the privilage to drive all these vechiles?!
Anybody have any idea what the sound effect at 4:31- 4:32 is called
just a normal day in gtav online
"Mechanic: Okay your car is all good now, we hope you have a nice day. 

Credit Card: *Declines*

Mechanic: 4:10"
It looks like a 'murderer' to me..
2022 still waiting for the update version
4:11 Can't Get You Out of My Head but you're having a coffee in Johannesburg.
"Love the marauder 
Love Hammond 
And I love that they used Kylie Minogue's music!"
Russian military cars are better
"7:04
So that is how *her* survived *that.*"
"Nice car to become a camper for hippies and reavers for the upcoming podt-apocalyptic
world."
Just need a nice ma deuce mounted on the top and I'm in
"Yah, it is a good shopping vehicle."
It is not a sharing karr.
No it's not
Not a single brake checker in sight
Huge car small you know
"At 1:14 the camera shutter speed matches the wheel rotation, makes it look like a poorly rendered videogame hehehe"
At least you can't die in collision.
"3:43 , it isvery rude and demeaning to make fun of administrative and civic bodies of other countries. Go ahead and do this with metropolitan Police authorities in public streets of London. South Africa should have admonished your production team for such impudence.
But I like the overall video other than this part."
Welp if they used a milspec hummer it would have survived as well
"i'll be sure to try everything you did in the video

when i buy one"
ak's are not machine guns
By pressing 3 or 8 you'll get the two top gear moments of the video
It coming with missiles?
10 years on and this would easily be the vehicle of choice in a post-covid apocalypse. They knew what they were really building this for back then
It just passed where i live in Johannesburg
I want one.
That's a bad ass truck
"Someone tell us how much USD, 300,000 pounds is"

Looks like an MRAP.
"Hammond: oh nooo my marauder get towed!
Hammond: anyway, do you want to play tug of war?"
wait thats a vehicle model from  rocket league!
4:10 gives you an idea of just how heavy it is!!
Was their budget a million per episode or something?
One ugly looking vehicle.
"""DONT BE ALARMED IM NOT SHOOTING"""
I like how well the bright red armoured car blends in with it's surroundings
With this car you have no problem finding a parking space
"For a video posted 10 years ago, I'm surprised its in 1080p"
"That has to be the coolest vehicle on the planet, this is what Hummers want to grow up to be, I could go on but I'd have to revert back to Monty Python in my shit was tougher than yours sketch."
i like how you dont baby it lol.
Hammond would need a Stannah Stairlift to get in it.
So this is what it looks like to NPCs when I drive around in GTA V
You never know people supporting NRA in States would love to rent this as wedding car or limo
Give it to whistlindiesel if you want a real test.
"When that Hummer got blown to bits, it's like: ""What did I do to deserve this?""
The Marauder when it feels the explosives: ""WAS THAT MOSQUITO?"""
a Brit riding a tank now makes alot of sense to me...
Otter
Odd ear
I'd have a lot more fun in that than the Rolls.
The H3 was always a piece of shit!
they changed the thumbnail  . the old thumbnail was  a sign to  the power of  the marauder
love how they used a hummer H3 for comparison when that's basically just a small family car
what a useless piece of nothing
"Oh my God. They played ""Left Bank Two"" for anyone who isn't aware, that song was used ironically in Little Big Planet."
They changed the thumbnail huh. The old one was sick
They changed the thumbnail
The endcard looks super stupid
These top gear guys are so funny and nuts

Volvo's new city car looks great.
"Enemy soliders: *watches video to find it's weakness*

Leader: so what's it's weakness?

Soliders: bad windshield wipers"
How did they convince someone to let them plant 7lbs of explosive under their 300k car? Gotta be staged somehow at the end there
:)
i see you have gunAND MY FATHEER IS  A POLICE
I can think of a lot dumber things to spend 300k on - like a Lambo or something.
"This show sucks in hindsight. In the day, I loved it. Probably good for 8 year olds now."
"i like hwo they blew udner the hyummers engine, but udner the very most rear towbar at the veeery end of the big boi...."

Hate wheel drive!
Batman should have this
"The troubled chime similarly expect because planet approximately cross behind a jumbled move. statuesque, fearful fearless development"
Best video ever.
Is this legal doing all of this? When being getting towed get revenge
"Fun fact: you could but a TANK for 30,000 pounds"
Want
I think the Marauder would be useful for ukrainian military right now.
Oh old friend the Hummer. Bang!!
what a lovley looking hum-
"Hammond in demolition: ""I've scratched me tank.""

Hammon in marauder 07:37: ""That was definitely an inconvenience."""

Mending mobilnya buat saya daripada di rusak seperti itu
"Lol he says no one would rent it for a wedding car, you kidding, that's the car I'm renting for wedding"
Found my new daily vehicle
It has power operated doors just like a Rolls Royce Phantom
i love how hammond just doesnt give a crap about human thoughtsband just smashes through a wall and crushes two civilian cars.
Moms will take this thru the Starbuck's drive thru.
Hmm when the explosion finished a few parts are broken like the back bumper (or something else)and the tire isnt realy doing well
How much?
You know what this would make a perfect camper.
"""Oh, that gap's big enough!""
*crashes through wall*
""I-It is now."""
I am considering if I should invest in one as it might be useful in the current times we live...
And the flat tire ?
Gonk!
Truly badass
The budget for this episode would fund Canadian television for a year
what i'm most surprised by is that thing seemingly not being a 4x4
The JMPD chick's is like yoh yoh yoh.... if your South African you'll understand
10 years later.
amazed film
"Damn, 7 pounds of explosive and just a flat. That is an actual tank."
Wow
This is Afrika or UK?

I miss the days when the BBC has a sense of humor.
that's the most monstrous car I've seen.
I want one just because it looks cool and I know would it be wildly impractical.
An AlfaRomeo 156 was hurt in the making of this video.
"That piece of urban soccer mom  junk on wheels is not a ""hummer""."
I just wonder what was the budget of a single top gear episode
Imagine if Malcom Bricklin decided to market this to the US civilian market...
Oh just cute lady's shopping car
Why does Hammond seem to just have a little big planet soundtrack over his adventures? He had Atlas in another and now one before running over those car
Dwayne Johnson should have this recommended to him.
"""Military spec"" is often called, ""Military grade"" in the US. It's especially funny to anyone who has served knows that most things made for the military were made by the lowest bidder on the contract and often are total rubbish for daily use"
Rear drive shaft is gone
Need this to crush all the Pri-I on the road. This would genuinely make the world a better place.

Alfa Romeo 156
People in India know off-road with their Mahindra Thar
It's cool and all but it looks so outdated.  Like it was designed in the 60s and built in the 70s.  In the former USSR.
Most diffiently getting this
this guy going gta mode
is this what SUV owners think about their cars?
3 x crazyies car
In America they tow you but in Britain you tow them

"The tow dont tow car car tow you 





What ever that means"
"This is your reminder that Oliver is from Johannesburg, where Hammond crushed cars and smashed through walls in this behemoth."
After the explosion he's just so relaxed not knowing that he has a flat tire
Love from South Africa
I missed the days when top gear was my favourite show.
Long live the mighty RG-33 which kept me and my team safe on many deployments.
I like how they yse Little Big Planet music in the video :D
True
"description ""guys driving my dream car and blowing it up"""

"You do not tow the Marauder.
The Marauder tows you."
WOOW
Hummer overdosed on steriods
How much does this vehicle cost?
I want it
the sheer amount of paperwork needed to get all of this done
I want one!
That would be a pretty good grocery getter and a pretty good family car and it would be a pretty good delivery truck and a pretty good house end it would be a pretty good store like Walmart for example
The moter sounds like Orange  county fire departments fire trucks
"300000 pounds, well that's how much it weighs hammond"
Hammond is definitely an American in this thing.
The look of this car does not fit for the name Marauder
Top Gear really was the greatest show...
Perfect vehicle for road raging soccer moms
A car that has my name in it
"will the marauder survive an explotion?
super eazy, bairly an inconvinience."
This is the kind of vehicle I want to see as a transformer
I wish they got a view of the inside when they put aa bomb under it
Looks like an huge jeep
I am thoroughly impressed that this thing can achieve 70 miles per hour!
I want to see this in GTA V
He towed the tow truck

Any car can bust through FOAM BRICKS

Richard's style was really uncalled for
yo that a fricking hummer swat van
Little got damaged nothing else. Just move on..
Don't break the car
Yes but why oh why did you have to destroy an Alfa ?!? :-(

How can a tow truck even lift that thing
This video Is banned in 100000 months For destroy cars
"Police: I'm sorry sir, you and your car are coming with us
Hammond: I think you meant you're coming with us"
I dont know why i just have a feeling that this video is very illegal
Are you kidding me? This is the best wedding car
running over those double parked cars was very funny.

"I like this truck because it is large and fit many passengers and bulletproof so if ceimibals will try to gun you, they cannot kill you because you have protection from bulletproof materials. It is nnnow my dream truck even it is heavy but i have a dream engine, and that is the 15.7l R12 12 Rotor Rotary Engine frombMazda that will make it fast."
When you buy an Insurgent IRL from Watstock

"3:30, what an unusual sight. A truck towing a tow truck"
this would have been the proper vehicle to own in south africa right now
"Can confirm they did not use the same amount of explosive for the marauder, and even the type seems different."
Imagine you in *GTA*
This my favourite  video
Essentially an insurgent from gta5 in real life.

RIGHT.. but how can I  change the tires?
Legends say this guy is still running marauder with flat tyre
Can anyone tell me what's the car next to the Alfa Romeo that Hammond crushed?
Junk
how did it do in icy regions?
"Passed the not a villain background check: treespass private property, ram walls, park anywhere, tug police's service truck, demolish two parked car, mess at mc donald drive thru, detonate a H3"
"When this thing parked in a no parking area, it towed the tow truck

Wait..."
bruh you destroy a poor cvilian car
Noch besser ist es mit VW zum verschrotten.
It looks like if you took my 95 Jeep Cherokee and beefed it up
But can it float on water?
I want a marauder
The great idiots all time
Finally a car that even Richard Hammond cannot destroy.
i mean how much money do this guys have?
"""I would like a cheeseburger and some chips."" I'm glad I'm American bc I totally didn't think Lay's potato chips when he said that."

"""Take this annoying slow traffic that I'm stuck in now.

I think I'm just gonna drive right through it."""
Gta online Nightshark in real life
oversized verhicle for people wanting to compensate their lackings.
i expected the explosive to launch the truck onto a highrise
Sad that soilders lives arn't worth 300k.
"Well, if it did get stuck, you could always get it out with a Hilux."
"Hii, you wanna super slowmotion click the snail"
When its so dangerous in Southafrica that you need this thing to feel safe lol.
Can't wait to see this in the hands of women...
If they made this ev it would be the best apocalypse vehicle
"id like to se the Marauder driven in an italian city, and make the streets a bit wider"

That's a nightshark
Shame on you man

now we know what car can save you from a zombie apocalypse
That's so hummer 2 not the OG
The only thing that annoys me here is that they compared it to the hummer which was never meant to be an armored transport vehicle thus there comparison is invalid
Jesus Chris their budget is insane.
Is this in south africa
I have no words for this car
--- this car gives NCAP it's own 5 star rating
The tire was popped after sinking in the hold

"Hummer is for men , Marauder for legends"
Perfect for a zombie apocalypse
Sheeeeeeeeeeeh
Lottery winner: I would like to order 14 of these Military Vehicles
Also would like to see explosives set off under the driver side front / engine area simulating driving over an IED. Clearly was set off on the back end in this video to minimize damage done
That back passenger side tire looks kind of wobbly as he drives off I suspect it sustained significant damage
What episode is this

Marauder-and i took it personal."

No alfa Romeo 156 no
"He could've just opened the door, and then get the take out

But that would be boring"
