What song is this
"A Magician
An Author
A Panda
and most importantly the King of the Koopa, he's all of what I can list, I can guess that's why he's almost always either the main Antagonist/Protagonist."
I love jack black
"If an alien came and wanted to see earths master, we shall elect jack black"

A truly unique kids toy...not really but jack black shot the value up on these. I did a video if anyones curious...https://youtu.be/LhUNOOmNbfM
Skip the talkin and get to the rockin: 1:01
"Ohhhh,this gave me ""Peaches, Peaches, Peaches, Peaches, Peaches..."" energy LoL!"
OMG Jack Black makes me laugh so much
The man has no shame... and it is glorious!
I couldn't figure out why the music of the saxaboom kept playing in my head and why I found this so hilarious until tonight.... when I realized.... my adult son was also a master of this very same instrument.
that orchestra is crazy talented
"(My sister) ""How did this one man do all this magic?""
(Me) ""Because his bloody JACK BLACK!!!""
How did we manage to take all this talent?"
"Whoever made this wonderful, musical instrument needs to have a statue made to them."
"i love the part where Jack Black saids ""its Saxing time"""
So talented
"What's this I like the way he doesn't miss a single shot's he's doing great job collection and Lot's off the 
Improvment's by email including your current remuneration package quoting reference to the truck   h
Like there's programs are different to these football because like there's important thing made clear
Like there's programs are different to"
This is a perfect example of how instruments communicate to one another.
This man can make anything into a great song
his eyebrows make it so much funnier
He has to put this on his album someway or somehow I need it
I just watched an irl sample
Now i checked he has a role in Slys Demolition Man!!!
I had a lot of funny watching his amusing language skills and exceptional saxophone talent
I had a dentist drop filling pieces and I gagged a bunch.
God i hope he brings his saxaboom tonight im seejing tenacious d todayyyy
Hi Jack
I love this guy.
This continues to prove how much of a bad drummer that quest love truly is! He can just immense pickup on the song an drop an awesome beat!
U can see me putting this as my ringtone
"this video prove zodiac sign is a bunch of bull because this man is a virgo, the sign that is ""boring"""
That guy I listen to his music all the time it is my favorite. I like you so much whoever made this is the best. I love it.
1:36 When Bowser plays the Sax-A-Boom and the Koopas Rock Band join him
El nintendo jugar Mario
It's sounds like a payday 2 soundtrack
That was fake as fk just like him!!!
This dude is *cool*
I love this. I always come back to watch it.
"""Rare as a Stratovarius"" The way he just says that off-hand with absolutely no prompting or wind-up, then just moves straight on to his next bit. Jack Black is on another level comedy-wise."
Good times before saying the gamer word..
Man I love this man
1:02
Kdjxjdbfjche!
"Peaches, video games, then this. Absolutely a legend, Jack Black"
"Damn, Fallon is as fake as hell and Jack rocks!"

1:07 When Bowser wins the game.
Peaches

Peach
God I love him!!
Protect JB at ALL costs. What a gem
"Thats how a true comedian should be 
Always delivering  always funny even outside the job jack black isnt only a comedian but a very talented musician"
Boring. It's the same fucking tune every time. I expected more from jack. Sad
The guy who came up with those specific sounds for that toy must be smug as hell!
Sometimes I feel like a female jack black
"Ladies and gentlemen, Bowser"
This man is actually perfect
boom
I like how Jack's mood went when aware of the Sax-a-boom was like; 'You don't have a Sax-a- OH MY GOD! '
God he looks so young
Jack Black is a national treasure.
"This is hands down, my favorite episode of The Tonight Show!"
He always has something new to show
Whats the drummer name ?
It's  fun good job Jack Black
"Having heard this on several instruments, I could see this translated into a lot of brass band or high school band music."
"We will know how to escape and go out of this ever expanding universe, but will never know a way to cancel Jack. Bro is a gem found in trillions"
Love how Jack just wanted to chill and jam with the Roots and not lame ass Fallon.
E
You are my SaxABoom for a century
im so down today till I saw this :)
A National Treasure
As rare as a strativarius
1:10 1:18
"one two three four, one two three mother****** - I laughed so loud when Jack said that"
"This seems a bit staged, there's no way he didn't see that saxaboom laying there.  Still awesome though."
1:35 they understand the assignment
Zero music talent on saxaboom.( Tracks)
"A true throwback, when entertainers entertained."
Jack blacks in the Mario movie
One thing I never knew about Jack Black is that he had a beard.
Hey Angela good luck with your abortion

America
"I have two clips

Clip #1: 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 MOTHER F*CKER

Clip #2: 1 2 3 FOOOOOOUR"
"This is why Jack Black is absolutely the best large guy. He always puts his entire being into the character he's playing, and he's just generally amusing to be around"
2 years after the sax a boom the room erupts as loudly as it did in the concert in Tenacious D
PeachesPeachesPeaches
"1:36 I'm not even gonna lie, that goes hard"
I WANT ONE !!!
music to my ears
The low key hero of this jam is the drummer
this needs to be a full song
We don't deserve Jack Black
https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Black
"Forget guys like Bieber or Timberlake, forget guys like Mendes or sheeran, they are NOTHING compared to the sax-a-boom KING."
My favourite part XD 1:13
In my next life I would like him to be my best friend from elementary school til the end of my days!
"Great. I always wanted to start a new genre called ""Toy Metal"" or ""Jokercore"" metal and rock music made with toys instruments and naive lyrics."
The way his eyes bugged out when Jimmy handed him the thing... piercing and enthralled.
The way he starts grooving when the full sax-o-beat comes in (as hes standing next to the band) is perfection
We must protect him at all costs.
so that was Jack Black? I guess legends never die
"I start to knowing this legend in the new super mario bros movie, and now im starting to see him EVERYWHERE, LIKE WTH"
I love this type of insanity.
Bro... the steps at the very end. Lmmfao

The fucking meme
Jack Black- the man who can play a kids toy and get an entire room full of people vibing.
Literally the most charismatic guy alive. Nothing can change my mind.
Jack Black can be the Little mermaid if he wants and noone would be mad
i love this video
"truly a master, hes playing it without even blowing into it"
Now he has to play the world bowser theme from super Mario 3d world with the electric saxophone
i know this is like 4 yrs ago but this is fuking hilarious

One two three FOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOUR
Jack Black will never not be amazing.
The most amazing thing I have ever seen an actor do
PEACHES
You know it's fire when even the roots are jamming and vibing with you
"Legend has it, that this holds the Guinness book of world records for quickest hit ever created by man."
Someone NEEDS to remake this as an animation with Bowser! XD
1:34 - This song would certainly fill the dance floor.
1:12 3 Mother (beeb)
Jack Black can litterly play anything and make it sound good.
a true entertainer who wears regular clothes and loves his best life
"I used to play with that as a kid 

*90s kids ASSEMBLE*"
"1, 2, 3, 4 *tunes*

Best thing I've seen all week"
At 1:11 Jack Black said 1 2 3 motherfuker
Jack Black is the real life Joy Boy.
Imagine jack to be me and the saxaboom to be a hand shower. And now you know how I look like in the shower.

Jack black is the definition of putting all of your points in charisma
Jack black sweard

They feel so much less valuable when you realize the sounds are premade and you just click a button and the sound plays
The Best
peaches peaches peaches peaches peaches
Bowser playing the saxophone be like
"Jack black doesn't feel like a celebrity tbh, he just feels like a guy everyone happens to know and i love that!"
When the band comes in....
Java game ost be like:
"Skilled musicians are one of the coolest experts to see doing improvisation. One would start playing something and other will sync and start jamming, it's so awesome MmM"
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 MOTHER FU
"Funny:  A ""short"" YT vid on the front page of YT claims this is the worlds rarest instrument, and it is plastic injected molded in a high volume production shop. 
It did not grow on ""a"" tree.  :)"

Boa meu garoto

Bro when he said 1234 123 MF 1:09
This is the greatest thing ever!

"The song goes hard, but is nobody gonna talk about how Jimmy passed the vibe check?"
He became goku in 5 seconds
Now this is music.
1:41
"I know to people who know music this must seem silly, but the way those other musicians picked up and matched perfectly never ceases to amaze me :D"
"""Rare as a couple thousond dollar vintige violin"""
That was really tasty
Roots. How? So easily. How
Honestly The Roots Best Song:
Jack Black is a National Treasure!
Jack Black on Crack
Bowser is going places
"i checked ebay, 4 THOUSAND FOR AN UNOPENED SAXABOOM"
I believe that there is no way one cannot vibe to this. His vibe is contagious
"Family and friends aside, this man (Jack Black) is my favroite person on this planet. I can never NOT smile when I see him perform or interact with people. It may be weird, but his energy is almost therapeutic. He's just awesome."
FluminenC
"This clip is a personification of vibing. If anyone ever asks you what ""vibing"" means, you show them this clip of JB playing on Sax-A-Boom and then The Roots joining in. If they don't get it after witnessing this absolute masterpiece, they probably never will."
Jack black be like 1 2 3 4 1 2 3!! Mother fu@#er
Fallon tries to make everything look spontaneous and its pure cringe. Also Black is clearly not even playing it. 100% cringe clip.
"I love the ""3 MuthaF**ka"""
The people who laughed at stradivarius mustve had a violin or new the urban dictionary meaning
This has been in my head ALLLLL day! Lol
I just realized the guy talking to Jack Black is the Shazam actor
Jack black is the funniest and coolest dude I ever know
"Idek what a strsdavarius is 
But I love this!"
he turned into bowser now
Jack Black is a treasure and must be protected at all costs.
This is the same guy who taught kids that it's okay to form a school band and conceal it to your parents and teachers at the very end when you are about to enter a Battle of the Bands full of grown ups.
Nice
In a few seconds he made a better beat that so many singers today can't
GO BOWSER GO BOWSER GO BOWSER GO BOWSER GO BOWSER GO BOWSER GO BOWSER
Idk Why But It Sounds Like Payday 2 Music
Love how at the end the camera is kinda like 'back up dude'
"1,2,3,4 1,2,3 MOTHER*****ER"
The band completely understood the assignment 1:36
There is no way to hate Jack Black... He's a great guy!..
Musicians understood the assignment
I watch this clip when im feeling down. it cheers me up
Now you tell me after seeing this that it does not take years to master Sax-A-Boom

"Someone, please, I beg you, animate this as Bowser."
R.l. Stine
Aguante piches

He is the one who voiced Bowser in the Super Mario Movie
"Jack are the best human, who i know. hello from Kazkhstan"
Jack is great because in a world of ego celebritys it takes a guy who dosent take himself seriously to be a real star
"Just in this one moment, jack black and the roots have made a better song than most music now."
This is why I will forever love jack black 1:44
Back when late night shows were actually funny and entertaining too watch
Gotta love how the drummer just mixes himself in perfectly.
"So, about how much did these things retail for back when they were in production?"
"We don't need more cowbell, we need more JACK BLACK SAX-A-BOOM!"
Fallon is so fake. What a hack.

"This is what you need to know... The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life throught Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 6:23 God demonstrates his own love for us in this, while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Romans 5:8 Please believe and repent today"

"I can just imagine the band members coming home from work that day. Their wives asking how their day was and them just saying oh the usual, just jamming with jack black with a toy saxophone."
"What'S the drum play called at 1:40 . Sounds like action, maybe it's a name ?"
"no matter how old you are, you can still Busta move."
jack black is a God with that thing
"Jack black definitely gives off the vibe of that one weird and kinda eccentric kid in school, but is also very nice and fun to be around."
En un Futuro lo veo como un gran BOWSER en un PELI BIEN HECHA DE MARIO...
hry wasnt jimmy fallen on that jeffrey epstein private jet on his island?
BOWSER DONT NEED AUTOTUNE
Who else imagines Bowser playing this sax-a-boom after seeing the Mario Movie?
This guy is the cool kid at school.
I sincerely don't believe he was actually playing
Has anyone animated Bowser doing this yet
Why does Jimmy Fallon look like shazam and sounds line shazam
123 motherfucker and 1 2 3 FOUR always got my dying
Jack Black is the only person in the planet who can play a kid's toy and make it the performance of the century!
I want hear this in black hole
To be fair I think we know who he's playing the music for I think it's a princess but I can't remember her name

"Why doesn't everyone realise this was methodically practised again and again.....  not s second of this was done multiple times, including his response, standing up his line about the rareness... it was just an act. The band was waiting to be thrown in. All of it."
Help
I kinda want a School of Rock sequel with him and Kyle Gas.
Damn Jack Blacks got some crazy dance moves!
"Jack Black is a genius, masquerading as an idiot who is masquerading as a genius."
What kind of mixing movie magic was that lol somehow Jack's jam becomes magically looped and when all the roots start playing all I hear from them is the drums
PLEASE DONT LET THIS MAN DIEEEE
I need either an hour loop or a full version. FIGURE IT OUT
mortalkkkkombbbbbbbbbbbat

"I swear I need to watch School of Rock from beginning to end. I've seen bits and pieces of it. I've heard bits and pieces of Tenacious D music. Jack Black is talented, no doubt. And it shows how talented The Roots are as musicians improving."
"it all started as a saxophone toy... 
then in became a masterpiece."
Now imagine Bowser just does this in the Mario movie
Jack Black is pure silly goosery
Jack Black is an anime character who fell into the real world! Always ready to do the unexpected!
This is the best thing on the internet
"There's something about that ""1-2-3-FOUR!!!"" that sets my heart ablaze.  I love it."
"""As rare as a Stradivarius"" is no exaggeration when it comes to the Kawasaki Sax-A-Boom -- I just looked it up on a whim a minute ago, and it can go for as much as $5,000 on eBay alone."
Feels like none of them wanted to be the first to stop once they started... Video cuts out but I guess they're still going.
The band understood the assignment
SHAKE THAT MONEY MAKER!!!!!  LOLOLOL....
Only Jack Black. Ha! That looks like something Dr. Seuss would dream up.

Is no one gonna talk about how The Roots and Jack Black playing together just sounds like Daft Punk?
I used to have this toy. It was awesome.
That one was made for payday 2
"Jimmy Fallon ruined so many SNL skits. What a horrible comedian. At least he found a place to make money with writers that tell him what to do. He's no Johnny Carson for sure, but at least his idiocy is controlled here by writers."
"Bringing it back to the band: Very Jack Black,"
My man P.O.!

I watched the entirety of pick of destiny on YouTube in 9 minute segments about 12 years ago. Good Times

"Just to remind you people, this is the same guy who voices Bowser in the new Mario movie.

Let that sink in for a moment."
This is one of my favorite moments of Jack Black. I watch this a lot!!
Can't watch this without the Monster Hunter edit popping in my head
This guy is the chosen one Lol
I envy his family -- his kids are lucky to have such a crazy dad. Imagine having him wake you up for school like this.
Why is it so satisfying when the roots join in?
this is a MASTERPIECE
Jack Black is a treasure
Sax-A-Boom is an extremely difficult instrument to learn. I know how to play the saxophone but the sax-a-boom is way too hard.
Black thought is just having a great time man
Long Live Jack Black
"fuck black was off guts then ,,, i sorta thought he was weird until right now ,,, i was totally wrong he's a mega coke head  ,,,  i love him now hahhaha ,, the way forgot he was on the talkshow n just started coke ravin  was pricelesss ,,,    ill never forget this short clip thanks black that was real ,,,   i miss real"
This dude is bowser
"Idk why ppl are so apprehensive to admit that talk shows are ALWAYS rehearsed, and the celebrities who go to them know exacltly what they will do, especially bits like this, which are PERFECTLY timed to happen before a commercial, it's TV ffs, it's been like that since forever Lol, they might not tell them the full details of every game, but please, Jimmy brought the Sax-A-Boom with the mic fully plugged, and Jack as they mentioned has done this before... I even thought the way he acted so surprised when Jimmy pulled out the Sax-A-Boom, it was a bit sarcastic on purpose, by the way he immediatly jumped into the fun part of the bit, showing he obviously knew that's exactly what everybody expecting, and that's  his unique and energetic way to entertain..."
The drums coming in was the best
sax-a-boom
my favorite sax bands are Moon Hooch and Too Many Zoos I am a Saxist I play for myself I listen to Brasshouse Vol 1 Survival Of The Flyest and Joshua Tree https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj4o5BefAF7lvcEvQyIGRXTqUT_NnFTT6&feature=shares
"Ok but can someone please drop a song with this beat, it slaps"
"Takes a toy and makes it into his own band on stage, on air"
89M views. At least half of those are mine. This clip is mesmerizing. Jack Black fucking rocks.
jack is awsome !!!!!
"""He's probably cheating on me!"" Me and the boys:"
Jack Black is just CJ with maximum Charisma
these things are like 600 bucks
Is he really playing?
I could watch a movie with Jack Black ABOUT Jack Black Co-starring Jack Black all day long!
I cant get enough of this video! What a legend!
Lanterna cun talk
This guy could make funerals fun
holy shit that's flipping amazing
I can watch this in loop till i die
"Once Jimmy clues in that they're going to commercial, The Roots just start slamming hard."
Jimmy just dying in the back
Your dead to me
If they made Jack black do the commercial for saxaboom that shit would've sold out.
This slaps so hard lol
I fucking love jack black
This performance will never get old.
we need to start pointing jack black directly at evil
Damn this is fire
"Jack Black is a gem, we need to protect him at all cost"
Jack black is one of my favorite actors
If we could only harness that energy there would be no more energy crisis.
WOW!!!!! And copletely unrehearsed too.
Jimmy fallon is the only person who respects people in interview
And this is one of many reasons why The Roots are the greatest band of all time.
"Who else is just seeing a big awwwwwsome  panda playing a saxophone say 1234 123mf 1234 and walking across the stage all goofy?

Just me? Ok then"
This lives in my head rent free!!!
Another fabulous Gen Xer
How does a drummer know how to just pick up and crush a song like that. Do they feel it in their bones or something
For some reason my brain heard that megalovania song.
That sax-a-boom just slaps
I love that he walked over to the band instead of just making something himself
dance moves only jack black can do...
"The bard, himself"
Eddie riggs personality ever
Hahahahaha amazing
LOL.
What if bowser did this in the Mario movie
Hate how the saxaboom actually goes hard too
"Calm down, it's just a toy
https://youtube.com/shorts/g98SC_QxIDI"
"Look at his face at 01:53
It really takes years to master that."
1:35 the beat is just fire
i come here just to look at the band's faces whenever i feel like shit and it works every time. thank you our lord and savior jack black
Gay.
"It's hilarious that those Saxabooms are rare as a Stradivarius nowadays, sometimes on Ebay they'll go for a $1000! It's like at what point why don't u just get a real sax lok"
good times
"Fisher Price's Sax-a-Boom toy.  But, can he play a violin?"
His a musical Genius since the House of Rock
My god he's good and he still has the energy of a new born Chihuahua
"Man I miss the old days, when comedy wasn't about disparaging political enemies for the sake of it."
God imagine the confidence in this man.
Jimmy Kimmel is just so fake in contrast to actually talented entertainers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MCN_7jpYig
Jack Black is Leonardo DiCaprio if Leo is fat
Old shrives; back to the salt mines and dewy decimal system they came from; for the good of the land.
First decree; no more dictators who don't rock
"Make 
Americans
Rock
Again!"
"Make 
Earth
Home 
Again"
Do it do it do it do it do it
No President has ever played a sax a boom or ever thought about inward singing the inauguration speech.
Jack Black will be the first White Black man in the Whitehouse;if he would run for Us President 2024 Sax a booming the old shrives out of city hall for the good of the land eternally
jack black would make me join lgbtq ngl
bro can swear LOL
Black can just look down to see the sax-a-boom that Jimmy picked up for him
Found one at the thrift shop.

Jimmy's laugh was so fake
"Jack Black, you are just a card's game called Blackjack but you play music, so..."
LMFAO
Jack black is my new favourite person
jack black is the female gaze. i love him
I come back to this video often
This sounds like some sonic shit
He's a funny funny Man
Master !!!!
It does show how much h8s years to master it payed off!! He did amazing.
Jack Black could actually murder someone by being too funny.
Jack Black is an idiot.
Am I the only one who thought of the video game Earthworm Jim with that song? 1:18
1:35 when i get a win
The band passes the vibe check
Typical pathetic yank crap. Everything is is prerecorded and fake
The band effortlessly joining us is the coolest part! Does anyone know if that was scripted or if it actually happened on stage with no prior planning???
Before jimmy went wack
Pure talent from the bones
"Jack Black is not just an incredible musician and singer and performer, he's also a sexy dancer and no I'm not gay I'm 100 percent straight lol"
Jack Black is amazing and awesome

Apparently I want friend like Jack Black)))
Jack would be the ultimate MLB mascot.
"Jack Black's parents discovered he was a musical prodigy when they saw him wailing out complex solos on the Saxaboom at the ripe age of 3 years old. Now a virtuoso of the instrument, Black continues to wow audiences to this day with a level of funk only the Saxaboom can achieve."
The JOY. This is superior genius with a PHD in fun.
Jack Black somehow got a +50 in Charisma when he was in character creation
The Roots are a hidden legend!!!
Ahhh Cellllo...that was amazing!!
Jack Black is the chosen one. He is the messiah.
Jack Black is that one kooky uncle that we all like better than our own parents!
"Literally one of the top three most challenging instruments to play (nevertheless to master) and this glorious man not only blesses us with a rare performance, but also makes it look so effortless."
bro
God
"This would be a good video if Jimmy Fallon wasn't there with the vintage fake laugh,desk slap, and totally cringe dancing if you can even call it that"

My man speaks like a Tumblr user and I love it

jack black is what you get when you dump all your points into charisma
"Jimmy thinks: This is my job and I get paid for being with legends, I love it!"
Protect Jack at all costs
