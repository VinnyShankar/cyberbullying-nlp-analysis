Gosh watching Bob's old videos makes me want to paint a masterpiece even though it probably won't be when I'm finished LOL.
soemeon still watching his videos
"When you watch and observe Bob Ross painting, you *will* become lost in the world he's making one brush stroke at a time. His art, his mannerism and meekness defined all of these beautiful works to inspire."
"""people will think that you worked for WEEKS doing this with a one haired brush"" - Bob the HILARIOUS"
"My wife and I loved Bob's shows even though we never painted , and were very saddened by his death.The gentle voice and relaxed manner should be an inspiration for everyone."
He's considered the father of asmr
My girl loves you
I just watch it at 5 am purely amazed with my mouth opened
I love how wholesome he is
"Thank you for inviting me Bob, i made new friends today. As I continue to enjoy your guidance, advice and gentle motivation; I'm excited to paint what i want and feel to my own heartbeat. 

I've gained new tree friends, because i went out and took your advice. My clouds nowadays are very expressive and busy.

I do believe i can paint, thank you very much!

I do believe in happy accidents and wish all others to believe in themselves.

When a situation warrants it; ""beat the devil out of it""!

 Sincerely, 

""Tree"" Friend"
"Bob Ross reminds you, that YOU ALL are Happy Accidents!


Not mistakes.






Regardless what others say."
27:00 listen carefully
Tour work is ameizing
3 hairs and some air.....
Hbh
i loved it.
The intro makes it complete.
One of these GREAT ARTIST OF ALL TIME
I never realized how many people bob touched with his paintings and soft demeanor. I watched all the time as a kid cuz it was one of the channels we had cuz we didn't have cable. It was pbs channel. Now I'm older and realize how many others have fond memories of this man it's crazy to think back on it
idk who is behing this account but you are the best hustler i never see
ok?
Bob Ross videos are by far my favorite thing to watch while high
"I love that man so much, he has all my heart..."
"Huge credit to the audio engineer Jerry Morton, who captured these incredibly clean recordings of Bob over the years."
"I would like to have a word with the execs, I think ya'll are abusing Bob Ross, he's always talking about ya'll yelling at him, and we just can't allow that"
This video is reserved for the nights when one really needs a deep sleep
Big tree!!!!!!
This is proof that ASMR was a thing before YouTube
Liquid hwhite forever . I wish Bob Ross was alive he is such a good person.
He was a smoker and I think that was his worst behavior.  I would love to have even one conversation with this man.
I love Bob he warms my heart
Lol
4am and I'm watching bob ross paint...
"Interesting fellow but doesn't really explain anything..I mean, what is the liquid white for instance....How about perspective tone? Not much info. Anyway, very relaxing."
Dude was a genius legend who just wanted to teach people the joys of painting
"I was to use Bob Ross's words, my mum's ""happy little accident"""
Rip legend
wish i had known of Bob Ross when I was in school.  Art class painting projects would've been so much better
".


































.."
"Bob,ross,"
so... easy?
"i wish this man was still alive, i was born after his death but i wish i grew up wth him

just watchin this helped me want to get into art"
I cant belive that he died 30 years ago...
"He's missed!! I love his paintings, he makes it looks so easy! RIP"
Anybody else get super nervous when he holds that loaded palet so close to his pristinely white shirt?
Bob I know you died love ur art rip
"He is two in one
he is a man and an almighty master painter."
3 Hours of his videos feels like 3 minutes. you cant get enough.
Wow he said roll the tape back oh the old good times.
He relaxes me.
This is the speedrun we didnt know we needed.
"This channel is so poorly organised! 670 videos, millions on subscribers, yet no real structure to playlists or videos.
Post every season as a play list in order. Do what Bob would have wanted. Providing free, simple escapism that is needed more than ever."
He paints the picture before it gets printet
Bob Ross is the kinda guy to get into an argument with a tree
Thank you Bob Ross for always having since of humor! You constantly make me laugh. But knowing you have passed away is really sad. Not only you taught me how to paint but you also make me cry. You are truly a legend and I hope you are taking well care of in heaven. Rest in peace Bob Ross your death truly put me in great sadness. May you Rest in peace.
"Bob is the original g, teaching us how to paint at a college level but better than any teacher I ever had"
27:00 did ross just let the frogs out or what
You have no 100b
I love you so much and hope you have a 1
As a child I would run after school to watch him and he will always be part of heart especially with my art<3 I will ALWAY LUBB him<3  Bob to me will always be a beautiful BEAUTUFUL man.
Very nice asmr
This was banned in UK. Not if you have VPN though
I just hope that one day I'll find the kind of peace that allows me to enjoy doing anything as much as Bob enjoyed painting mountains in 25 minutes.
"I bet Bob never imagined at the time, all these years later, he would be the beloved person, we all know today."
Riligion islam is the riligion of god
Do you know riligion islam
Wiggle it
His control of the brush is just astounding.
I love bob ross but he was definitely a serial killer
I just don't know color mixing and when to use it.
whoever remixed the audio so the brush strokes sound like a truck has made this unwatchable
Magic
Bob Ross = PAINTING GOD
God bless
us voice is my sleeping ring tone
"I knew Bob Ross with memes but I never knew who he was and why he became such a meme. Now I know. His voice is relaxing and we can see he is very passionate about what he's doing which make me wanting to learn with him, even if I never paint in my entire life. He was such a great human being. Rest in peace, legend!"
One of the biggest wastes of money in human history is the manufacturing of the buttons on Bob Ross' shirts.
Mount Fuji ?
Where in the timeline does this fit for the joy of painting cu.
Back when TV shows were good.
Hi
"I love bob Ross his videos and I actually made his artwork
It was very hard"
He makes it look so easy
masterpiece.
So mesmerising even after all these years I used to watch Bob when I skipt school
Eu gosto de sopa
"Pov: you are not into painting but you'll watch a 1 hour long video with bob ross in it, asmr at it's finest"
Smash
Oh Bob... the world misses you soooo much
"So ASMR.  Wasn't this man once a drill sergeant?, who would've thought"
Bob's voice is soothing
"Bob Ross: The world's first youtuber, and the only whiteman brave enough to sport and afro and have no one question it."
Me casually watching him at 2 am while eating food
"Such a great talent.  Love it, beautiful!!!"
Watching Bob Ross videos always help me relax and happy
Cultural appropriation!!! As a black bi non-binary I have to protest!
"Other than the video quality, this video is really timeless"
he makes it look so easy
That little laugh at 7:27 about spraying your whole room with thinner is great
"I love Bob Ross's voice! 
"
"Bad quality
Amazing painting/video/ therapy session"
Siempre e admirado y seguido
This is wizadry
Freddie Dredd
"Me, a person who doesn't paint, never did, never will: aaah, yes, what an interesting technique!"
Who is getting paid off his work?
This guy is alright though.
Bob Ross makes my nips drip
Bob Chad
I don't think there's a single person on earth that has ever lived or will ever live that hates Bob Ross.
you died and did not see how Ai ruin arts
"8 YEARS AGO..., WHERE IS BOB ROSS NOW ...?
---
11 JUNE 2023 , SUNDAY ."
"even though Bob passed long before i was born, i somehow really miss him and wished he couldve lived long enough to give us more of these videos"
Moo .o
O omo no mo9 me me mono no o no o.9
"it's only 9 minutes in and it's just relaxing with how mild he's speaking while talking about it, and he was a drill sergeant...ph lord if there was ever a man who had been born to do something it was this."
Bob Ross was self actualized:. He was one of the few who ended up doing what he was born to do.
"Bob Ross isnt gone, hes just painting pictures and giving tutorials in God's kingdom :)."
29:37 Bob are you really just going to gloss over this comment and not tell us what the first thing to go is???
The video looks like in 1999
"I miss TV moving at this pace...Levar Burton on reading rainbow, Mr. Rodgers, Bob Ross, etc. didn't need to fast-paced scream at you to lock your attention."
Youtube getting very comfy with all them commercials on 20 seconds
"Thank you for painting Slayers Reign in Blood album cover.
Many would say it is a Satanic depiction and they most likely are right but in the wrong context.
It was not a glorification of evil and it depicts some of the repulsive human beings that ever existed such as Joseph Mengele.
I can't think of a better place for such a butcher.
A depiction of hell is simply that and no more.
Hieronymus Bosch did the same.

Rest in peace, your work was beautiful."
This is my first Bob Ross painting :)
.
"""then you BEAT THE DEVIL OUT IT"""
Like the usual
Omg diss is amazing
As weird as it sounds this is smoothing to look at .... I mean i am high asf but still lol
Is he using acrylic paint or oil paint?
"I love Bob, my hole life is he my inspiratian and i learnt  from him so mucch."
Warning do not attempt to listen to this while driving it just might put you to sleep lol
(To skip supplies list: 2:14 - 4:04)
I can see the disappointment in Bob's eyes when the producers asked him to promote the products.
Baraa ross >>> bob ross
He Drew very good.respect.
"Like Elvis , He's more popular now than he was when he was alive. He has YouTube by the balls lol"
"TOP - DANKE BOB, wir lieben DICH <3"
Now I know where Michal Jackson got his theme for one of his songs ..Beat it!!
this man was a magician
They have to give him a small canvas or else he would be there all day somehow making a perfect painting more perfect
Wonderful lesson.
All I can say is that this brings back memories of my childhood. I used to always see him in tv as I would flip through channels .
The original ASMR
"""We don't make mistakes, we make happy accidents"""
I hope Bob Ross could help me paint a really cool painting of God's kingdom or paint one for me lol
"Meaning, those sons of guns."
The unbuttoned shirt!
"Bob Ross is one of the greats, and will never be forgotten."
Hes like the painter version of Chuck Norris
Mr. Ross is the great granddaddy of ASMR. His style of speaking is always so soothing. This is what I watch to unwind for the day before hitting the sack.
I painted my first painting in 1995 after he died...
rip bob ross the goat
"""take your time and work at your own pace, speed comes with practice"" something to remind ourselves about life,"
love you bob ross
"I never watched bob ross before like a year ago and when i started i was like ""man this is the asmr that i never thought i needed"" Honestly the paint knife is some of the best parts for me but when i am awake i'll never get over his charming laugh when he beats the paint brush with that chuckle always saying ""just beat the devil out of it"""
"I've never painted in my life, probably never will, and yet I just watched all of that"
Is it weird that these painting videos help me fall asleep at night!!
what the point of asmr when you have bob ross
"happy little clouds, we dont make mistakes life is just a happy accident xxxx I wish we had another bob ross"
Which holy angel bestowed this video on me. Because I want to say thank you
"I was setting up my fish tank today and a rockery I made fell apart when I moved it, but it ended up looking even cooler. I bob ross'd it."
26:59 just little fart in there
2023 anyone?
"Bob Ross: paints mountain, looks like real one
Me: tries to paint a mountain, looks like i smeared diarrhea on canvas"
"We had a very early Bob Ross painting that he did on a gold pan that my mom and dad got while he was stationed in Alaska, when we returned to Vermont after my father's tour of duty was up, it wound up stored in our garage and my overbearing grandmother decided we didn't need a bunch of the stuff in our garage and gave it away. Who knows where it is now....."
this gfuy relaxied my as a teenager...thank you Bob....definate calmness medicine. mental massage
"God blessed us so much to loan us this man.

Thank you God for Bob Ross."
2015
Ayo did he fart at 26:58
If this don't make you feel happy and safe you have no soul
Did you ever notice how there are never any Bob Ross paintings for sale .  Could that be because they look silly off the TV screen?
I have no talent on painting but is till watch Bob videos cuz i use them as Asmr therapy for sleep. It helps me to sleep listening to him.
"27:00 Oh my god, was that a Bob Ross fart?"
This is one of the best painters at work and one of the nicest people I've ever seen at work
"It feels weird to hear ""run the tape back"" in this year"
Bros been gone 30 years and there just now making a movie about our god
"Bob: see how that pops right out?
Me: reaching for sidearm
Bob: becomes your friend?
Me: gets embarassed immediately about my hasty behavior
Moral of the story: Love each other folks, and allways listen to Bob"
What kind of paints are you using acrylics ? And how are you cleaning them?
Beat the devil out of it
"Life just doesn't care. This man was wonderful and had such a good and kind aura about him, but he gets taken out by cancer at age 52? It always blows my mind that he's gone. I watched the painter he learned from before Bob even started this show. I still remember watching both shows when Bob started painting. We had a PBS Public Broadcasting Station and this was on there along with many other shows like Nova."
Just tap it
Slept like a baby cuz of this
"Came for 10:05, 13:27 20:55 22:45 25:47 46:18"
At the 13:00 minute mark the paint already looks awesome with just blue and a few paint brushes. What a legend
Bob Ross was YouTube before there was YouTube
Black isnt a color
I remember watching this as a yougster. Such great memories
You're here because of deadpool

"I laugh like hell when he beats the crap outa his big brushes after cleaning them in paint thinner,, he gives that smirk like he wants to say it but knows probably he get ran off the air by the supers hahaha"
Imagine Bob as an interior painter.
Let's all take a moment to appreciate everyone involved in creatng all of the equiptment Bob utilizes.
29:00 straight up!
I was recently in a doctor's office that showed Bob Ross in the waiting area. I've never felt so chilled out going to the doctor.
"I just got to know about this amazing Artist at an workshop i am hosting at Expo City Dubai 2023, this is an amazing artist! What a tragedy, i heard about his passing, what a great talent he had!"

Profesor quien sos
"All his paintings have the same features. Snow covered mountain, trees, bushes and a lake. He probably couldn't paint a portrait or a picture of a horse or something else."
"Brilliant Bob, great to watch."
I don't know why but painting videos make you fall asleep
The father of the ASMR and Happy Painters!

I don't drink iced tea but i went and got a glass when he told me to
"Funny, I was talking about Bob Ross to my bro this morning , and as if by magic a video appears , it""s as if my phone heard me or something ."
I wonder what would Bob Ross think of all this AI art drama that's happening on the internet right now...
why cant i watch specific vids cuz im from the UK
Even the music is great.
The best
i still watch when he has died almost 31years
"Until the mountain was painted, i was a pro in my mind. But after the mountain part i was dragged to reality that I'm no close to this man"
I remember watching him as kid....I think he was on PBS if remember right.
This is brilliant
What about doing an oak tree
"I stumbled across this amazing man on TV, ended up here on YouTube. I immediately felt like I knew him but I'm sure I have never watched it before. So comforting, so relaxing, so soothing."
I was wondering what happened to his paintings?
"i dont know mate, it more like 1 hours of relaxing ASMR either then painting tutorial"
Hard ro believe that Bob was a shout sweary sergeant in the army
I would always wake up early on Saturday morning to turn Bob Ross on and fall back asleep listening to him.

"Oh Bob, why did you have to leave so young? Lots of things broadcasted out there on mainstream media do not include educational videos like this, but why?"
I wish all of Bob's painting videos were an hour long.

"Bob Ross is how I discovered I had asmr but didn't know what the feeling actually was. Started watching Bob when I was 5 (I'm 38 now), I'd watch it on PBS,  Saturdays at 1pm. I'd be on the couch in the basement watching and the next thing I knew I'd be waking up about an hour later and having missed most of the episode. I'd get tingles and tiredness but had no clue 33 years ago that it was actually asmr, one of the best feelings in the world."
Ryan Renolds must have seen this
some the paint goes in the washer bucket but rest of it goes on the camera man
"I've watched maybe 3 minutes of this, from when he starts painting, and I already respect this man, and painters in general, much more then I did before. (Not because I disrespected them, I just had no opinions of them.)"
Wiggle it. Wiggle it.
My mom LOVES Bob ross
His voice is so calming
In the 90s when I was a kid my favorite show when I would stay home from school was Bob Ross. My mom would always found me pass out in the sofa. The GOAT
RIP
I am up anytime for a Bob Ross masterclass!
I wonder if all the chemicals from his paints and paint thinner caused his lymphoma. Sad that something he loved so much could have caused his illness and death.
"just watching all of it come together perfectly is sooooo satisfying! i love bob ross, legends never die"
"Waking up early in the morning in here in india in the month of January while i am waiting for the lords return, watching your video real gives me calm and relief. I wish i could have met you."

This dude is a freaking genius. And I hate that he isnt alive
You can see that he cares about his viewers
May he rest in peace in his beautiful world..
"I would come home from school, sit at my computer with a dozen Arizona ice teas and just relax while doing homework"

Me: Naw im just kiddin 
Bob Ross: (Personally takes that level of disrespect) makes the cloud
me: ok fine then"
Bob ross was a very nice guy he loved to paint and he died 8years ago and I just wanna say .R.I.P. Bob Ross.
I use his voice as sleep asmr
"He was such an enthusiastic and talented teacher! I wish my art teacher at school just set me up in a room with all the kit and one of Bob's tapes and I would've learnt a lot more than I did being ""taught"" directly by them."
video starts at 4:04
Bob Ross
"Bob Ross sounds a lot like Cole from the Dragon Age series.
""Make friends with a tree. Talk to him. Then you'll get to understand him."""
Bob Ross in my opinion is the best asmrtist
Beyond broken character
Who played on the jingle?
i need bob ross's paint strokes to procedural generate land for vide games. the amount of randomness but perfectness in creating the scenery would make amazing maps
the amount of detail i watched him put into this painting from simple devices. simple ideas. things you couldnt imagine. amazing.
If Bob says I am a sunbeam wandering around having a lots of fun Then I am a sunbeam wandering around having lots of fun
I have the tea and I have the power
I watch it too learn to paint and I just some time listen to it so u can sleep the sounds of him painting and talking makes me fall a sleep
R.I.P legend
"i got here from a hollow knight steam guide o_O


I'm not complaining, either"
"I'm not saying my art teacher was bad but if my art teacher teaches like you, my aim in life would be an artist."
Kinda sad how I never knew this amazing person when I was young
these videos have gotta be doing numbers like they wouldnt believe compared to when they first aired
"Bob Ross has never been a real artist.
He usually used a handful of simple tricks.
I never had seen him painting animals or persons.
Only:
sky
clouds
mountains
trees
bushes
water
a simple shed
not more.
Nevertheless-->nice paintings for the sleeping chamber
and painting for chilling."
I love it
Tooth?
Why the playlist have hidden episodes?
My dad is a big fan of his allwasy was
"if xqc reacted to this he would be like: ""OKAY DUDEEE"""

"A soft spoken, gifted genius who with the most simple technique could create a masterpiece. No mistakes, only happy accidents! RIP Bob Ross"
You are a legend rip
"I used to sit close to the tv, listen to his voice, and then wake up on the sofa"
"He didnt paint to show how good he was at painting.

He did it to show how good you were."
This is making NNN real hard
I wonder how many people pick a brush up while watching this lol
Goin sleep goodnight
"i needed to read a book for a school exam and I search for something to relax and I saw this video, i saw the 59 minutes and forgot about de book."
It's so PRETTY
Have I been sitting here watching Bob Ross paint for an hour? Yes. Have I been relaxing but not able to sleep because I wanna see what he does next to teach me how to paint? Also yes.
It is nice to see a Jew with his African connection by  his many great generation of the black woman...
I come back here every once in a while just to remind myself if you put your mind to it you can do it.
pure asmr when he puts that liquid white on
"ive fallen asleep to this guy at least three times, bob rest in peace you are such a godsend"

Bob Ross decided not to solve world peace because he believed enough in YOU to do it.
"bob, I dont think that rocks grow into mountains"
Happy little cloud

Absolutely Beautiful and Amazing paintings

"""People expect us painters to be half-crazy. That's alright, we can get away with it."""
I could never watch a full vid without sleeping my boy bob will forever live in my heart(Long live the Afro!)
"Wasn't even alive back then and I never heard of this dude until around like 2 years ago. My guy has my respect, legit. 

I think had it not been for his lymphoma issues, I honestly think he could have kept The Joy of Painting going, maybe like 2-4 more seasons (TJOP ended at 31 seasons). He was only 52 years old when he unfortunately passed."
"16:55
""Maybe our little mountain....lives right here.""
Proceeds to paint the mountain of God mentioned in the bible"

Ninety one time a week I watch
Bob Ross invented th ASMR videos Before YouTube was invented.
Bob Ross invented Hydrogen.
Caus' paining makes you Happy....great. balm for the soul....
Bob Ross IS ASMR
"Damn, everytime i watch Bob Ross video I suddenly wake up and realize it has been about 15-30 minutes and I fell asleep sometime ago cause he just hypnotizes and makes u sleep."
"It's about the chilling vibe he gives. Voice, his calmness, his energy he spreads. He was a sergant I think, means, he has dicipline, but also he believed in the Naturally way. He loved animals, and often said that things like animals or/and the nature a beautiful gods creation, and you can feel he says that at the bottom of his heart + he visualizes his feelings with this amazing paint pictures.

Here an example for his positive Mindset:
38:38 - 39:00"
"Man I wish Bob Ross was still with us, watching him talk and paint always brightens up my day."

This man is the definition of Wu Wei.
Bob Ross...The original King of ASMR
Who tried to paint it too?

this is a bit asmrish
The only SMR videos that is a scam what a concept
OK admit it we all came here after seeing the teaser for deadpool 2
thank you
Am I the only one here who watched this for the tutorial?
I have watched Mr Ross for years. He never failed to amaze me.  He was a wonderful and compassionate man. He offered us so much.  Not just his tremendous talent for painting but an opportunity to test our own waters.  He will live on in our hearts and minds forever.  Thank you Bob and God bless you.
Legend!!
w bob
"I used to watch BR when I was much younger. Without even realizing it, I found his videos very relaxing but I would never tell anyone I watched his videos. I was too self- conscious and slightly embarrassed people would think me strange. 40 years later I still watch his videos to help me fall asleep and relax. I sometimes use the alias Van Dyke Brown."
This is my therapy
Imagine someone watching Bob's videos perfecting their skills then selling those paintings as THEIR own!  Bob would beat the DEVIL out of 'em before the Law found them!
Rip bob.
This guy was such a legend rip
The Father of ASMR...
fun fact: bob ross was 188cm tall which is tall for avarage world wide
Even after he passed his YT channel is still going strong

Bob Ross is literally the great-great grandfather of asmr.

"Bob was ASMR decades before we even knew what that was.  Greatest of all time, thank you Mr. Ross for years and years of enjoyment."
I swear bob ross started Asmr ha
"I actually just sat down with a glass of ice tea and now I'm in this weird head space like"" how did he know?!?!?!"""

"Bob Ross: paints a painting to show us how to paint
Us: In our beds, just listening to him and getting chills behind our spine"
"Class, loved watching this when I was a kid"

"Wonderful! Very, very, wonderful!"
"Bob was a great man, it's a shame what happened. Be careful around all that paint thinner."
I'm gonna be a master painter
I remember being a kid hearing a soft spoken painter and wondered for years who is was !
"Coming home from work, stressful job in the city... Toss a Bob Ross video on and chill out. This man was the real deal. Thanks, Bob."
At least out there has no electrical outlets.
The Master of asleep...
This is hands down best intro song of all time
Bob sliding in some merch plugs
"I love him, so much. I wish to have such healing voice like him."
I love these videos so much but I find it incredibly sad that he is no longer with us.
beautiful human
I watch his videos to go to sleep every night
"Boss Ross 
present: asmr origins"
Sad what they done to him..after he passed..
What is not to love about this man.
This guy can talk me to sleep everyday.
"Bob Ross is a legend who will live on forever, his soft reassuring voice makes you feel at ease. Even if you can't paint, just watch and listen. RIP Mr Ross."

I would have no Goddamn patience painting while listening to Bob. I would end up killing myself with Prussian blue paint mixed with the hue of my blood under a toxic white background.
I sleep
"When you watch bob ross, he lets ya know a part of him that is mostly peaceful, crazy to think this man was in the military"
4:06

Serial killer
What a helmet
First ASMR
Did Bob upload this video YouTube straight after he finished the painting?
33:58 for a second i thought my eyes  went blurry. He blended the reflections so well that with just a few strokes it emerged as magic to the eyes.
His voice is amazing!
"I used to watch his show when I was 6 or 7. And after around 13 years, it still binges me to the screen"
This man did not miss
The cameraman was asleep at the wheel during this filming.
This lovely meditation puts me right into the most perfect sleep
"Bob Ross's works are revolutionary just as the big ones from the past like Da Vinci, Michelangelo and Picasso"
My jaw dropped when he added that lighting to the mountain
27:00 err...
I remember waking up like 8 in the morning to sit with my mom and drink some tea watching bob ross when it was on tv in 2010 or something
