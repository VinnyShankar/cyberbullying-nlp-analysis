Too bad it's old. No one does it anymore in my city. Stopped years ago.
I WONDER IF THIS CAN BE USED FOR TATTOOS ON HUMAN SKIN.
That is dope as hell!
Wow
Whoa!!!
Should swipe the top layer away when it's underwater so you don't get layers of crud
That's really cool but how do they apply it to the side of trucks and busses?
Machine would do this better and cheaper.
Wow awesome
Awsome
How did the graphics get in the water?
Amazing
What chemicals are used in process is it skin safe?
Amazing! Absolutely beautiful
Easy
Now bro got talent
Bro that OnE dent
Please dont make your job bigger than it is. Its Not difficult like you say. You literally stick a picture on different things.  Nothing more and it's not that difficult.  So please don't act like she's a watchmaker or a surgeon.
I dont have parents please help mee please help me anna

Think about the poor guy that did that by hand with a brush when he found out you could dip it!
That is so awesome
But why would you want that
krutooooooo

Excellent work precise movement great speed excellent finish
"This is retarded, just make a machine for it already."
"Didn't realise how easy it was, and those sad bastards over charge for this crap"
I want to have my lambo wheels done in a carbon fiber pattern.  How much to do the 4?
Where can I find the material for hydro dip

Meh. Prefer airbrush and actual artwork over a fkn liquid sticker.
You can have a shaky hand
He puttting more care into that fender than he puts into his own soul.
"What I'm more curious about is not how you press and print it, but how you present the picture on the liquid"
Nice
Cool
The aftrr is fricking gotgeous.
Candy???
That takes zero skill anyone can do that
Where does this go?
How does that not shear?  Sorcery.
Wow! That is neat!!
Not bad
Surely they'd have machines doing that sort of work?
Liked x1000
EXCELENTE
"Oh, my gosh, that is sick.
I always wondered how it was done fantastic."
"Looks like trash, ngl."
it is so satisfying
I wonder where they liquid concoction ends up...
This guy played Operation as a kid.
One of the strangest types of painting I've ever seen...
A waste of our precious resources! We need water for life not vanity!
nice
Stupid graphic...cool process!
"I think that's beautiful , I'm gonna try to learn how to do that"
This guy have dso many dollars
Hydro dipping is so amazing
I need to learn this
#CorridorDigital
Looks cool and stupid at the same time
Ghetto
Just wasting water
"""Have to have steady hands "" lmao!"
I always wondered how they did that.
I would love to learn how to do it
"Cooler? Looks like something a pimp would do his 1961 Cadillac. Bad taste, son."
so much skill to make such tacky work
Such an amazing process. The results are incredible.
I've done some of this hydro dipping not to that scale mainly smaller things but it's really satisfying
"It's one of the easiest things to do without any training, what's the big deal?"
"That doesn't look cooler, just douchier."
"Really, its amazing"
hi boroo

How the hell do they get the patterns in the liquid in the first place to stay that still
The mild static sound is cool
krass
Great skill. But no accounting for taste of the customer. Yeeesh talk about generic and gaudy without any focal point or purpose.
How do u create that pattern in the liquid to begin with?
Cool and beautiful
Why??
So awesome!
WTF?!
Awesome Amazing and incredibly Beautiful.
I want this job
The fake sounds are stupid as hell.
Hermoso!!!
No idea how that works but it's definitely cool as hell.

Basically water marbling
Show
Yssjla
Now that's a real paint job my local shops have to upgrade immediately
crazy
Omg
Looks awesome my friend mikes bike was done like that it looks amazing
What they don't tell ya is it doesn't last very long and it's kind of like a temporary tattoo type of deal
"I love this, what an art"
It actually doesn't look that hard and probably not that hard. I feel like I can do it too.
Hey..new idea. Removable full body tattoos.
It's cool but lame designs
Is that a chemical reaction making that sound?
Looks like magic
That is so cool
Looks sub-par quality.
wonderful
Almost always looks super corny.
Bro what are these sound effects
Or it just makes it look tacky and cheap as hell
Looks easy enough
Espectacular!
Ooooooh so that's how you make livery on the cars very nice
Sick!
That stuff will give your vehicle cancer.
"Never heard of this, but this is very cool."
Satisfying

It would take days to paint this fender and now just minutes
Doit to my guitar my friend.
Nice work
to have a very steady hand? my hands got it's own 8.4 magnitude
Brother what is the name of the process
What. Just. Happened..
"Beautiful,  stunning!"
How much is this
Dooooope
I can put a straight line
"It takes zero talent to hydro dip. Try it, you'll find it very easy. Just go slow."
Sick !
Looks great
Ruined
do you ever mess up
It's mind blowing to see how much ingenuity and effort goes into making people look like douchebags.
That's awesome
skill lol
I got a friend who would LOVE that design!
his words pup like notification
Bro just created the wildest looking mudguard I have ever seen

"Yes, artificial sounds, that's what people need.

Stop ruining your senses people."
It's insane how they do drawing on water 1st instead of drawing directly on metal part.
Awesome work
LOOKS LIKE SHIT

"That looks a lot like ABS or Glass?  If so, it's even more impressive."
"The people who made the markings in the water should be congratulated, cause it must take a ton of effort to do that"
One thing (asmr)
"Cool process and all, but the art is kinda cringe."
Can you dip rims to be pink camo?
"Too bad the pattern came out of some 6th grade kids notebook labeled ""cool stuff I like""."
Very satisfying results :)
I can literallySmell it through the screen
Incredible
Reeady for buying of licence is sukhoi
Imagine if Michael j fox hydro dipped
What if you fuck up?
I can tell you I absolutely would not like whoever got that design on anything they own
Well done great job
Masterpiece
Ugly
This is that kind of job that soon will dissappear because of robots
It's really super easy
Is that an airplane door?
What kind of black magic sorcery is this??

"back in my young days i did the very same ""kinda"" on a scale model, tiny diff i used a stickers with water instead of paint and water =D"
"Just use a Robotic arm , more consistent"

That's crazy
That looks sooo dumb
This ultra thin film of paint will start to fall off as soon as tomorrow.
Awesome technology is something else
Looks stupid
What if I take a dip in it?
Looks immature. Uneducated underclass..
"U dont need steady hand, u need electromotor with chain"
And just like that it looks like shit
"Gd this is awesome! 
Want this done to my RatRod, now!"

"""SICK STICK!"""
This is most likely a fender for a jeep. Those jeep drivers go crazy over their cosmetics

Looks like something a 12yr old would design
Tight yo!
How u draw in liquid
It instantly makes things look so much more ghetto
How in the hell does the liquid keep the icons from swirling away?!

I definitely agree with you
I would completely mess that up
Nice Work

That was the most satisfying thing to watch and my jaw hit the floor with the results 
Amazing"
Very cool
Is that car for a 13 year old boy?
"Wait, how do the patterns (on top of the liquid) get made in the first place?"
"I was wondering why they were covering up that beautiful red, but it turned out great."
A puro desperdiciar agua
How the fuck is that even possible
Oh I want my whole car dipped in it
Wow now it looks tacky as shit! Good job!
"Very good and nice art work whoever designed it but imagine taking every piece of the car off to do that, it's exhausting just thinking about it. There must be a better way."
Cartoons weren't lying
Cost
Hand falls off in 18 months
Siiii... Satisfactoriooooo...

Crazeeee
Shit job gl next time
Dope
"I think I can do the dipping part just fine, but will mess it up on the pulling out part....I always have an issue with pulling out"
Those the actual sounds it makes? Or that sound effects added
Wuee

"""You have to have a steady hand for hydrodipping"" 

My ADHD/anxiety brain: Ok I'll see myself out"
So this isn't the warzone basic camo?
Can this be done on an aluminum laptop lid?
"Forget the dipping, how did they paint that on the liquid?"
I thought the metal was melted
It made that sound when my boom-boom hits the toilet water.
The question is who would want this crap on their car?
Looks great.
"Whats with the fake sound effects? I get it,  some videos get enhanced with foley effects, which is fine. These are in uncanny valley territory though. Namely the water splash at the start tbh."
I kind of preferred that beautiful solid red
Wow!!!  Very cool!!!
I only see alot of random marks. No offense. Im sure it looks great in person
Childish and cheap looking.
again just a job nothing amazing yet the internet loses it imagine if youd go out and learn a craft then you wouldent have to watch others

I feel like it's all in the shake.
Aren't there machines that can do that ?
Wack
That's nice
Bet they can make meth with that shit
It's interesting how the image doesn't warp due to the strange shape.
That's an amazing job & a really insane design & process
So why the hell am I spending hours getting tatted when I can just dip my arm in some water
"amazing, very good impeccable work, very good"
How you draw in the water???
then you have to clear coat it to stay on I would think. How about print on uv stable vinyl?
My pattern would be all rippley.

Where are you located
Won't it wash off after awhile?
So gay
Wow a process for destroying a nice candy red paint job. Count me in.
"Hydro dipper: You have to have an extremely steady hand to this
Machine: step aside"
Why the sizzling?
This is totally meth! Wow!

Must be a really inexpensive price"
One shot better not fudge up
"in my day we got paid GOOD money to airbrush all those designs on there, now these guys under cut painters prices with these decals. in a few years no one will care about human art."

I wish tattoos worked like that
I had trouble applying decals to an Airfix model
How do they get the design to stay on the water?
I agree
If I take my cars body to you can you hydro dip the whole thing
Probably the only person I saw wearing protective gear for this work. Kudos
Sick
Hydro dipping is so cool. I could watch these videos for hours

This is how I paint my nails

"Looks like a year 45 old tattoo, perfect for who ever owns it"
"So, from reading the comments below, I think I am getting a better understanding of the process... I have done paper marbling and the technique seems similar: paints are applied to a water surface and float there. Then they are ""combed"" into a design and a clean sheet of paper is laid on the paint and then quickly lifted up, bringing the combed design up with it. (Examples of beautiful paper marbling can be seen on the end papers inside the covers of both antique and modern bespoke books.)"
hydro dip your balls
All that work to make generic garbage
"""Onto any material"" except hair"
This is wild. There's so many ways to put graphics on things. This looks like one of the hardest ways but looks cool as hell
Wooooooooow
I appreciate the fact that materialism is fuckall to this dude.
It's amazing how this was developed. Human ingenuity!
Dang
I knew Santa's elfs could do it in theory!
This feels like s job a machine should do

"Hydro dipping is easily worse than calling your rep wheels and yellow tinted headlights ""a build""."
How long does that even last?
How dangerous are the chemicals
Is so satisfasing !!!
DedSec would love this
Smasch
Cool!
But how long does the wrap last for
That was insane.
This is called water transfer painting. Water transfer film will be lay on the water then a water transfer spray (some kind of glue) are sprayed on the film before dipping the object. Water transfer film has various design but the only water transfer spray i know is a samurai brand. This look easy but the fact that the film can get wrinkle when working with it make this guy a professional. Someone who hasnt had any experience could've done it but not as good as this
But how do you put that design on the water?
Ebruli
Just use a machine to dip it
This is extremely satisfying.
The red colour is beautiful
Doesn't seem like a booming fast growing career
Taking a nice beautiful red color and print a tacky design over it
Never seen this before! Is that ink floating on the water surface? what?
good. beautiful
good
Utterly tasteless ... ugh!
The most interesting question is how do you get the pictures on the water?
the kadunk is what it sounds like on the throne
What's the step before that though when it comes to the liquid?
But why? If you're more than 10 feet away the car just looks dirty.
Massive!..
This is taken from the Turkish EBRU Art.
"i disagree with the end he should have had 
someone help him clear the water of the 
paint still floating on it , as to not ruin 
the design already on the part .

just one speck of paint that sticks to it 
could ruin it . 
but the dipping was absolutely top level
hats of for that"
Wowwwww so satisfying
Looks like melting illusion
Remember to not drink too much coffee when you're doing this job.
i thought it was a mat lol
