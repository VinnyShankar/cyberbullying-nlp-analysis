Phantastic Gus is my spirit animal.
Mark 0 : 1 squirrels
Just combine all the bird feeders into a custom bird feeder
"3:00 if you are new to this channel and this is the first video you see on this channel, this is the moment you see how magnificent this guy can be"
Yes you do have too much time on your hands. Very ingenious.
hurr dahh dur i gooofy maaanannn tattt says dat la is anananamainl  abbousouse BOIIII
46$ lol it is 60 but its on a discount
From bird watcher to SQUIRREL watcher: Legacy
Adult normal ninja squirrel
10/10
The montage is actually 18 seconds long
Mark makes science easy..
That montage was 13 seconds long
My kids and I happened to come across this video and it was super! big thanks for making this.
How come if he uses slippery poles he could just put the bird seed on it?
Make a real life wubbox
Phat gus pigging out.....I'm dead
Phat gus
I enjoyed your creativity and narrative very much! And aren't these little ones adorable and so smart.
"I'm sorta like Billy, the kid knocking these  critters off. I can pop one in the head from 30 yards with a metal bb"
i wish mark rober was one of my uncles bro
I so agree.  I watch about a dozen scurry and leap around my back deck every morning.  One stands upon my shopvac and just looks directly at me for a half a minute through the window.  Love em.  Hate to see a few of them suffer with skin diseases or injury.
This is frikkin amazing! Thanks so much for the fun... I have squirrels who frustrate me with my new Bird Buddy!
Can we appreciate that he put a disclaimer for the maze of a thousand corridors in the beggining.
Take a moment to catch Ohio in this video
"The squirrel picnic table is awesome, so cute!  . I would literally watch a whole season of Squirrel Wipeout.."
"Was it Rick, Marty, Frank, or phat Gus who knocked down the second bird feeder?"
Me if I was mark rober: I designed five machines to end squirrels
"My Dad loved watching birds, and after trial and error, he came up with his own solution. He used 1/2"" or 3/4"" electrical galvanized poles. Planted them into the ground away from trees or anything that an animal could potential jump from, usually in the middle of the yard. He then took some stove pipe and hardware cloth, wrapped the stove pipe around the pole about mid way up it and then put the hardware cloth in the middle and top of the stove pipe - usually preventing any animal (squirrels and raccoons) from being able to get to the bird and suit feeders. 

It works really well, I still have some that I helped my Dad put up three years ago, using zip ties to attack brackets on to the pole and then the feeders onto the brackets. It's amazing how strong and durable zip ties are."
I really appreciate the effort put into this because I rescue baby squirrels!
"I was introduced to this series in Art class it was on the TV I'm so excited to re-watch it!
I didn't exepect to lauph and smile so much haven't seen content like this in a while incredible job thankyou for all work put in and sharing it!"
Fantastic!
Just watched from Gateway Pundit. Great video!
A true genius would have made a dedicated channel for the squirrel obstacle course with proper sports commentary.
Phat Gus is pregnant
now whats your favorite animal ;)
"Dude you're a genius! I've seen so many of your videos, but this is probably my favorite!!! Thanks for making me laugh!"
Firgott the optikal iluzion
I'm so building a low-tech version of this when I get a house someday.
1:57
The most uselesss video ever
This has been very entertaining to watch thank you
12:12 Rick: T-th-this is-urrrrp!-this is just sloppy craftsmanship.
Fat Gus is a girl
The gold digger plush and the mini squirrel table at the end had me dying laughing lol
"Mark ,can u tell us all the songs from  the vid pls"
wow
Moral of the story: Nothing is squirrel proof
I'M able to blink faster pal :P
The bird cussing out the squirrel for knocking down the feeder was perfect.
i wouldn't be surprised if a squirrel civilization popped up after humanity went extinct
Ha ha have  a squirrel in my Garden who i hand feed.. called Gus....and yep! found out Gus is a Girl.....and yep...the Fattest squirrel in the Garden...
Mark you know that there are bird feeders that spin to get rid of squirrels
Squirrels persistent pests.
It's so funny at 1:57
FRANK TEAM
Lol
I think this is some of the rare video that YouTube was originally created for.
i came here thinking about skiping the intro but it was so nice to listen and watch
"Yeah, high powered pellet gun or 22 LR OR squirrel stew."
This is the most amazing video i have seen so far on Youtube
Thank you.
"A fun, fancy walkway (or jumpway) for theivin squirels."
classic already
Squirrel launch is not ok... It's gotta go.
I LOVED THIS VIDEO! More squirrels! More! More! More!
DUN DUN DUN!!!!!! NINJA SQUIRREL!!!!!! (This was supposed to be a funny)
"""break it"" is always a valid puzzle solution"
"Five stars Fantastic job in your filming, narrator, layout, execution, & ...your film shows all the many talents it takes to create such entertainment, really fun to watch Thank you"
Life with you would never be boring.
The most amazing part of this is that I invested twenty minutes of my life watching squirrels defeat an obstacle course
i wish i were a squirrel
PHAT GUS FOR LIFE!!!!!!!!
"Very entertaining, but too much time on your hands!"
I watched this as soon as it realised and I still watched it it today
Nice analysis.
Great videos!!!! It made me gain som respect for these little guys!!!
Test.
You need to help Frank he has a disease
Squrl
birds are my favorite
Just figure out what squirrels are scared of and cover a bird feeder with that
Belated comment of support attempt for team Mark :)
This videos was way better than I expected. Also taught a lot more than I expected and btw frank is so beautiful
This is the best video
You guys really scalped Barbi??!!!
You should make another corse for them! But make it much harder!
Mrs Rober must be a very patient woman.
"14:47 this is the funniest part ""And he's so stoked, he apparently wants to run the whole course in reverse."""
"I am so glad this video has more than 100 million views. It is fun, innovative, skillful, impressive, and joyful. I had a blast!"
did you know this video is actually 20 mins and 20 sec long and this was uploaded in 2020
Is Rick and Marty a Rick and Morty reference
Sounds like Rick and Morty
why didnt they just ascend and T pose to eat the bird feeder?
This is shockingly entertaining.
The big picture question is: are birds worth feeding and squirrels not?
You need a baffle on the pole as well as baffle above.  Pole needs to be high off ground and away from fence.
Nursing moms are hungry
PBS had a film about someone trying to do the same thing. They had all sorts of things in his yard ropes course to entertain himself. The squirrels won everytime
who agrees that the squirell series is like gaurdians of the galaxy
Rivating ... so much more engaging than I thought possible ... Loved it !!!!!!!!!!!! <3
"Squirrels are so amazing. The speed and the smoothness of their movements are more than impressive. And how they can climb and jump so smooth and so fast. Wow just wow.   Nature has a lot of superlatives.
Dragonflies accelerate with up to 30 G force which is about three times as much a human body can tolerate.
And when I watch a spider or a fly crawling on the ceiling as if weight doesn't matter even with speed I'm in awe of mother nature. As if the laws of physics wouldn't apply to them."
Coolest video ever created.
"I thought this video was going to be about a squirrel gym thing, but it was exactly what I was looking for, I had been trying to feed the birds initially, then realized the squirrels like bird food also, so I started feeding the squirrels unsalted peanuts, but they kept eating the bird food, so I bought a bird feeder same thing as to yours the squirrels tore it down, now they are eating everything, I wonder if I put a pole up in backyard that's slippery they cant climb it, you know they are so clever and can move fast why do they run out in the middle of the road and stop then turn and run head long into a moving car? I can't tell you how many times I've slammed on brakes, I just love them thought, wish they could share with birds"
"Wow.  You, sir, are amazing.  Thanks for the great video."
Did anyone notice the squirrel literally did a flip
"Awesome, hilarious great to watch"
Phantastic gus forever
"He started off as a bird watcher, he ended as a squirrel watcher."
"TBH When I found out Phat Gus was pregers, I kinda freaked out by the way she was on her stomach*
*When they were figuring out that walnuts are their favorite*"
That was Great.   Thanks for sharing

Thats one smart squirrel
V...I...R...G...I...N
Love these tails. Great presentation.
I love this video mark love Smart Rick
This is awesome!!
OK- so the answer might be to grease any pole that has a bird feeder?
8:49 i wonder rick and marty inseparable same traits sounds very simmilar to rick and morty
Brilliant!
You should've greased the poles and they would've slipped off and wouldn't have been able to climb up also.
"Hi Mark, how did you make your automatic squirrel feeder? I want to make one for an outdoor cat for when I'm on vacation. One that doesn't necessarily need to be plugged in, as it appears yours isn't?"
Love this video!!!
Great  vid 18:39
Why not just cover the bird post with grease so the squirrels can't climb it.
NASA lost a genius!!!!
"Boy, you sure had fun trying to thwart those intelligent little darlings!"
I sure admire your tenacity! I like the bottle on the pole concept. Perhaps a glass bottle and hose clamps t9 make it work?
11:07 Other dogs watching this video and shaking their heads.
Gnarly dude
"Love your videos, thank you for the laughs !"
This was genius! Well constructed. And amazing to see what amazing skills squirrels has!
I love phantastic gus
Excellent
Fantastic you are my new HERO
"Put hot pepper seed on bird feeder and Squirrel will RUN AWAY ( Squirrels cant Handle Pepper seeds , Birds love pepper seeds )"
Bros video is 20 20 minutes and was made in 2020
"Mark, what camera (brand & model) did you use for this for the night footage on the fence? I get squirrels and opossum in my yard and occasionally I smell skunk. It's been years now, but raccoons were in the area too. I'm curious to see what else might be coming around at night. Thanks!"
And HES pregnant
Very enjoyable.
super super cute ^^
I love squirrels they are so clever lol
This is one of my favorite youtube videos ever!
One of the best videos hes made love your channel.
3:28
1:06 my grandma has that exact birdfeeder
Woke up to this after a nap. Why can't every day be like this? I LOVE IT
mark sue them for false advertisement
All of your videos are so fun it takes an idea and gives it the power of engineering also phantastic Gus is amazing
My favorite troll craft ep
I got a bird feeder that was like the one with the leaf design for my mom and it has worked for years apparently the squirrels aren't smart enough to undo the springs.
"This is the best video ever. Round of applause for not only your ingenious obstacle course skills, but your love of the animal. Great narration. Again. The best video ever."
Make a 4.0 with 20 parts
"Mark Rober for President '24! (I mean it!!! We need this laid back, humorous problem-solver in the White House)"
A pellet rifle works also
Bruh . . . you making the squirrels into  . . . . Marines . . .
POW! Problem solved!!!
What is the best trap to trap your siblings
"Ah, i remeber this video, this is the start of a legendary series"
My daughter absolutely loved your squirrel video. Super  cool!
This all is just because of birdfeed
I showed my dad these and he LOVED cit.but we watched it on ticktok
Great work guys very smooth
My compliment excellent Bill outstanding
He's just making science at this point
"Me in quarantine: fooling around
Mark Rober in quarantine: *BUILDING AN ENTIRE SQUIRREL MAZE*"
i blink faster than 300 miliseconds...
Think outside the box air rifle
Skool
"Just attach a slinky under the birdfeeder, encasing the pole inside the slinky. When they jump on the pole they fall back down to the ground. Every Time!"
This is wonderful .
You can't squirrel proof a bbird feeder.  They just keep making better squirrels.
"Wait...why didn't you just use the slippery pole to begin with? Oooh..but then your video premise is dead. SMH 
Youtubers..."
Pellet guns were invented for this.
Fat Gus  is mu favorite
The best YouTuber
And hi again!!
That course was Incredible! Thanks
Thus was great
Grease that pole.
YES!!
PHAT GUS RULES
"Music, no thanks"
"If they are going to do it anyway, why not get some entertainment out of it!"
He sounds A LOT like the TARS robot from interstellar. the one with the sarcasm setting up
"NASA: Now accepting squirrel applications. 

Squirrels: Nah"
This is a fantastic video!!!!
This is fantastic
Squirrelympics!
"How to make it squirrel-proof:
Build a long pole with a cone on the pole, then put the bird feeder on the top."
"Also, watch how they use their tails as a gyro to help turn in mid-flight."
"This is one of the funniest and cutest things I've ever seen lol.
Here's what happens when a Youtube Scientist gets told they have to stay home lol."
I have resigned myself to accept that the squirrels are part of my bird feeding. I always make sure there's plenty of seeds on the ground so they don't assault the feeder! It's fun when the babies come!
"111 Million views, And No Jokes About Sandy Cheeks  in Comments? Wow."
"Gotta say, squirrels are pretty frickin awesome"
What song is 8:18
The best feeders are the ones that spin around !!
A metal pole connected to a car battery is the best squirrel deterrent ever.
Wow great work and videography! This is absolutely amazing
Mark you never cease to inspire me.
Why not just use the slippery pole in middle of yard..  period but this is fun!
Awesome!!!
Grease up that pole with Vaseline!!! Hahaha squirrels
Someone got stoned and board
It's probably the best thing I saw on YouTube
Watched this video faded so fire
Only the og watched this video in 2021
"Let's feed the birds
Ok
What if we better built a squirrel maze?"
Who else wants be be a squirrel in marks garden
i love how i understand nothing but all untill he does it the simplist way possible
"So very COOL, great job!!!"
rick and morty???
"Omg I loved that! That was the funniest. I like squirrels, too."
Try pecans!  My squirrels love them over any other!
"Wait, could Mark just put slippery stuff on the pole where the bird feeder"
Lol!!!!!!!
My child loved watching this with me. It was so cool to him he wanted to watch it twice. But very nice video
Phantastic Gus identifies as a male now
When that weird bird watching phase in your thirties gets a little out of hand.
So much fun!!!
Cyane pepper powder wont bother the birds but the squirrels cant stand it
"great video, squirrels are so persistent in that if food is involved they don't give up. Its all fun and games until some one gets launched then it is hilarious."
We need a 4.0
Squirrel sitting at a bench is adorable~~
Could have still called her Phat Gus...
"Nailed this video... Loved it 
My wife bought a outdoor plastic box fully sealed to store their nuts finally declaring victory over the Robin Hood's of the garden only to find a week later the secure treasure trove drained of nuts. They just made a hole in the bottom of the far side enough go get in and empty it out day after day. 
Wonderful little creatures"
your illusion didnt work cause they didnt smell it BAZINGA
2:07
so i have to ask.. why do they run back under our tires in the road if they are so agile and smart? I hate seeing them squished on the road
"Truly remarkable.  Both the ingenuity of the course, and skill of the squirrels."
The 3d thing at the end that's cheating buddy.
Rick and Marty totally not Rick and Morty
8:48 there is no way you named him Marty and not morty. Motherf*****
Now you also gotta make a squirrel-proof bird-feeder for us
5:40
Love birds but squirrels are usually more entertaining lol
I feed the birds once a day. And place food for the squirrels by their big tree. My squirrels are not afraid of me.  They are a job to watch along with the birds.
"Can someone tell me why, WHY HE SEARCHED THAT UP????"
Mark should make a quiz/test you can take where you answer questions and it tells you which squirrel you are
More Backyard Squirrel!!!!
Phat gust so funny
This is gold. After 30 repellant videos I see this. You are a rockstar!
Great job
Omg I literally had a squirrel prof bird feeder
Beautiful! Thank you.
Or you could just not have a bird feeder??
0:52 WOW
3:08 I mean
you  need  to  make   the  course   hader       lol
I love these videos!!!
2 years later i just realized that the hologram walnut would've worked with a walnut scent
Hi
Thank you for this wonderful video!
You should of named marty morty because of Rick and  morty
"they destroyed Barbie hair, best vid."
This was as entertaining as it was ingenious and I found it very ingenious!
It's definitely not your first time watching this series.
I am impressed with your work 
Congratulations to all of them at their graduation ceremony.
Can you get a duck and make a maze for the duck
This is Amazing
13:24 this is when I couldn't stop laughing. The sound effects can do that.
I feed the squirrels in my backyard almost daily because I realized over time they will tear apart bird feeders.  I would LOVE to set up something like this to watch them everyday.  So much fun to watch! :D
17:35 down in Ohio swag like Ohio

Squirrels are great! Love them .
My kids are you fans! They have also temporarily morphed into squirrels.

LMDAO!!!
Bruh 2:06
"Wow, now I want to make something for squirrels in my backyard"
Hundreds of hours of YouTube viewing propelled by sheer bordem has given me the authority through experience to authorize this video as the single greatest video of all time.
He started as a bird watcher than turned into a squirrel watcher
2:41 strippers squirrel?!
"This  is my personal favorite on this channel, thank you a lot for putting this much effort into this video. Entertainment at its best!"
E
Mark literally made WIPE OUT but for squirrels
How did you make the squirrel maze?
"Go to YouTube or Google and type in ""how to throw a boomerang"". You are throwing it wrong!"
congratulations on teaching
"Absolutely amazing!! I love squirrels. Thank you for keeping them safe, and letting them have some fun. Kudos to you, I see there are more on your channel and can't wait to watch."
I watched this video over and over again
But... You could just put the feeder on one of those slippery impossible to climb poles....??
Ha ha rick and marty 9:32
you are the best youtuber ever!
I too see they choose the walnut and am very fascinated at they way they do their thing.
"First YouTube video I ever watched, great to come back to it again."

That's amazing
SO EMOTIONAL I'MA SHED A TEAR
We set off to feed the birds but fell in love with the squirrels too.
Ho. At 6:38
"This has to be my third time around watching this video; it is just so amazing to watch these four legged critters go thru your "" amusement park."" They probably had more fun doing this than jumping through their trees since it was so new to them."
If you wanted to make it squirrel proof you would miss out the Ninja course.
To fun!!
13:46  were is Gus junuer

Beautiful house and back yard..

That was so freekin' fun. Thanks!
"Dude, just use a slinky lol"
not only is does this look cool to watch but cool to do maybe ill try
Phantastic Gus is the best squirrel ever change my mind
1:59 it sounds like the birds are swearing at the squirrel
"When I was a kid, my great grandfather has a lake house that we would all go to for the 4th of July. He had a red squirrel named Charlie would come eat pracans out of my grandfather's hand. I had one at am apartment in very urban tulsa where I had a squirrel that would come all the way to my threshold and beg. I trained it with pop tarts. I think I may have given it diabetes."
Awesome. Thanks for sharing.
all i heard at the home record 5:40 is this connects to this witch has this so that it can do this
"This was sooooo wicked!!!!! I loved the squirrel course, I loved the picture booth and like a cherry on top, I absolutely loved the mini picnic table!!!! Everything was off tha hook Mark!!!"

"I love this project but why do you keep calling Gus ""he"" even after finding out she was pregnant?  Probably some of the other ones are female too. Distraction = ""Homewrecker"" as blonde female ...ummmm"
Got a little choked up at the end with the grand squirrel speech part...
WOW!  So interesting and fascinating.  Congratulations on a job well done!
I knew squirrels were smart but this is insane
"im an avid squirrel watcher and the second I saw Phantastic Gus i was like ""pregnant"" lol"

I love ricks tail moves
"Loved this video. Could watch more of your craziness/geniousness. Same thing happened to me. I put out bird feeders.  Squirrels drove me insane. I finally bought huge bags of peanuts, I mean like 10 bags at a time  Put them out at about 7:00 am. Then I got to watch the squirrels on my deck rails shelling peanuts and feasting on the nuts, (what a mess by the way, but really cute to watch them) and watch the birds on the bird feeders.  That's when I learned how many squirrels live in all those trees around my neighborhood.  More than the fantastic four you had.  LMBO.   Gotta love wildlife. And you are dead on.  Squirrels are smart. I ended up having 2 squirrels run from the tree every time I opened the garage door because they learned 2 things.  One, that's where I keep those bags of nuts and two, I was a sucker and would give them extra peanuts.  They would come to the door, sit there and wait until I handed over the goods."
Whoa.. What a video!  My hat is off to the author!
He could've just secured the lid on the first bird feeder lol
"Excellent presentation, and really interesting."
It ain't easy being a squirrel
Amazing! Thank you.
There's a 2.0 and a 3.0 to I think there's a 3.0 idk
Pay some respect to Fat Gus.  He deserves it
"I dont know how it would happen, or why, but this video deserves an Oscar"
"Girl squirrels rule!!  Did she bring her babies to your yard?  Squirrels are intelligent, adaptive, acrobatic and beautiful."
Sponsored by Binford?
why am I crying
"Great stuff, never thought I'd enjoy it as much as I did. Loved how you broke down when they they we're launched, and showed how smart those little brains are. Enjoyed you're Prater match as well. Prayers for #3 Hamlin"
Squirrel like his home outdoors
"Years ago there was a video, probably several, that was called "" Back Yard Bandits"" A lady set up an obstetrical course to see how crafty the squirrels could be after raiding her bird feeders. she made it longer and more complicated as the squirrels figured it out. Turns out a female was the most successful in mastering the course. I haven't seen it for a long time. Like you I love to watch them."
Fat Gus not fantastic gus
Fat Gus is a girl and is pregnet
Crazy how smart they are
"After watching all three parts, Animal Planet or Nat Geo Kids should ABSOLUTELY hire Mark to create a show like this. It is brilliant, hilarious and heartwarming, plus encourages engineering/STEM. Kudos to you. Mark!"
9:47
Super!
"I think that humans should try the way squirrels do it , but it might not be pretty"
Sooooooooooo cute ... Mark rocks with his ideas i could watch this 100x and still laugh
I just realized his crazy it is they do try to go through the parkour and not just flying trough it
this is creative

I despise squirrels. MY maze would make sure they didn't leave alive.
"Another fun one could be a setup like challenge #7, but instead of a mini catapult, it spins 180 degrees  on the horizontal axis if the squirrel stands on the sensor for too long (forcing the squirrel to be dropped off the side with nothing to grip)?"
"Rick and Marty, RICK AND MORTY!"
Any chance you'd share the design to make the squirrel picnic table?  (Or sell it at your store?). It was really cute.  We watch squirrels from our kitchen window.
Make a 4.0
"This begs the question, why do they suck so badly at avoiding cars?"
The squirrels outsmarted you
Those aren't wild squirrels... no way wild squirrels would go through that course. Nice try.
"so some day Fantastic Guss [whom now we know is female] will bring ""His"" grand squirrels back?"
Phantastic Gus being a girl was the biggest plot twist ever
Fab just fab
"I remember my 6th grade science teacher put these type of videos messing with squirrels on the projector, this was always my favorite."
1:56 he definitely earned it
"Spider gus, spider gus, does whatever a spider gus can."
13:46 *HE'S* PREGENANT? DID YOU JUST SAY HE'S PREGENANT?
rick and marty not rick and morty
"Mark rober: is surprised to see that squirrels can go up and down a metal pole
also mark rober: can make poles that squirrels can't climb for and obstacle course"
i love fantastic gus
Hahah
"This is so great, well done!"
"Simply amazing, I sent this to my friends"
So lovely and educational. I love squirrels even though the greys are considered pests over here in the UK.
I feel you need to make a video testing their actual limits
"16:35 tail go ""BRRRRR"""
this made me straight up tear up at the end
Oh my gosh they are so cute
This is probably one of the best YouTube videos I've ever seen. Great job
Superhero fat Gus
I had two large pine trees in my back yard that I spanned a cable between and then put two large circular discs on the cable and hung my bird feeders on the cable between the two circular discs ( picture a pencil with two CDs on it and a bird feeder hung between the two CDs ) anyway. This kept the squirrels at bay for maybe two weeks. Their solution was the climb the tree and throw green pine cones ( the heavy ones ) down onto the bird feeders which would knock the bird seed out of the feeder and then they would go collect it from the ground. Squirrels are no joke.
Just get a longer chain and put some Vasallen on it.
awesome video Mark!!! that was amazing
OMG...I laughed so much.
Phantastic Gus>>>
Fat Gus is a girl :(
"I fought squirrels for a year, at the time I hated it. Now I reminisce on the fun."
phatgusisa mom
I LOVE GUS
:)
How many engineers does it take to outsmart a squirrel ?
"""could i design a bird feeder to deter squirrels?"" Proceeds to create an entire obstacle course and mechanisms"
"I watched this and thought, this is the best video I've seen on youtube :))"
My little ponies
"do you lovwthyedfu,r g+"
Frank is so pretty!
""
"I like how none is talking about Rick and Marty. That sounds familiar, considering the fact that they like to stay together. (Rick and Morty)"
This video is PHAR beyond my expectations!
We need a part 2
dthdfh
INCREDIBLE!!!!   Thank you for making me laugh and for the utter enjoyment. This video is so creative and so well put together. You made my day.
This video exceeded expectations
"I thought I was obsessed, when I drilled holes in corn, and strung them on a thick wire around a poll, to divert them from the bird feeder for a while. lol"
Bonus for anyone if you see the Rick and Morty reference in all of these
squaels are smart and flexalbe
"You  must have a very u understanding wife. I sure e joyed this it was hilarious,  but dialogue  really   made this little drama."
0:15
genious!
"oh my gosh,  we need more squirrel videos <33"
A whole season of squirrel ninja warrior would totally be watched.  Thank you for everything so far.
Fat Gus is a girl he is just pregnant
FAT GUS LOL
How do you make a squirrel noise
Jyytytttttt
loved the video. kinda made me think about how beautiful our life and earth is.
So cute!
I love your books
Congrats Phantastic Gus!
WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Give Sandy cheeks her bird seeds(Just joke
"Marty, more like Smarty"
4:54 is a jacobs ladder for squirels.
"i love how you put so much love and effort on every video you make, kudos mark!"
We should watch it in school its amazing
I love Phantastic Gus so much
"You are a beautiful narrator, story teller, human being."
How do you make a bird proof squirrel feeder
I have several squirrels in my yard and love to watch them play
"phat gus's personal massage...
10:35"
It might be weird but squirrels are surprisingly interesting to watch. They're very smart. I think they actually enjoy these puzzles
this is one of the best videos ive watched
I miss Frank
is no one talking about the missed rick and morty moment?
but then we realised he couldve just put the slippery spray on a normal pole
Dax Shepard sent me here
"""Rick and marty.""
me: *RICK AND MORTY.*"
"I found myself smiling through most of this video. Thank you. I'm curious how your smart squirrels might defeat the ""Yankee Flipper"" feeder. It has a rotating perch that flings off the squirrel when it feels the squirrel's weight. The act of flinging the squirrel can cause seeds to spill on the ground, which the squirrels can then eat, but at least they work for it."
That's awesome. Phantastic Gus is a perfect gymnast
"Lets be honest here


Would Mark actually be sitting on his couch at home and be bored?"
I wonder what happened to Frank...
these squirrels are purely just too cute
Time to become a squirrel
the video was posted 2020 and the video is 20 min and 20 sec lol
"Where can we find that bird feeder, their favorite one with the copper ballast top?"
.
Cute. Funny. So entertaining.  Great job.
The only reason you had a say in the child was because you had to make it
Insert hey ferb meme*
Bro I have my own squirl we can let him out and he comes back around dark they are super smart he runs all over me and and jumps from person to person
You made a brilliant and very entertaining video. Squirrels eat honey badgers for breakfast!
That connects to a thing that connects to another thing that connects to another nother  thing that connects back to the original thing
I never knew squirrels were so smart. Great video!
This reminds me of those shows I used to watch at the Discovery Channel as a kid.
Killer
you missed something quite obvious for the squirrels navigating the catapult.  they use their helicopter tails to stabilize their bodies in the air.  awesome video...and the amount of effort is amazing
"The one thing you missed in the flight physics of the squirrels is the use of their tail, which serves as a stabilizing air brake of sorts, but also conserves angular momentum using centrifugal force. That's using aerodynamics and centrifugal force for making course corrections while maintaining a direction of motion. 

I love my little back yard ninjas."
Squirrels are actually badass xD
nice camp
I love phantastic Gus
Awesome entertaining video!  And...I just buy the hot seed. Nothing better than watching a squirrel eat Serrano pepper coated seed for the first time. They never came back. Heh heh heh
Who knew this series would get an hour long
I like Marty
I want my patonus to be Phantastic Gus
Frank looks so cool :o)
phat guss
18 not 20
I gotta start respecting squirrels more.
did you put all of them
"So if your wife is an animal lover, is she vegetarian? Or even more specific, vegan?"
"Third ""squirl proof"" bird feeder, squirl says ""ha I had a bat for an ancestor a long time ago, nothing upside-down can stop me!"""
Rick and Marty RICK AND MORTY AND THEIR A DUO WHAT
Adorable! And Amazing! Great video!
"All 3 parts are f fantastic. It turns out squerels are smarter than I thougth they are, and they social learn by example so they are some what a borg collective, a swarm mind. Which is similar to what made humans to be humans. Also, I'm now absolutlely not suprised and understand now, in which way an squerrel like animal was an ancestor for all the mammals and where that intelegence learning was born.
Fantastic, no joke, you made me to see!"
Rick and Marty are my favorite squirrels.
Best squirrel video ever! Your cleverness knows no bounds.
You should consider selling this obstacle course as kit? I would buy.
they are adorable
"Tree
Rats?"
PLEASE MAKE A VIDEO ON HOW TO MAKE AN AUTOMATED SQUIRREL FEEDER!!!
Thanks
best vid ever
I love squirrels
loved it i watched it tens of thousand times on my ps4
"have you considered, a bird house that you cant open without a lock and key, magnets, burners, you made all this needlessly, and ramped up your squirrel problem"
9 book
Modification to the original bird feeder: Just put a little clip so that they need opposable thumbs to get the lid off.
Wow these squirrels are smarter than I am
What's the slippery stuff on the poles
I love squirrels so much lol
This vid has to be one of the most brilliant things i have ever seen
I'm so glad this video randomly played such joy! Also how the heck can u tell these guys apart?
Paint me like one of your French Squirrels!!!!
Thank you for keeping us entertained in the lockdown mark
Ama zing
"2 years later, the squirrel series is the best!"
"All my friends call him the crazy squirrel guy. I always say, ""it's Mr. crazy squirrel guy to you!"""
Is there an Academy Award for videos?
Awesome
ok i think this is your most viewed video
I have an idea for a squirrel proof bird feeder.  Have a small dish/tray below the opening to catch food.   In front is a pressure plate built into the landing spot.  It activates the opening to release a bird size serving of food and then close.   The sensor is set to respond to the weight range of local bird species but will remain closed if the weight of a squirrel lands on it.  All solar powered of course.
i like how they wait for their daily rations by sitting
7:00 omg
"Amazing video!  I have been trying to figure out how to make my feeders squirrel proof, but after watching this video...  I gave up!"
"You are amazing, and the squirrels are amazing.  Well done!"
Why do I imagine Phantastic Gus POV fanfiction stuff now?
This was an absolute delight to watch
Love your work  thank  you
phantastic Gus Oh i love me a phantastic gus
i know cats land on their feet but not my cat kiki
AWESOME VIDEO!
Me when i releazed Rick and Marty was Rick and morty
"Squirrel may outsmart obstacle but can squirrel outsmart 
Bulet"
Ong this vid is better then every video he made
hi I'm Mrs squerl
"CC: ""Fat gus"" Real: ""Phat gus"""
"CC ""It's a squirrel pulse"""
Phat Gus a girl
@2:07 make me laugh. The squirrel was like f u
Anyone knows the song at 08:32?
Dude ur so creative at these builds. Squirrels are just so skilled!
"fun fact frank is a one in 10,000 squirrel"
I hope this video doesn't pass your sacred first big hit with the watermelons :(
19:18 FAT TAIL
Just in sult the squeerls just make a sign saying fa.. off squirlls
"What if he made the pole holding the bird feeder slippery, so the squirrels couldn't climb it"
This series has to be some of my absolute favorite stuff on the web hands down!!! GO PHAT GUS!!!!
Mark would never believe that he will in the future make squirrel olympics
CALL HIM PHAT GUS AGAIN
it went from ninja warrior themed to oceans eleven theme and finally olympics themed
You just ript a barbie hair and added to a squirrel plush
When you realize feeding squirrels is illegal in California...
13:34 Thats disturbing
This is so funny.  I have squirrels in my yard.  I love watching them play and they do eat at my feeders.   I'd love a course like this in my yard.  LOL.  So many funny things.
"I live in a condo, second floor.  However, stucco walls.  I thought I could put nuts on the window sill for the blue jays.  Nope.  I took 2 days, and the squirrels started climbing up the side of the building.  That ended that."
Did Rick get renamed augustine?
'paint me like one of your french squirrels'. Lmfao
And now Mark made an Olympics for these guys
I cant believe it has already been 2 years
frank needs more credit
I have the bird feeder with the leaves that cover up the holes for the seed when the squirrel goes on it
1:53  ahhaha
Rick and marty
amazing
Episode 3 just came out today so I am rewatching the first two episodes this is my favorite series
Rick and Marty. Ha that's phantastic
I understand its content for viewers but why couldn't of you just put the sticky stuff on the pole so the little guy couldn't climb it and then it would be squirrel proof
WHERE IS FRANK
The problem solving skills from the squirrels is surprising
