this is extremely dangerous the anchor could fall on your head haha
Bahubali can stop that
How effective would the hardhat be in any emergency scenario here?
Yea i can bench dat
I want to see this catching it
realmen
The chain looks half the size of a human.
imagine being a fish and a giant anchor comes out nowhere and slams you to the ground
That stuff looks heavy.
"work's dangerous, stay safe."
Not dangerous if you know what your doing and follow your procedures and safety rules.
"UDANG 
dani wadezig"
Only dangerous if you ride the chain down.
We not talking abt the fact this is on super car blondies channel?
"U.S.S. John F. Kennedy CV-67, 75' Med Cruise (I think) we lost our bow anchor overboard in Agusta Bay Sicily. Recovered, returned, reattached (stateside)."
Ese Ships Necesita 1Millon De galones De gasolina
Now that's an anchor
ALL anchor drops are dangerous.
My bath plug
A careful great flange.
I wanna see it get cranked back up
Especially when there is a brake.  A stopper release is very dangerous.
"Hey dude, it's your turn to hammer the pin release"

This is the most random video for this channel

WOW !
Nice
why the hard hats bird gonna shit on you lol
Interesting 6K or daily earning 400 to 500 best treding
Seems kinda abrasive . Why isn't there a roller the chain rolls over ?
one of the greatest invention of man
It reminds me spiderman wen shootor
That's nuts
Please I need modern westernize women to sign up for this job. Remember we are equal and we deserve equal pays right?
"On another YouTube video dealing with the same subject, there was a 560,000. ton cargo ship with the largest anchor ever made at 17 tons. He said even such an anchor can not hold such a ship in place. It just engages boulders or whatever and Is meant to resist currents/winds. What  holds the ship in place is the steel cable played out at 3 - 5 times as long as the ship is tall (I believe he meant to the deck). That's a sincerely formidable weight."
Why don't you just commonly lower it down instead of doing this
"I dare you to put your finger in there ""intrusive thoughts said"""
"It looks like an anchor drop to me.  From a boat, on the extremely dangerous ocean."

How they pull is up?
Anchors away
Drop dhyorfec. Oftod
That's great job
See. Instead of the anchor they should have joined the clip from pirates of the Caribbean where Jack had a rope grab his leg and drag him through town.
Barely touch that and your dead instantly
When she say it's her first time
Imagine if you got stuck and dragged into with the chain
Keren
"Damn, I thought my job was dangerous"
How do you pick it up then
For what this is used for??
"General speaking, in the case something goes wrong (like the anchor moving too fast) make sure to grab hold of the chain and hold onto it as tight as you can to help slow down the rate of decent. Hope this helps !"
Thats why the man wuth white hat is in there his the safety engineer but this job is so dangerous there is a video of this that killed people in youtube
"mantap
https://www.youtube.com/@orangpinggiran2356"
me putting a gold chain on
the girth...scary
They chain at first looks massive and then looks tiny compared to the anchor
waw ide yg bagus
It's called a precision anchor drop cause the release is faster than backing off the brake. Its something the Navy trains to and does frequently with tons of safety instruction and oversight.
What if it's been unlocked? When it's pulled using a new key?
Okay but how to pull it up now
Imagine keeping you hand
freefall
Pak eta rantena gede amat
No fish are harmed in dropping the anchor....but fred the fish saga.....
asalam mualaikum sodara Qu

"Is that chain pad made of concrete, Teflon, or what?"
Where the women at? Feminists? Where you at? Should fight for equality here.
Ahhhh all that lovely smelling rust

Wow
Bro thats not even dangerous
This never stops being cool to me. And satisfying
How do you pull it back up
The poop in the morning
Name of the ship please
Luar biasa mad

Get hit my that your done fore
Damn
"Yup. It is dangerous. Someone I knew, died because he stood on the spot where he was not supposed to be. A cable just whipped him off."
Mmm hm yes yes it is in the water...
Why don't they use a winch with gears and brakes like merchant ships
"Definitely this is a old way of anchoring, nowadays they have windlass equipment, which does in controlled manner"
Wow amazing
"Yep, it fell right on that boat below, no chance of them boarding us now..."
"and an underwater dweller said "" the sky had a baby"""
How it was pulled back
"Cant imagone how much coral and sealife were destroyed

Everytime that hunk o shit was lowered"

"The thing is, how the f@$k do they get the anchor back up?"
erm it hasn't hit the bottom yet... that's not good we're running out of chain sir
So dude looks over the side to make sure the anchor was going in the water?  Where did he think all that chain was going?
Imagine breathing in a plume of that rust. Id just hop over board and accept my fate
So then how do you un anchor it again?
"He is ""anchry"".."
Not really dangerous unless your a complete Mong and have no sense of your surroundings
Good idea to wear a dust mask.  Rust dust comes up in the air when doing that work.
You are going to die. I am going to die. We are all going to die. just not today.

The first one was much longer than the second one
"Fake video the first part is real and the second part is real, but they are not the same ship"

Looks cgi
"This a standard safe anchor drop evolution in the Navy, not really dangerous.  The sailors were trained, and safeties were all in place to ensure that no one was injured."
Wow that was impressive
"Anchor shot!

My granpa holding his sh!t since in ww2:

"""WAIT!  MY KEYS!"""
It would take 2 men to lift 1 link of that chain
Klo kena bisa mati tuh
No there is 2 sections with white replacement parts.. don't they get it rig?
"Watch the video again,.  When the anchor falls in notice there is a white replacement linh.... Did it break once?"

This chain can cut u into pieces.
Experienced Chief Mate along with skillful Bosun is essential.
"Hey ""WHITE HAT"", never ever turn your back to the chain!"
Bbbuuut you should put supercar as anchor
Can such small anchore stop such a big ship?
"HEY, WAIT A MINUTE!!!!! WHERE'S THE WOMAN ON THIS JOB?!?!?"
Rightly said.
Go ahead and hold that chain back...it's going to fast
Only 1 shackle off deck? What happened to 3 by power n 4 by gravity?

The chains looked so CGI
"""Because God wanted to make the unchanging nature of his purpose very clear to the heirs of what was promised, he confirmed it with an oath.God did this so that, by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled to take hold of the hope set before us may be greatly encouraged.We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure. It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain,where our forerunner, Jesus, has entered on our behalf. He has become a high priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek."" - Hebrews 6:17-20"
Felt like I slipped off the ship and got crushes

I dunno about you but shit breaks in this world allllll the time i wouldn't be standing anywhere near that massive chain like that guy... little helmet and faceshield won't do anything lol
What would be the temper of the chain lock clip
"Good job

It's only dangerous if you're dumb enough to stand in the way
Wonder how much each link weighs
New fear unlocked
Can they take this chain later?
me in toilet:
(Captain) Sorry to inform you but we are not moving
How do they take back ?
What's the use?

I've always wondered doesn't that damages the ship ?
Man muss finger dazwischen tun
Lower to the chain cabel. We used by winch.After than break by tides. We will see position. Open the break &  drop the anchor. SAFETY FIRST.
"That's the easy part, it's pulling it back up ."
The anchor is extremely strong it could literally smash your meat to death if it droped to you
NICE
Be careful

"This is why men run the world...If you ain't willing to die, it doesn't matter."
Yeah poor fishes just minding their own business swimming along and someone drops a anchor on your head
And how they push again?
What do u guys do if it needs to that pull back?
"Natasha Romanoff: ""gentleman, you might want to step inside in a minute. It's going to get a little hard to breathe.""
(Workers start to drop the anchor)."
Seems cheaper to have the rotating thrusters keeping you in one area of the water  that heavy chain and anchor will get caught on something below the water and the rest of the boat will still move around the area  too much potential for problems
What happens when the anchor gets stuck below the water

This has no relation to a supercar or a blondie. Disappointed.

"I think it is fair and equal for women to work in such jobs and take the same salary as men in such a job and the same number of hours will feminism agree to this job? We all know the answer to that is why we always and never say equality is a lie that will not be achieved at all. The reason is clear the biological differences between men, women and the tasks required in life in general and the role of women in pregnancy, which is what men cannot do, as well as the difference of mind, feelings and behaviors now I will say a statement that belongs"
Leagend will say it is AC 14
So much rust!
If you keep on doing that that will cause the chain to break it will snap off and then you stuck out in see
"The ship: ""Ahh, that was a big one-"""
Ok
it looks like graphic
Id just grab it 1 handed and stop it where i want to

Why should they did it like that when they can drop anchor using winch. More safer.
Only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.

Anchoring is one of the hardest part of ship operation.  One mistake and you lose yr anchor and chain. Looks easy to bystanders but for the captain it takes a lot of nerves
