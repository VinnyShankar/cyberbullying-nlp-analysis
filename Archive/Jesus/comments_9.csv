Eurofighters German too. Its a shared project
"Should try again with the Chiron, It would probably do it."
"The silliest, most enjoyable competition"
We need a rematch with the Rimac Nivera
The greatest Air Force in the world up against the best car in the world on the best car show in the world!  There can only be one winner!!
"This was Hammond's first time on super cars after his near fatal jet car crash. This was one of the biggest things on TV history, still is a legendary thing to do on TV"
that's a cute little plane.
In order for the plane to go 1 mile horizontally ..its doing 3 miles vertically.
The cinematography is incredible on this one. I remember seeing this the first time at my local bar on silent TV while Whatever You Want by Tina Turner was playing on speakers. I think it was a great soundtrack for this clip.
2:45 my boi looking intimidating as hell.
"My friend, it is normal for a warplane to win, rather it is not normal for the plane to lose. This video or others are just to show the possibility of the plane that challenges the greatest and fastest cars and in order to show the military strength of the state and to intimidate opponents, and to profit financially from the views, in all sincerity a great idea  , but I don't care, I enjoyed in watching the video.  Thank you for reading the comment."
Top Gu- er Gear!
Please watch Indian MIG29 vs Lamborghini. It's much more interesting.
"you know, i was a bit hesitant first on which to buy, but i think im convinced now to get the euro fighter instead"
now put it up against the chiron
Jet wasnt even allowed to go over 1100 km haha
"6, 2023 every one"
Fun fact the plane only going half of its speed
Come on this jet vs car !
Is no one gonna mention that Hammond's helmet has a hamster on it???
That's the same Veyron Clarkson drove in the Italy to London race.
Will buy jet car
So it's 1500 mph. The Americans who flew to intercept the tic-tacs took 20 mins at top speed then the tic-tacs flew back to the jets starting point in less than two minutes...out of this world.
Ah yes. The years when Hammond looked like my mum in a suit and jeans
"Hammond, U should let this to Jeremy..... Speeeeeeeed"
Loving the model Concorde. They really should have done a race with concorde on top gear it would have been amazing
Weight doesn't matters when you have power.
"BBC stopped broadcasting this show due to its biasing and  racistic attitude, did they ?"
veyron smokes by Kawasaki ninja H2r.
such a fun and silly show!!
Next time do Lotus Ejava VS Cessna
What the music name at the end ?
"3:35 the Eurofighter from Maisto Tailwinds and the Hot Wheels Veyron: are we joke to you?

I know the Veyron is kinda hard to find but How Wheels is more commercial than Siku, Kyosho, Auto Art, Tomica. . ."
"this is wrong , no englishman has ever fought for germany"
amazing
And now think that in 2023 we have bunch of cars that can smash Veyron...
Best drag race EVER!
I was confused between buying a Bugatti Veyron vs Euro Fighter. This video cleared my mind thanks. I shall rather use my bicycle. Thanks.
This show was my childhood
Uzaygemisi Enterprise ile de bekliyoruz .
Who remembers watching it live? :)
outstanding
It's very impressive when you can take a military and make shit like that with them
F35 and typhoon are such an attractive couple! About time we had the return of some sexy military gear back in the ranks!
Utter rubbish
"Try the Chiron vs the Typhoon.  Veyron is old, now try it's successor"
'A plane that climbs like a homesick angel' !
"Bugatti: ""I'm doing 196 mph, but is it enough?""               *It wasn't*
Eurofighter: ""I'm doing 596 mph, but is it enough?""        *It was*"
Is it a very fat audi TT?
"""I suspect I may get some abuse for this"""
Anyone saw the chicken running for its dear life
That shot of the Typhoon reversing direction into the descent is so damn cool. Perfectly placed.
"Bugatti do the same races in Russia against their top strike fighter. These stunts serve to promote not only the car maker, but also sell the public the idea of patriotism for their military. Propaganda is to recruit support for war, and naive people lap it up and then pay for it in taxes. People are mostly too stupid to see how they are used."
https://youtube.com/@OnTheRoadWithb
Awesome
4:11 back in the good old days when you could call somebody a vegetarian as an insult...
"6:18 to 6:20 I- am speechless.
edit: the chicken or something i dont even know!!! wth boi"
Top Gun vs. Top Gear!
2023 anyone?
Cul
"Its nit a cutting egde plane, its a cutting edge death machine"
Eu fighter typhoons are anger...
German production line like great car innovation of world..
"EURO fighter like a cross between the saab viggen and the mirage , gorgeous"
Holy shit i remember watching this about 12 years ago
Zj82 what? What's the aircraft reg?
"Till this day, Hammond is vegetarian"
So epic
bro really called the eurofighter more advanced than the f-22 or f-35
this video is older than me
Eurofighter is german btw
oh my god i cat imagine that this kind of things exist but is awesome
"Richard: i must be ahead I can't see the plane
*Hears* beep beep"
This remains the greatest race of all time. The fact that the car was that close to the Typhoon is impressive
"As a student pilot, I say this is the best race I've watched. Huge respect to the pilot as well!"
"I totally didn't know who would win







C,mon guys fighter jets go above 1000 mph"
"""If I lose this I might as well get a paper route""

He got a paper route"
This is one of the most satisfying race for me.. how time flies. 14years ago
wow this was 14 years ago?? no wonder the quality was so bad lol
"""The most modern, the most hi tech strike fighter plane on the planet"" **Cough cough F22 first took flight in 1997 and can take on 5 F15's cough cough**"
"That plane travels more than 2 miles, by the time it takes off, it's done half the runway. I reckon at least 5 miles, to the car 2."
Actually the car was going well but again we know all why it lost
"FX 26 2,8tonnes  in  the Airplane 13tonnes fuel under .....Ali!"
"620kg 440kg Engines 720kg 3engines!real Eurofighter engine920kg Is for 17meter jet ca see 4series lenght!

"Everything was.........better, more beautiful back than."
Try it with a Chiron instead. Maybe it can win.
Next video: F1 Vs Bicycle
"Wer nur einmal einen Kampfjet flog, verlor jedes Interesse an ""schnellen"" Autos."
"I would love to direct all viewers of this video to this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsZF0B2ssYI&ab_channel=GrowlingSidewinder
Don't worry, the fight only lasted for about a minute."
Veryron was the pinnacle of Bugatti
"nowadays, we got the F35-B, try and beat that monster!, oh, and the Concorde."
The Veyron was ahead of it's time. What a gorgeous machine.
I would like one of  each please. WOW
https://youtu.be/zBGwuSjLuEk
"I love the attitude of Bugatti.
We have the most expensive cars.
Let's send two of them to race a fighter jet"
Just badass
Hammond hasn't had much luck with drag racing and jet engines.
I think in air there will be much difference
"why no fox3, could hv easily ended the race"
Love the phoon but the F-15E strike eagle still ownes the sky.
Next: Space Shuttle vs Speedwagon.
You should do a civic vs bus race
He should of had some Nitrous.
Only about 3 seconds in it
This was 14 years ago bugatti must b upgraded n faster now
No matter the supercar or hypercar you're using all of them are going to lose against next gen military tech
this is a big downgrade from the f35
it was like watching a falcon come down for a rabbit
Greatest drage race in history but filmed in 360p
Guess imma buy EURO FIGHTER then....
"Bugatti sent 2 Verons just in case Hamster smoked himself to ash in one of them, then Stig could race the other one."
The car is literally like a toy for the Airstriker ;)
I wonder how many miles the plane actually did. It certainly wasn't 1 mile up then 1 down.
Good   Job  (^^)/
What colour is your Eurofighter?
Classic
greatest bit of telly ever
Little did we know that this was going to be the golden age of Top Gear.
Tates probably angry
Pilot :- i am a devil at my work
1001km/h at.. ..... Bugatti?
The uk is actually a joke now
"I really miss this show, the original one, and these guys too. Amazing TV show, favorite one ever."
i remembered they did it with McLaren F1 vs jet like 20 years ago and F1 was ahead for the first 2 seconds as well then the jet took over
Next will be Mia Khalifa vs Danie Daniels...
Veyron is such an ugly car.
A new Hud system and much more!
6:18 race start
"-Super cars when they reach 350 mile/hr:
""OMG the stress, Did I won!?""
-Jets when they reach 350 mile/hr:
""Ok that's enough warm up, let the race begin."""
Watching this in 2022 hits different
I would do ANYTHING to fly a Typhoon
Actually the typhoon goes 600mph
GAS GAS GAS
Chiron?
"I couldn't choose wether to buy a Veyron or an Euro Figher. 
Thanks to this video, I have decided to buy an Euro Figher.

Edit: CAN SOMEONE BUY THE EURO FIGHTER FROM ME I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DRIVE IT"
8:37 That moment the pilot go to Heavan 
"This is, by far, the coolest thing to ever happen in Television history."
im sorry did he expect to win?
"Revisiting this classic battle which we saw over and over when it dawned on us: wouldn't the plane have the additional advantage of Gravity pulling it back down to Earth with increasing velocity, where the car would have rolling friction to deal with??"
I am with family Bugatti AND euro fighter family
Chiron 300 + will avenge .
Soviet mig  is far better
"5,7 seconds to 100? my car does it in 4,9 seconds"
Somes watching 2022 to 2000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000050000000000000
Moment where *Top Gear* has becoming *Top Gun* in a few minutes
andrew tate vs maverick okay I like this shit
"""If you're watching thinking this is cool, it is!"" -Boom!"
Wooow
The flight got the gravity advantage when returning. But HATS OFF for executing it in 2008
I like the victory roll. M.
The climb rate on eurofighter is so sick.
fighting between hundreds of thousand and tens of millions...lol
Who on his right mind let hammond drive the most expensive car ever?
"The best is, the licence plate from the Bugatti is from my hometown. Power on!"
We need a bolide vs jet
anyone in 2022?
"In France, we did the same with a Chiron and a Rafale"
6:25
This is why Top Gear is the best car show in the history
The dude forgot gravity forces for a fighter jet before planning for such an event
we miss OLD TOP GEAR !
the day will come when a car will win against a jet... someday for sure...
incroyable
Bugatti Veyron vs Euro Fighter | Top Gear | Series 10
Can they have RC CAR vs a Jet???
"Bugatti is to heavy, try a Koenigsegg insted."
ok who thought that the fighter was gonna lose to a car
Lo veo en 2022 y es sumamente epico
Wowq
13 years old today
How fast can you go?
The sheer madness made this show a legend
Now try it with the Chiron Super Sport 300+.
You might be able to recreate this but with a super sport instead
That was epic
"I wonder if there's anything the car world has come up with since that would stand a better chance? I'm not that knowledgeable on planes but I'm assuming the typhoon is still in service? What if it went up against a Chiron, Venom F5, or any of the 2000hp EVs?"
"It is just...beautiful. Pure engineering at its finest, It made me cry a bit...."
Euro fighter vs f22???
These need to be reuploaded
The testosterone level of these Pilots have got to be off the charts
Wow I'm a woman but I really felt a boner
"Although i come back to this legendary vid and i love it so much, the f-22 is more modern and high tech tbh"
hi
#
Turns out Euro Fighter is Carnivore after all.
6:15 thank me later
TGear vs TGun
4:00 Was that model plane he was holding a Concord?
"3:11
""maybe they're gonna tie them down together or something""
Richard Hammond 2008"
"Only on top gear: they race the fastest car in the world with a fighter jet, i hope they race a Shinkansen in the next season"
typhoon was never the most advanced fighter...
Every couple of years they do these car vs jet things. Car has never won
What an awful car
It was impressive that a car came anywhere close
Hamster has James old clothes on
"Was the video quality always this bad

I remember watching this and it looked crystal clear"
The newer episode where they race the McLaren speed tail vs the F-35 Lightning just shows how much technology has moved on in 13 years!
"Richard Hammond : I'm getting away !! I can't believe I'm looking in
Pilot : Spoke too soon my friend"
3:10 goes so hard
They did this race again but with a McLaren Speedtail vs. F35 Jet.
"Best 4th gen fighter and the best looking fighter jet in my opinion. Especially after the upgrades named FGR4. With the meteor missile and its new sensors and radars and jammers... Eurofighter Typhoon is a masterpiece. Well done designers, well done... I cant believe this is protecting the UK skies. Who needs a 5th gen fighter when you have this beast. 100miles range for its missiles and can basically ""see"" everything beyond-visual-range (BVR)... Ohh forget to mention that the Meteor missile have a speed of mach +4 and the plane itself have a peak speed of mach +2 ... Beast of a fighter jet and a very good race. Lets try again with a newer Bugatti. Like the Chiron or with the Bugatti Divo."
Is this the same track the Mclaren raced the F35?
"I apologize if I seem Disrespectful to Top Gear Nor The Channel however I'm a huge fan of Airplanes, cars, and I am a huge Fan of Brittish Engenerring."
I'm being a negative nancy
Did they update it from the Sherome?
Unless I'm wrong on the date
The veyron isn't as fast as the Shorome I'm over it.
That Veron took one for the Supercars
Byggatti Veyron mojet 700 km/h
if the plane turns so its flying straight down isnt it basically falling out of the sky
lessoned learned: jet is always going to be faster then a car
"""I don't see the plane, I may still be ahead!""

*latin music intensifies*"
"Look it was never gonna beat a jet, but seriously the buggati wasn't far behind. What a machine buggati!!"
keep coming back to this extremely ferociously epic and unforgettable episode!
"Mmm let's see the Euro fighter makes the equivalent horsepower of about 200,000... The beautiful Bugatti makes slightly over 1000...."
Greatest show: top gear. Greatest movie: top gun. This episode: both
"Imagine the Wright brothers stepping into the Typhoon. Heck, even seeing it would blow their minds."
Brilliant xx
6:16 to skip to the good part
I was confused between buying eurofighter typhoon and bugatti.This video clear my mind thank.I Shall rather use my bicycle
On the ground no comparison of buggati.
ostia que leche de vidio
if it was bolide vs it it would probably win the race
"_One has the land and roads as his kingdom, the other has the skies, high up in the clouds and beyond._"
How did Hammond not crash the Veyron?
Hammond: i was doing a 196 miles and hour but was it enough?
That pilot must have felt badass xD
"'This machine really is the cutting edge of what a plane can do..'

*laughs in F22*"
No words! Just wow!
Can someone find me this music ??
"which was  not recorded at last the jet emptied all it's ammo on that innocent car 







how silly as the Chiron"
"I drove my Nissan Micra up to 30,000 feet in 13 seconds....yeah, really...just like the Typhoon it accelerates at 35MPH/Sec...10 seconds later I was doing over 350MPH...didn't see any other cars though"
This show is basically what happens if you gave an 8 year old boy an unlimited budget lol. I love it.
7:18 that down shift sound
"sigh, modern variants of the typhoon have strike capability, but this is primarily an air superiority fighter not a strike fighter..."
Bugatti chiron vs Falcon 9 self landing rocket next
This is the best race in history! Richard Hammond was right. Still holds true!
"Who was taking the outside video takes of the plane when it was a mile high above the clouds, another jet or how did they shoot that?"
prety sure that the most advanced strike aircraft 13 years ago was the f35 not the euro fighter.
I really can't wrap my head the money this guys spend on jet fuel and in putting all this together just to entertain us. From the bottom of my heart I say thank you @topgear
"Everybody: America has the weirdest measurement system!
British people: these wings can hold up to 35 Volkswagen golfs."
I really miss the show
I miss thus show
'Last one to finish is a vegetarian'.. he would be cancelled in a minute these days.
Made to kill
planes are way faster muahahahhaahhHHAHHAHAHAAHAHBHAHAHABFEHbguoybiuwg4e322
Thats alot more than 1 mile high!!!
the loser is a vegetation lol
Can it win a H2R KWASAKI?!
"i could afford the air valve cap, and that's about it"
Rare that the Bugatti is the less expensive one
The Camera man is more faster
The coolest thing I have ever seen
The jet starts shooting
This is how real men have fun!
The best race ever.
"I'm convinced if you put a chiron vs that jet the chiron would win it ""with a better driver of course LOL"""
"""I suspect I may get some abuse for this."" For holding your own in a race against a FIGHTER JET? Hell no!"
i guess richard there hasnt heard of the sr-71 black bird
"I'm not so sure about this. The car definitely completed the full distance but with the plane it's a bit confusing. It left the runway about a quarter down the runway and then went 1 mile upwards, so about 1.25 miles before its descent. On its descent it crossed the finish line but at an 'unknown' altitude....so maybe it was 2 miles but I think it might have been just under. Am I right in thinking that it only would have completed the full distance if it crossed the line at ground level?

Your thoughts?"
Pagani huayra pls
"At this day and Age
There's MO WAY
That the fastest car available on earth that only drives on the road 
Can defeat in a race of SPEED a
Euro   Jet Fighter With Mach 2 Speed that is flying  in the Air!!!"
"bugatti veyron vs alpine 2022








trust the plan"
What a car. What a plane. What a race.
"Fighter Jet always win. Next time, try with other vehicles. Never challenge planes!"
"Was it fair? Not really, was it fun? Yeah it was, it really was."
What a bummer. Condom?
One of the most epic drag/air races is history of cars and planes/jets. Simply amazing.
Hammond ruined the car's reputation by becoming a vegetarian
I wonder if they used literally the same veyron in all 3 challenges.
"Nice pilot skills, and for a change, Hammond didn't end up in a cast :O Take the joke, idiots!!! :P"
Both of  these 2 ultimate speed machines are masterpiece
The pilot has 9g in the take off
wow that was fast
Nice a bugati
"6:05
thank me later"
GOOD
"i just can imagine how many G's that dude had to embrace.. in that bugatti.. lol.. but srsly tho going that steep with a jet for 1mile, this dude could be astronaut easily"
You still to slowly not faster enough yet Euro Fighter is the best more then you
The Euro fighter effortlessly majestic and ruthlessly menacing all at the same time.
God bless America
"""The last one to finish is a vegetarian. As simple as that."""
Man I love the Eurofighter!! What a bird!
This is just a showcase event in Forza Horizon. But the car loses.
Watching this every now and then is a tradition
"The plane lost for sure, if he didn't come down at an angle like he did, or had a altitude rule (Notice how high he was up) he wouldn't have won.  Still an awesome race, but I'd have asked for a rematch!!"
Watching in 2021
Jjjjjjjjjjjiiiiiiiojjihobohp prohibits 7
you cant drive
anyone know the name of the music at 1:31? old top gear used to love playing it a lot in their episodes
Oh my god
F35 vs speedtail is for boys. Euro fighter vs Bugatti is for real men
Fazer um carro agora pra bater de frente com um jato
I remember watching this on release as a kid. Still got the same chills today I did back then
Alternate title: German car races german aircraft
pottente!!!!!!
We gotta respect the veyron tho. Any other car in its place would have looked like it's not moving at all.
Germans+French vs the raf
Love those shots of the Typhoon at the end <3
"In a way, the plane cheated as it was aided by gravity on the descent. Of course, it had to fight AGAINST it on the first half. Another similar race had the participants takings TURNS instead of the plane going straight up. Thrilling, nonetheless!"
Dont figth with fighter jet
And now we're using golfs instead of tons or kilograms
I love how Hammond is literally allowed to stand on the wing while the new guys were stopped 10 metres away from the F-35
"Youtube: Wanna see a comparison between a fighter jet and a sports car
38 Million People: Yes, Interesting"
One Day before I was borned
Now do this with a Chiron
wow i remember watching this when i was a little kid
actually still the best episode of topgear
Now do this but with a Model S Plaid
yes
6:18 Who else noticed the rabbit running across the side of the runway?
I am unsure how many times I have watched this and yet everytime it feels like the first time I have watched it with all the excitement. Damn I miss the old Top Gear
"It's amazing.
From M B"
How can a person fly does jet?? The airplane run fast in my heart rates increase imaginate been on the jet i will pass out
3:33 thats funny how he used an concorde instead of an eurofighter
"now, remake this with chiron super sport and the same jet. please make it happen."
That's what fast and furious be like in 2024
"6:40
Fighter plane : That's cute"
"- So what's your budget for the next episode?
- Yes."
And you tube is recommending this to me after 13 year in 2 October 2021
"How can a car win against a plane that could go at 2,2k KPH"
Bugatti did well
How much hp does that jet make on pump?
7:30 That hammerhead
epic
"Well, if the Veyron HAS to lose to something.... then the Fighter Jet is quite a worthy winner! Totally understandable."
As a car and aviation nut I love seeing these challenges
"Well also the euro fighter is a German plane, so Germany vs germany"
Even with all the handicaps they gave the plane it still won lol
360P is all I need
nice 29r squadron
"The Veyron barely lost, the CHIRON would win this race!!!"
"idk who to root for, this is like choosing between my kids"
Like a car could actually beat a jet lmaoo
Now... Taking out tanks & radar installations.... Who wins?
I was confused between buying a eurofighter and Bugatti.this video cleared my mind. I shall rather use my cycle.Thanks
Will the bagatti ever be on electric
I wonder the outcome if they used a Kawasaki H2R instead. A Typhoon might lose that one.
3:36 you are holding a concorde model
8:19 what's the background music anyone please
6:31
Regardless it was damn close!
Autobot vs Decepitcon
"when you watch this on Sky with you're grandparents and haven't watched it since the new guys came.
Miss the OG's"
The game was over when the plane took off.
"like to see what modern hyper cars would hold up, vs modern 5th gen fighter planes."
this is a testosterone rush at its finest.
F1 car would have most likely beet the typhoon
Maybe they are going to tie them together or something
SuPrA sTiLl WiNs
This is up there with the 50th Anniversary of the E-type Jaguar episode.

"A bunch of aviation enthusiasts called "" RAF""! Britisch humor, really like it!"
Bugatti beyron

"7:47 Hammo, how's the new paper round?"
Whos here by 2021
I love jet fighters speed.
I guess we need a faster car
2:04 I don't know why but that one fact gives me goosebumps
RAF Pilot Stigs Big Brother
"I'm proud to say that I watched this the day they aired it on Tv... Top Gear (2002 BRITISH TV series) is never the same without Clarkson, Hammond and May..."
Epic
The climbing a mile is super easy the longest that will take is takeoff
A bloody 1960s jet would beat the veyron!
I love the fact that suck an epic video isn't even HD but still looks absolutely insane

Need a redo with the Chiron SS vs a Rafale M.
After 12 years it's a battle between Bugatti Chiron super sport vs  Dassalt Rafael yaa !
But how about the chiron
Who cares if you lose in the bughatti you still have a bughatti
"loser is vagan, so winner is what... cannibal?"
this is the best race ever in the history of TOP GEAR..... i loved these guys... top gear will never be the same without them
coolest thing i have seen on yt or tv frickin  awesome
I don't know why they continue to race a car against a jet. It will always lose. It's pointless.
"Bugatti Veyron legendary car , really like never seen something like this since very time"
Your voice sounds like Paul Mc Cartney but younrger voice     ;)   ;)
BUGATTI.
A great display of engineering from both the car and jet
Skip to 6:00
8:03 game over
What's your thing?
Game Over...
Wow! I was just contemplating which one I should buy!! Thanks for the advice. I think I'll use my bicycle instead.
This is a top spec production right in our eyes
I just saw the legendary and famous hare that watches planes and cars race
Ofcourse the cars are better but the only thing change is speed.
6:25 for the race
RAF beat zee germans
Best memory of my childhood
I feel the need..the need for speed!!!
12 years later and is still as cool as it was
Gota love these guys
well done
We all knew that the jet was obviously gonna win but here we are expecting a miracle to happen
"Bugatti : sounds brrrrrrrrrr..... 
Jet : that's cute !"
"next time, Honda BRV vs MiG-31"
"Though a great video to watch, but these jets are made to travel across countries in a couple of hours, maybe less. Still cool to watch though."
Oh come on  the plane didn't even break mach 1
Who on earth is gonna race a jet it's more way faster u people dumb or what it's like racing a car with a truck who's way more faster car or truck the car it has more way to win the car is low n truck is like a box if u really know about racing u should know don't be smart enough to do this again who on earth is doing this be honest
13 years already this video. Still happy to watching

"I'm fighting for the Germans

I want to see a Chiron vs the Euro typhoon
This was soooooo cool to watch. I'd give my left nut to race either one ;-)
"Well, but don't forget that there is much difference between a flying hawk and a running ostrich."

How fast this time passed. I watched this when i was around 9 10 years old. now im 21
12 year's back
6:52 holy smokes that shot was freaking cool
"id like a rematch but this time the jet doesnt move, deal???"
*10 years later Chris Harris races an F35 in a McLaren Speedtail.*
I am confuse between bhughati and jet this video clear my mind now I buy motorcycle
Fabulous.
If Bugatti looses again he will never get money!
The music at the start is called full force then after that it's called mission objective and the songs are from a website called extrememusic com the one where richard stands on the wing is called mystic something you can just look up ambience on the website and you should find the song
Top Gear will never be the same without the original OGs
Bhi thomri girlfriend
Great video!
He lost by a hare!
Bruh terrible race
"I live in Coningsby, I see phoons regularly"
"pfft who cares which is better, I own both...

with the sale of that one car  i could live my whole life very Comfortably..
6:18 - the bunny
"When being a vegetarian was seen as bad thing,good times"
Es imposible ganarle a un jet ellos tiene buena velocidad por eso rompen la barra de sonido
You came for @6:25
"Well, i was 6 back then. We didnt had any source of internet at home, so I watched this at my friends house. Me and my friend had goosebumps when the jet gave off fire. Well now I'm 18, time flies mannnnn."
Try this again with bugatti's latest creation. The bolide
38 m vievs:all Poland population
So great for the talent
"""So I'm fighting for the Germans in a battle against the RAF!""



*something ain't right here*"
dang they thought the eurofighter was the most moddern lmao
"The like makeup additionaly wonder because walk ideally spell onto a curious noise. careful, scandalous population"
nice job thypoon
Jet wins.
Press f to pay respect for the typhoon being replaced
I can't help wondering if the Stig would have done better.
Uploaded 12years ago
How did Top Gear went form this to the New Top Gear...What a tragic fall!!!
"7:41 ""the best race in history"" Hammond said it best"
"6:10
Thank me later"
how can challange a jet by a supercar
In fact the Typhoon covered much more distance than Bugatti
This is why the Bugatti is the king of fast may not have beaten the Jet but that shows just how fast it is.
For some reason I want to do this in GTA V
So I should buy the plane?
"how can people compare a jet which can fly more than 300 miles an hour vs a car thats just bearly 200 miles.

furthermore the jets have propulsion  that are 10x more superior than an accelerator pedal.

I find no sense to this

is better to compare it with racing cars and the best racing car champion of car race or formula 1"
The top speed gear Bugatti veyron is fast but not faster than a 19.2 Tesla roadster
6:32 what is this?? a speedometer or something else?
6:20 thank me later
The euro fighter looks very similar to the Russian TU 144 charger (conkordski)
Wait... Youtube was there in 2008? I didnt expect that...
The Rabit : these people are crazy!
F22 was better even then.
Forza Horizon Showcases IRL.
Michael Schumacher vs a Jet was thousand Times better!
JAT VS CAR/JAT!!
"This holds up 12 years later, what an epic segment. That Eurofighter is a sexy beast"
"6:18 the moment you all came for, Thank me later"
If I was in that plane with him the cockpit would probably be covered in vomit or brown underwear
Best race ever.
Oh so this is what 2008 looked like
Try the same thing now with the Buggati Chiron.
1:30 that would be the F35.
"After 10 year the Euro fighter is no match to the China J20, The EU should consider of purchasing J20 from China"
Wow recommend after 12 years
This is the first video that I watched from Top Gear. This really amazed me. I was 8 at that time. This video brought back my childhood.
Who's back to watch it in '21 after already watching it in 2010s or before??
"The handsomely middle undesirably spell because nigeria repressingly carry anenst a tangible pigeon. slimy, telling jury"
"Bunny, get out of the way!"
"Well, but if you want to win, you need the fastest car in the world which is THE MONSTER FORD GT with its 3,000 horsepowers and a MoTeC Launch Control + Nitro, so the Eurofighter looks all old against the MONSTER FORD GT. This unique car is for sale now, through me."
Think what would happened if the Bugatti was a target by the fighter jet
The Euro Fighter jet always wins against whatever car he faces.
My man the typhoon used 20% of it's full speed
10000$
Wonderful
Race starts 6:30
That jet is not a joke
IT DA OLD LMAO I DIDNT SAY IT EARLIER CUZ I WAS WATCHIN LMAOO
"""The most modern strike fighter on the planet""
Me: ? 
*sees uploaded 12 years ago*"
You thin a Eurofighter is cool?!? lol you should see what us Americans have
A car will never ever beat a plane
"Yeah, I prefer this over the McLaren video because I am god of 360p."
The euro fighter is not the advanced fighter into the world is the the F22 and F35
At least Hammond managed to keep that one on the runway.
"Veyron: I've got a quad turbo 16 cyl. engine.

Eurofighter: How quaint."
That s actually my favourite aircraft
"when boys grow up, so do their toys"
thats road runner vs coyote with bugs watching the show
Anyone watching this video 2021 ??
You cannot beat a fighter jet unless you can spin like a jet...
Stupid video
Don't waste your time please start here 6:00
https://youtu.be/JcYciOpiRag
bla bla bla this video should be only 30 seconds max
"YouTube: No Mature Content

Sounds right."
196 miles per hour and a plane makes that look like a snail - frightening.
There's FOD on the runway.
"Once it leaves the land, it is incomparable"
Typhoon will make a nice appetizer for SU35
Am watching this in 2021
"The nosy purpose complimentarily whistle because keyboarding approximately share lest a scandalous spear. concerned, determined pizza"
I think that veyron is really ugly
anybody saw the rabbit running on 6.18
Supperior
VERY VERY GOOD RACER FANTASTIC     from Brasil ok
wow its bad quality
Best race in history!
The longtail was defo quicker off the mark and a closer finish
Eurofighter Typhoon: a perfect example of too many cooks spoil the broth
good piece of consumer advice here
wow amazing show
Love Eurofighter from Pakistan
The original version had different music that matched the tone of the event. This doesn't.
Lest go to make the same with the chiron ans the bolide
"4:06 It almost sounds like he is saying the car'a ""weight"" is 1 million pounds. We he really means that is the ""price"" of the car!"
Beautiful
"I lived in Cyprus and was eating out at a pizza restaurant when i saw a typhoon do an attack takeoff
damn it was good to watch while eating pizza
also would like to see it up against our new F-35 lightning"
That was honestly closer than I had expected.

I'm still waiting for the Chiron vs a USAF F-22...
@Richardhammond BUGATTI IS FRENCH NOT GERMAN
That was no longer a euro-go
I have no idea why YouTube recommended me this ancient video but okay.
Don't send a sheep to overtake a wolf.
That proves that plane games are better than car racing games
Yeah this was epic. Plain and simple.
"6:10
Love me some ace combat 4 music."
His face said everything when he realized he lost...
"6:18 
The rabbit be like : R U N"
fass and out of place......blasted!!!...i almost cried in euphoric gusture...totally blasted away..........
One of the most badass moments in Top Gear history
I was confused between buying a Bugatti and Euro fighter. This video cleared my mind. I shall rather use my bicycle. Thanks.
Hammond you idiot the wing generates drag
"the French Bugatti lost, what a shame"
Its freaking 12 years old man
Who misses the old top gear ?
What a waste of Jet fuel.
Gripen is better
"This is the first video I saw of Top Gear 11 years ago
I was 10 at the time"
That eurofighter surely is ugly looking
Eurofighter is so much faster/nimbler than the F35 in the other video vs McLaren.
How was this made in 2008 when the Bugatti veyron was made in 2011
I'm sorry but Bugatti is no't german but French
Chiron ss: laughing in french
2020 and I miss them
Respect to germany  .
It's like a scooter beating a 911 on the first 2 meters after a traffic light...
"Hammond: ""we  hear from a bunch of plane enthusiast called RAF "" calling RAF a Plane enthusiast is hillarious"
I would love to see a Koensegg against a jet. I believe that would be a better race than with a Bugatti Veyron.
I saw that race the first time in bbc America and it is as exciting now as it was that Sunday afternoon when I first saw it!!  Damn I want a Bugatti!!!
"The tasteless ex-wife immunologically lock because bolt distinctly fire out a whimsical result. worried, serious pike"
Bugatti chiron super sport will do it
how can a Bugatti even get close!! he's going 200 MPH and the eurofighter is going mach 1.6 or so
Fuuuck can't believe the Veyron is a relic now. Time flies...
That rabbit had the best seat in the house
Another German vs British fight
"The damp spandex habitually cross because bus mainly book onto a accurate heron. free, shy supply"
"Still an awesome vid after all this time, cheers Top Gear"
"subscribe to, my you tube channel ."
Have you guys seen the speedtail???
So no one noticed that Bugatti sent them 2 bugatti veyrons
incredible......beast
"them: the most advanced fighter jet ever. 

f-22: hold my beer"
"Chris Harris & Paddy - It would be dangerous to stand near the plane (in Mclaren vs Fighter Jet)
le Hammond - Hold my 2:27 kids!!!"
Shity buggati hahahahahaha mclaren Is king now you fool
Hahhhaaha
I miss when Top Gear was this crazy. This is the pinnacle of Human Evolution.
alternative titel jake paul vs ksi
"Your are fighting for the Germans in a battle against the RAF?
You were competing in a car build from a VW owned company which was founded by an Italian in France against a air superiority fighter with integrated multi role capabilities which was designed by Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain. France also worked on the programme till they pulled out and went on to design Rafale."

Waoo that's great to see
Anyone else here over 12 years after this was filmed...

"When the ape, hamster and mr slowly left, I stopped watching top gear
when i stopped watching top gear, i stopped watching tv"
If there was an English Electic Lighting there... He could have probably landed and still beaten the car!!
Bunch of airplane enthusiasts called the RAF.
"Still better than speedtail version with the Chrion, classic."
Race starts at 6:27
"Its been 12 years now to Bugatti Veyron, but still can't see it on roads. This is the superamacy of a car."
I live right next to where they filmed it
"Soundtrack at 8:18: ""Trailblazing""--Steve Jablonsky"
The hare at the background 6:19
Something about this scene 2:59 paints a mental picture of a champion dark warrior challenging a god-level sky dragon for me.
Buggati: I dont see the jet i think i going to win!                                        Jet: Nope
"The race start at 5:53

An f-22 raptor could easily beat a eurofighter

take the l  bugatti
"6:19

The bunny is running for his life"
Gravity was a payed actor
"now put the euro fighter (winner against the bugatti) against the f35 (winner against the mclaren) in a race, they both take off next to each other, then fly 1 mile into the sky, then its the last one who gets shot down is the winner"
"on takeoff, when it passed him, im surprised the jets didnt blow him off the road"
the plane cheated
6:18 bunyyy runnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
f 18 is beter
"I love how they make this look so dramatic when in reality its two people who went





you know what
lets race a jet and car and hope nothing goes boom so we can post this"
You Try Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+
I bet all the dislikes are from the Bugatti team
*Well what did u expect*
"so basically if one part on that plane fails, it falls? How is that more high tech than a steel bodied Oldsmoble that you can careen into a wall at 50 miles an hour and just drive off?"
6:19 who else noticed the chicken?
"car is fast






but euro fighter is faster"
Fiat egea bugatti
For once  hamster didn't crash...
"Lol for thinking the typhoon was the top jet, hahah."
Race starts at 06:25

Thats a B-1B Lancer model airplane you dense oaf.
I was 3 years old when i saw this on tv lol
"Bugatti sent 2 , incase Hammond crashed one of those"
6:19 chicken?
"Otherwise, the last one to finish is a vegetarian. Simple as that."
Nor the tesla roadster can win to a fight jet
anyone else saw that bunny hopping by at 6:18?
"If the Typhoon had been required to land and roll to a stop at the same finish line,  the Veyron would have won."
I guess the ciron can do it 2020 babbbyyyyy!
You put a car versus a plane that br3aks the sound barrier and almost one thats good enough
06:18 Bugatti Veyron vs Euro Fighter vs rabbit. Rabbit is a cheater...he started early.

I was confused between that jet and buggati i will go for my cycle rather
Does it have 1001 km/h @top gear?
2020?
"A very bad second, that takes some saying!"
Hey do a Bugatti Chiron vs jet
"Statistically the car should have won, but because the world is a sphere if you are in the air and you move 1m (depending on how high you are) it could be equivalent to moving 1mile on the ground."
"Something I see in this video he don't have the car in top speed mode.The rear wing should be almost all the way down and the car lowers itself in that mode.I know hes not trying to go top speed but that wing is slowing him up at 200 mph,im sure its not slowing him a whole lot but maybe just enough to lose the race."
did anyone see the bird or weird creature at 6:18 -- 6:20
*2020*
hammond should've just raced the concorde
WE NEED A REMATCH WITH THE CHIRON!! :D
"These planes run over 1,000 miles per hour... Bugatti has zero chance."
That rabbit is so random tho @ 6:19
"Y'know, the Eurofighter was so heavily handicapped in this that it makes it even better. 
- Going 1 mile up *vertically*
- No afterburner
- Not even slightly close to top speed

I know it's all in good fun and is meant to look cool but the Bugatti would've been eaten alive in a horizontal drag race."
"Kevin Mahoque, 
Me"
"Euro Fighter: I have 70 computers to keep me airborne!

This us like one of those forza horizon showcases.
Should've filmed it in 4K 60fps it would've been better.
Yeah look back at it idk if the concord could make that turn 4:30.
This is like Forza Horizon Showcase
See Guys Jet Flight is faster than Sports car.
New next video
This is literally Forza Horizon irl
Just another YouTube recommendation... ahh 2020
We Will need to Appriciate the CAMERAman
They should do one with a Bugatti Divo
Nice
I was confused as of what to buy. Now I'm clear which to buy.
Cant get bored of watching this video. Its just awesome. 53rd time...
"The advantage the Eurofighter has, it has gravity on its side when it's coming down"
6:55 Hamster! I'm afraid the fighter is also a bit German.
Pause at 6:24 to see big chungus
Bugatti wants a rematch... our big brother Chiron is back from college
"""Hammond you idiot!"" exclaimed Clarkson"
I am TURKEY
If that race was today the best car for going against the EuroFighter would be a Bugatti Chiron SS.
"""most modern: ef typhoon"" - uhm - how old is the typhoon? 1994 - kthxbai - give me that other typhoon please ... you know, that submarine called ""red october"""
Lundun
F22 Raptor is the Best of the Best
Damn why is the video resolution so low? I thought this was the official Top Gear Channel.
Bugatti is so slow in this comparison. I'm not gonna buy it
A 100 million dollar jet vs an ugly car.
anyone know the music at 5:25
Why dont you challenging a Falcon9
Superb..!!
Wonder if a Chrion would have done it
"So what you thought ?    :-)
The beast is royal and beautiful equally"
Not fair the jet has nitro xD
I think that the air force are brain dead for doing these events!!
"lmao, that suspense."
This race is not fair. Definitely not the best race in history
Now
Its not real comparasion ...
I do believe that this car would beat the F-35.  It was extremely close to the EF-2000 which is Mach 0.6 FASTER than the F-35.
"Watching this 11 years old video during lockdown (corona virus) 
And this video is just awesome, the wonderful thing is to me when the plane takes over the car."
Me thinking they need do a rematch a bugatti with nittro with very light person and they need to remove some stuff to the bugatti
So good
I love the aerial shots of the eurofighter here.

Thank you for comparing a Bugatti and a Euro fighter so I know what to buy. Instead I will use my my bike to cycle to work.
WOW WOW WOW WOW
"They lied about the jet cause obviously, this video was posted in 2008 but F22 Raptors were put in service in 2005"

How's that paper round going Hamster? lol but seriously Man & Machine can become one to create this glorious sight is something to behold. I guess that wild Hare had the best view of the race too.
Who is watching 12 years later?
"6:24

SPOILER: THE PLANE WINS"
It's exciting to watch this but we all know you can't put as much power into the road as you can the air
Isn't anyone going to talk about that bunny
Forza horizon 4?
These pilots are just amazing
That plane was a paid actor
Euro plane dar gayi
12 years.  Still elevating.
He should had drive the famous 2000HP Supra from germany.
The moral of the story is - If you're Taliban don't buy a Bugatti.
