Pewdiepies kid is gonna look at this 5 years later wondering what this is

Still love this song!
This shit stills slaps in 2023

Man.... I want to go back to this point of time.. This was so much fun.
"its been awhile. im a completely different person now, but i wish i could go back to these days. filled wit emotion listening to this song its been years. glad to say i took part in this great war."
When mrbeast passed T pewdiepie will make another song??
1:51
"After 4 years, this is still a banger. 

Man, I feel bad for everyone who missed the war"
1:02 most passive aggressive song ever
This era was amazing! Shout out to all the Filipino 9 year olds!

MrBeast clapping at the end like he just started his challenger arc

I lived to see the war and the tension was crazy
I was alive during this war

The one song on youtube T-Series won't pirate and put on their channel.
one of history ever
"Still here, replay this masterprice and remember the good old days"
YouTube will never reach these heights again
Loved that war sm
its so funny that pewdiepie made a music from t-series and this so banger
we all witnessed the greatest war of youtube back then
"How I long for the days when this war was going on. Truly, one of the biggest pieces of internet history.

ps: I ALWAYS brofist at the near end."
And now he's married. I feel like a proud dad rn
Did I miss something?
"You Know What? 
When MrBeast Hit 1 Billion Subscribers, I Will Remake This Song To Congratulate To MrBeast.
Thanks, PewDiePie."
Here after mr beast is now the 2nd most subbed YouTuber.
I will put this. Comment for no reason
4 years later and still a banger from a time where things were simple and before cancel culture became a thing
"Aug 5 2023 miss those Days 4 year's ago
And deym MR Beast here too one who passed hes Subscribes. Everything is in pattern. New era cones"
leaving this comment (four years late) to prove i was alive at the time this transpired

"This should be Sweden's national anthem. If not, Scandinavias."
The bitch lasagna
Good song
Those were the good days!
After 4 years... idk Mr.Beast was there xD
Am i late?
I was in 5th grade when this song came out. Im in 10th grade now (idk how the math works either idk)
Yes
I just realize... caption sign language?
"After 4 years, I'm still brust in tear after listen to the part ""so, this is it...."""
PewDiePie is still number one Since he didn't use a sub bot
"Do you remember when our troubles were non existent?
But then the 2010s happened
and then covid happened
and I'm depressed and lonely
A true gamer."
"Lol, so fun to watch
Happy life comes back"
Miss the old days
Rizzed him up
What a fantastic journey
This might be older than boyinabands gf
Leaving this comment so people will remind me of this masterpiece.
POV:what if T-Series watching this video?
sheeeeeesh
wholesome 100 chungus song
"2:49 melted my heart. Always will be here for you, Pewds. Congrats on being a father :D"
I miss these times of pewdiepie vs t-series
"Just remember, there's a chance Pewdiepie made a second version of this in the event he won"
Today
I remember this video dropping like it was yesterday
T-Series still ignores
Pewdiepie is amazing!
I was there.
1:23
STREAM SEVEN BY JUNGKOOK

"Lost the battle, won the war."
This is better than Bitch Lasagna ngl.
"What cars do eggs drive?







A Yolkswagen."
Why did the gym close down? It just didn't work out.
Singing in the shower is fun until you get soap in your mouth. Then it's a soap opera.
"bro 4 years, i feel like it was yesterday. god do i feel old, i miss old youtube"
.
Miss when pewdiepie and smosh ran youtube
god im so mad that dave had to be a shitty person
Good times
Was feeling nostalgic and just watched this again and again. The rein of Pewdiepie was for sure the best of youtube times. Thanks for blessing us 9 year olds with your weirdness and creativeness.
1:20 I just noticed that joke
"why is roomieoffical in this I don't know, but I'm not complaining"
Muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muitomuito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muitomuito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito muito 2:12 2:14
"From Bangladesh, those time was so fun man. It's a true nostalgia. We love you FELIX."
too bad boyinaband is a fucking pedo this song slaps
i just nostalgic old memories
I thought pediwepieand t-serires was in war
Old legend
Wow I can't believe that it has been 4 years since the war happened. How I miss pewds being number 1 and be with the community to defend the King PewDiePie.
Gonna watch it again
when you finally hit 1000 subs
This song randomly pop out in my recommend and it's FIRE
Nostalgia
this was not real
I always come back to this song and think they're congratulating my birthday because everyone forgot my bday
Who won?
"This song is great but coming in at 4 years later, why didn't you do one for Mr. Beast?"
Man this used to be the most intense war
"I missed this song so much, holy cow"
Nowadays Mr. Beast in the end feels some spicy
Mfw corporate is still winning to this day
I watched this when it first came out and now its 2023 and i just remember this video
I still watch this every year
forever an amazing song. congratulations  forever :)
Those were the days
he has no enemies..
Love a good re recommendation
Wow he just for real loving them and gave up
29/07/2023
7/28/2023
i think mr. beast clapping was a sign that he'll be number 1 soon enough
The war ended years ago but i am still watching this shit
Aww memories
Still a W
Yea it was a good time
"I remember putting up, ""Subscribe to Pewdiepie"" posters in my high school during this ""war"". Crazy how fast time flies. This was such a fun time to be a part of the bro army."
4:11 MrBeast clapping is hilarious
Pewdiepies first subscriber must feel like the king of the world
4:10 best cameo ever
Good bro GOOD

I was here before the war but I saw it
Youtube recommended this bop to me lol thanks youtube

Congrarulatioms to cooperation
I miss pewdiepie I used to watch him so much
incredible job
Leaving a comment to prove that I was alive to see this war!
It's ironic that MrBeast is at the end
Mr beast
Every time I'm reminded of T-Series I come back to this
This brings back so much nostalgia from the war
Why pewdiepie sounds like mr beast in this song?
"It's hard to believe, now Felix has a child. His child will sure have great nightime stories."
one day we will look back at this and drop a tear while feeling goosebumps
This song and bitch lasagna make me proud to be part of the 9-yr old army
I cried the first time I saw this
"PewDiePie might have lost the battle, but the war is not over yet, the power stands between MrBeast and T-Series now"
Who still listening to this?
2:00 best parts starts
i remember all the pewdiepie or tseries shorts lol
Tseries cheated tho frfr pewds is pure
This is the best song
Que nojo
"Here after felix is having a baby

PewDiePie Vs MrBeast (Tie)
Videos like these really make me miss the pre-Coronavirus era
I did not forget you pewdiepie
"When this came out I thought it was over becouse of ""the last brofist""."
MrBeast clapping at the end just EPIC
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
Why?
"I'm here again, just to say 4 years later that once again, this song is a banger. Thank you."
Did you see how he fixed his glasses at 0:28
"The 2010's was the golden age for songs, who agree with me?"
"Perfect example of something that has aged like a fine wine
Congratulations indeed Pewds, Congratulations"
Everyone coming back to this banger after 4 years
"230M+ and 300M view is best video view ever in pewdiepie's vids
Most many video of Pewdie's views are over 30M+ this 2nd youtuber channel is lovely too like MrBeast

Why didn't T-Series comment?
"I missed the war. But, I didn't miss the song. This is indeed a banger"
_I just wanna tell you that I think that you're amazing!_
T series: who are you?
"Man. . . I will always remember the war. It was a long war but we prevailed. This song reminds me of times before everything in the world went bad because of covid, when I could come home from a long day of work and watch pewds or markiplier. I miss those times, but I still love coming back to rewatch this and b**** lasagna. They will always have a place in my heart."
Congrats on baby bjorn!

"i wonder what happened to T-series you still there living life with your family he got nothing but other peoples problems,

Checking in from 2023
"Dave, Joel and Felix KILLED it with this song!
It's been 4 years and it's still a banger dude...
Despite kinda being a meme song it's compositionaly and lyrically (In the sense that they're well writen not that they carry deep meaning) it's really fucking good!"
After his latest video with him taking an extended break due to having a baby soon and him giving a brofist. It reminded me of the sentimental part in this video so I had to see it again.
Im too old it its 4 years but it feel like yesterday
THIS IS RACIST I LOVE INDIA AND INDIANNNNNNS #1 MOST POPULATED COUNTRY YASSSSS!!!!!!
"That ""last brofist"" still gets me"

"Well, now it is up to the student, Mr. Beast, to carry on the legacy of Pewdiepie and become the greatest."

No ones gonna talk about MrBeast being in the last part? Must be a symbolism
This was the first war I had ever saw
Damn it's been four years time flew so fast
The biggest battle of all time
I come back here today to raise a glass to the first and last king of YouTube. He was our monarch who ruled with fairness and respect. I wish him a long and joyous life as he begins he newest adventure as he enters fatherhood. All hail the One True King. Long Live PewDiePie.

"Regardless if you hate or love PewDiePie, there is no doubt that he was an absolute legend. He shaped so many people's childhoods and inspired so many to become context creators."
