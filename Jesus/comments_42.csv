The real offensive was the friends we made along the way
"America spent 200 billion $ alone. Provided them with all the NATO equipment, money and intelligence. Ukranians got 3 empty villages.
What a great investment."
Stop funding this unwinnable war!!!
"And all of this - (the ruination of the Ukraine) - could have been avoided if Ukraine had been allowed 
to fulfil the Minsk Accords, to which they were signatory.  Instead they chose to murder their citizens
in the Donbas & Luhansk and use the time to arm and become de facto members of NATO.  
When it come to the question of WHO is responsible for the rumination of the Ukraine - I would suggest 
YOU patriots look in the mirror."
Mean while in reality https://youtu.be/qnU41uNrbnw
Ukraine needs peace. Sit down and negotiate with Russia to end the war.
Stop wasting our tax dollars on weapons and broker a peace deal immediately!!
One word - FAILURE.
"POSSIBLE SUPPLEMENTAL DELIVERY SYSTEM:  Probably a crazy idea:  Set-up large Ribbs or large jon boat to be remote controlled and stealthy as possible.  Then arm it with a single guided missile that can be launched via remote control.  The idea is to get the boat as close as possible to the target, such that, given the speed of the missile, Russian air defenses would have limited time to react."
What would of been a better use of resources would of been genuine peace talks. BBC can you calculate the carbon footprint of this war and the other NATO wars? Its just with all the fires raging around europe etc i thought this might of been a concern.
Hey man. You know how many different missles russia has? Russia is pushing forward. Newsflash  russia is not losing this war crazy people. Russia hasnt even pushed their airforce full force yet. Yall lying propagandist
"They should start by saying ""Russian Liberated Areas!"""
Its failing badly
"Now the United States and Europe have squandered all their strategic military reserves to help Ukraine, the whole world is just waiting for this. The US and Europe are weakening because of Ukraine. And then, when the United States and Europe weaken because of Ukraine in military resources and potential, then China will be able to easily capture Taiwan, North Korea will easily capture South Korea. And no one can prevent them from doing this. A weak lion will cease to be the master of the jungle ."
"People wake up, it is not possible for Ukraine to win against Russia - Russia does not even work with the entire army while Ukraine deployed earthing. They may regain some unimportant villages but this line is impossible to be broken - it is pure fantasy. NOtonly that mines, trenches, and obstacles are there put behind is a firepower of artillery, helicopters, jets, tanks, RPGs, infantry and all others...This led only to more and more casualties with no effect at all. Pointless..."
"War latest, Ukraine is smashed and lost and Russia having a riot testing its new weapons on masses of stupid troops who use ww1 tactics and haven't got a clue how to fight a war, negotiate Ukraine and do yourself a favor"
Absolutely not ye TIDY SLAPPERS STOP WAR MONGERING.CHEERS FROM A COLONIAL OER THE POND
Bbc is lying to the public.... All there  statement about ukraine willing is but a myth
Russia is not iraq...
President Putin wont let Drug Addict Drag Queen zelenskyy in high heel shoes installed and backed by LGBTQIA+ US White House on cocaine dominate Mother Russia. Cocaine Clown zelenskyy in laced high heels had a dream... the possible dream... and it turned out to be a wet one....
Ukraine needs F-16/F-15 to regain all the territories. Otherwise it will remain a stalemate.
Can it? It already is. WTF do you people expect? Russian capitulation? IT'S A WAR! Taken holistically the Ukrainians are doing fine.
These people are delusional.
Ukrain will win  when NATO engages the russians ...oh i forgot NATO desnt give a shit...as long as ukranians r dying for nothing   WASHINGTON IS happy.....!!!!!
Western media are liars & bias
"1. We don't want to go to gay parades and castrate our own children by turning them into trannies. 2. We do not recognize the world domination of the United States. 3. We do not want a fascist Ukraine to exist near our border.


Russia will win!!!"
"All those promises, all that spin by the media, all those billions, those sanctions that have destroyed our economy and all those Ukrainian lives.... And Russia is stronger now than anytime in there history and getting stronger by the day.  And the BBC asks the question 'can it still succeed'   Yes BBC, like all the hoping youve done for the last 18months, of course Ukraine can win. Russia is in tatters after all...."
"Because the UN is a dirty Yankee registry office that will only serve humanity when it changes direction!

The UN and Japan do not name the culprit of Hiroshima and Nagasaki for ""fear of reprisals""
The ""forgetfulness"" of Japan and the UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, about who is responsible for the Hiroshima catastrophe is related to Washington's fear, independent candidate for the New York Senate, Diana Sayre, told Sputnik. This is how he commented on the lack of mention of the USA in his speeches dedicated to the tragedy.
On August 6 and 9, Japan remembers the victims of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. Japanese politicians who spoke at the ceremony did not mention that the bomb was dropped by Washington. The UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, also did not mention in his message the country responsible for the indiscriminate attack on Japanese cities. His speech contained no reference to the US as the country that carried out these nuclear bombings."
"Ukraine must attack and destroy the Russian mainland hundreds of times more than it is now, Ukraine will win. From Korea."

Does anybody think Ukraine can send the russians back to Russia?!
"But its not going to plan Ukraine, so why do you sell all this bs propaganda to the lying UK media?.  I do not believe a single word of it.

THE WEST:  We will never give you heavy weapons.
THE TRUTH: Here you go Ukraine, have heavy weapons, even though we promised not to do this.

UKRAINE:  But we want peace, we want peace.
THE TRUTH:  But even though they have been offered numerous times to discuss the situation with Russia, directly from Russia, it goes on deaf ears.  The Ukrainians want the war.

ZELENSKY:  I am so hard done by, my people are so hard done by, we Ukrainians are so hard done by, whaaaa.  Give us more, just keep giving us more, or we will throw our rattle out of the pram and accuse the West of not helping, because I AM UNGRATEFUL and ARROGANT.  Who am I? and what am I?.  
THE TRUTH:  Zelensky and his country, the Ukraine are leeching off the West, are troublesome and have every intention to use Western heavy weapons to strike deep into Russian territory.

I see this conflict for what it really is.  The Ukraine and the West want the war, they will continue on with the war until wham.  Britain will cop it and there will be no reprisals from NATO.  Britain is the Russians target and yes I can see London being wiped off the face of the planet and no reprisals from the West / NATO will take place in the form of a nuclear war.  The British seem to think striking back when this event happens is the most logical thing to do.  NOT HAPPENING BRITAIN, we all know you want it, but ITS NOT, I repeat, NOT happening.

As for the media, you may be able to manipulate people in the UK, USA, etc, etc, but a lot of us cannot be manipulated, because we did not sell our souls, like so many have.  If you are not lying about Covid, you are lying about an engineered war or lying about something or rather.  You too will be removed soon, along with your dangerous AI."
Ukraines offensive is winning! We ate talking about the offensive against the western taxpayer right?
"Now you're talking about air force and after Russia destroys it, you will find another excuse.  Why dint you invest on peace talks"
"UKRAINIANS ARE LIKE THOSE EVIL CHARACTERS IN VIDEO GAMES... SAFETY BY NUMBERS BUT THEY CAN'T REALLY WIN THE WAR OR GIVE YOU MUCH DAMAGE... THEY JUST KEEP COMING IN HUGE NUMBERS AND WITH THE RIGHT AMMO, YOU WILL ENJOY KILLING THEM"
"NATO may have to let Ukraine join, so it can be effectively defended before everyone goes broke funding loosing strategies(?). 
  After all, the world's food supply, and all sovereign Countries Putin's lusting for, are at stake."
Give ukraine airpower .....
"Ukraine can never reclaim 20% of its territory by siding with EU anymore. Ironically this war wouldnt happen if they still pro russian. History happens, time get over it"
"TAKES A LONG,,,,TO FIGHT THE ....

RUSSIAN SHOWELS,,,,,,,

BYE GREETINGS FROM ASIA..."
"COMMENTATOR...

WHY ,,,YOU BRITISH DO NOT GO

AND

THE BRITISH TERMINATOR,,,JOHNSON,,,
HE WILL FIX IT ALL,,,,

GREETINGS FROM ASIA...."
"Lets not be Delusional, Ukraine is winning against Russia by western support:
Proofs:
15 million refugee in Europe.
Ukrainian Army Brigade collapsed 
Hospitals overflow. 
400 thousand soldiers killed."
"Hasil peperangan ini sudah terlihat, dan yg akan menjadi pemenang ialah rusia, dan itu menyakitkan untuk rezim kyiv dan segelintir orang"
"Why American and west media are supporting a war in Ukraine number one for no reason ukrania is losing territory because they are fighting Russia 
Ukraine have no chances and America and Europeans leaders know but you guys want this war for you own selfishness you want to mess with Russia why? Because Russia is in your away of globalism and domination!"
Get rid of zelensky and the war stops
"The question should be ""succeed at all""  not ""still succeed"" as it is clear Ukraine is finished even with all of the support heaped on it by the west and the silly childish sanctions against Russia that have backfired spectacularly. The west needs to wake up, this is Russia, not Afghanistan or Vietnam or Korea or Iraq.... and the west couldn't win those wars either no not a chance this will end well for ukraine!
Thank Victoria nuland-erthal and co for taking Ukraine down this road to oblivion with the coup in 2014 in the failed effort to get Ukraine into nato, well done vicki!"
Nothing will happen.zalesky will be washed out.
"Other people have been saying it for a long time. Allow foreign pilots to fly the F-16s! If the US doesn't want to send their F-16, allow other nations to do so. Gain air superiority and drop boots on the ground behind enemy lines, bypassing the walls of mines. Russians are also using plastic casing mines, so it's harder to detect. One Ukrainian officer said that they need drones with IR cameras as these plastics heats up during the day and will be easier to spot"
"No defence is unbreakable this is just a hoax to stop the Ukrainian counter offensive. If the West give Ukraine what they need they will get the job done, but we are seeing sympathisers for Russia blocking Ukraine at a critical moment. Putin has got all his clothes packed for North Korea, we must keep the pressure on him."
No mention of casualties
Ukraine can't get it done without air power and long range missiles .has the counter offensive failed not yet but no air power no gains
Nope but of course the criminals in washington on both sides will pretend like Ukraine can win so that they can continue their never ending money laundering theft of US AID to their own hidden offshore accounts. THEY WILL DO ANYTHING TO STEAL OUT MONEY. Just like call Rumsfield expose $2.3 trillion missing from the Pentagon in the next day literally 9/11 happen in a plane hit the exact part of the building where the audit was going to be taking place. (100% true)
"Stupid BBC keep calling it a ""counter-offensive"", which it wouldn't be, even if they were getting anywhere. Operation Lame Tortoise is such a disaster that even the corporate media cannot hide it. The Australian general was still prepared to talk rubbish though. Ukraine controls less territory now than it did at the beginning of July. It does however have plenty of storage space, now that Russia has wiped out hundreds of its AFVs."
500 CV90 and 50x Gripen jets we could send today from just sweden
send everything ffs  or  world will lose
"When BBC is making reports such as this, you bet the situation is 3x worse. SLAVA ROSSIYA!!! GLORY TO RUSSIA!"
"BBC: ""Russians armed with shovels""..."
Stop dreaming about beating Russia.
After 2 months of counter offensive The Ukraine forces rerake friction areas
"The Aussie guy at 3.38  wouldn't know his ass from his elbow, he's just repeating the same rhetoric as that coming from the Pentagon... these ""journalists"" and ""experts"" need to go to the place and actually see what is going on, in Vietnam the US claimed it would win right up to the time of the helicopters taking people off the roof of the embassy as the North Vietnamese were coming through the front gate....."
"All western propaganda and MSM just like MI6 and CIA are overrated, just as the Leos etc have been proven to be. The Ukes only stopped charging forward into minefields as the mines were going off, no info from MI6, CIA or anywhere else for that matter advised them as they can't have known or they'd have been advised. 
The fact is, to wage war for an extended period of time a country must have the resources to do so which is why the US has historically been so strong in WW1 and WW2, JApan invaded other countries to obtain resources it needed prior to and during WW2 as the Germans did too. 
Russian as shown in WW2 has the resources to match the US in manufacturing weapons of war and far from the rhetoric of the west claiming Russian tech is somehow inferior, it is a match and in some case superior to the Western equivalents and Russia can and IS producing weapons faster than the silly US/UK puppet organization Nato can. Even under Stalin, Russia whilst in retreat in WW2 produced 10s of thousands of tanks which German production could not hope to match and the same situation exists now. 
All this talk of Russia running out of weapons, poorly trained and supplied claptrap is just that.
MSM are only now talking of Ukes not winning as the facts are staring those in Western governments in the face that the lies of the CIA/MI6 and co, just like with Iraq and WMD, have been proven to be just that, lies designed to convince the populations to support the BS wars the west wages against others all in the name of greed. 
The Russian SMO was forewarned by Putin for years once Nato started expanding eastwards in breech of the agreement at the time of the breakup of the USSR, the US responded in a similar way when Russian missiles were placed in Cuba which isn't even on the US border as Ukraine in to Russia, and the Cuba issue arose over US missiles being placed in Turkiye and Italy facing the USSR.... funny how we in the west only tell the story to suit our narrative and convince the populace through mis information, propaganda and lies, and all for what exactly..... so some corporations can make even more $$ from exploiting some other country for it's resources? Just another, more modern  form of  colonialism... most of the UK/EU/Japan/Sth Korea etc are now all puppet states of the US."
"Are we talking about the ""Spring counteroffensive""(the one that was supposed to start in March)? or is it some other counteroffensive?"
Lying press.
Waste of money. FU Ukraine.
"It pisses me off that the media is reporting western support faltering. It takes what it takes we have to stay with them!
ITS A WAR NOT A GODDAMN BAKE-SALE !!

THE MEDIA I CAUSING PROBLEMS AGAIN!"
These people are either delusional or paid to  lie to you.  I think the latter is more true.
"As it view American still work out in Ukraine 
How to pull the tug war ?
When Trump was in whitehouse he mbeen zoom withdrawn Nato but it vision can not pitch an interest earlier Obama and now Biden 
If US house and been divided  some politic surface then given a  vote for this panel , Trump could be taking America military back from Europe to country . Russia will do same and end Ukraine war . Tgey will be nuetral country most pricely bwt  border to EU Russia  absolutely"
More soldiers dieing under Putin's Regime. The death toll rises again and again. Putins has unlimited wealth and unlimited supply of weapons.
Jouer
No.
"The BBC has lied about every US NATO and UK attacks on various nations for years. I bet I'm not the only one who simply don't listen to BBC, CNN etc."
Ukraine lost. why feed more weapons so that more idiots die for Zelensky and Putin ?
Defeating Russia is like hopping your boss would ask you to replace his position and salary.
With over 46000 Ukrainians dead or wounded  from the beginning of this counteroffensive stop this  insanity . All this for Western Imperialism
it never had a chance
Victoria police is trying to kill
If uk are gays then i ll be never gay
"The title should read ""Ukraine offensive - how can it fail"""
"Russia has always be shit at offense,  but good at defence"
Putin is war criminal.
"We have to understand that NATO is fighting a former superpower . 
Russia may be weakened but they still have enough fight left in them to give nato a bloody nose ."
BBC treating people like they are moron.. why dont you say its failed its need more time more supply and thats mean more of your money.. just get ready for the worst for economy
Next is london
The west can send as many tanks as they want but if you can't support them then they are pointless and work for a morale boost for the enemy.
Monty took a lot of flak for first months after d day till germans cracked. He predicted breakthrough would take 3 months which it did
"Jewish nazi zelensky is needed again to win the war. After graet success of nazi offensive ukraine needs jew zelensky more then ever. Jew zelensky should re-start playing piano with his dick , which he used to do with some measure of success when he was a travelling clown. If performed near front he could daze and confuse russian troops and in this way win great military victory for izreal and usa. He could become jewish hero who defeated formidable russian army by playing piano with his dick. And though this does not guarantee military success and victory nonetheless is worth trying."
Ofcourse.
"Western media keeps coping. It was all fun and games last year when the media kept taking the piss out of Russia's slow advances, now Ukraine is hardly advancing at all. Mmm-mmm, that's what I call a taste of your own medicine. Swallow it all down, suckers."
Good
What is point of counter offensive if the west does not provide them with air power for preemptive strikes?
Just my opinion the Ukraine counter offensive is too soon and they should keep it silent and surprised operation  imagine you told the owner of house you going to raid them and you expect they don't prepare anything?
No timeline = no confidence to accomplish it.
"minute 0:29...""formidable Russian defenses""......wow...a very british expresion I think..."
No Putin no war lets hope they get rid of Putin.
Where and when was the offencive?
"Can it still suceed? Lol it has already failed. Why does the U.S continue to suport what are clear Nazis.. this group is all present in the U.S.. when trump wins the election, they along with other white supremacist groups will be given the green light to being waging gorilla tactics in America.."
When will the BBC call a spade a spade and recognise the Russians have won
"I've been supporting Ukraine from the start, but now I just think it's Russians fighting Russians, Ukraines manpower is so little considering they're being invaded, nobody cares and men are fleeing the war. Ukraine don't even have any friends that are willing to fight with them, they're fighting alone. just let the Russians fight, who cares who controls what land over there."
Leopards are disappearing in Ukraine
"Yesterday I saw a very brave freelance journalist deliver a video report from the Russian side of the front line. In that report some soldiers in the trenches - including men local to the Donbas area - gave their answers to questions. The most striking feature of those interviews was their responses to questions along the lines of ""What would your message be to Zelensky?"". (Interestingly, they tended to pivot the question into 'what would I say to Ukrainian leadership?') In any case, without exception, their responses were peace-oriented, along the lines of ""We are all Slavs and should not be killing each other"". (Quite insightful when contrasted with the implacable hate-rhetoric coming out of Kiev and the fact that Ukrainian sports-persons cannot find it in their hearts to even touch the hand of a Russian opponent.) 
What struck me is the fact that I have never seen a frontline Russian soldier interviewed of the BBC or mainstream western media. Even though we supply weapons as a NATO member, the UK is NOT at war with Russia. Russians are people too: we should be allowed to hear what they have to say about the conflict and so make up our own minds about whether to disregard it. This is like coming across two random guys fighting in the street and listening sympathetically to whatever one says and coaching him, and putting the fore-fingers in the ears and going ""La, la, la, la, la"" when the second one speaks.
Why also does the BBC use February 24, 2022 as the beginning of time in relation to the conflict? Do British people not have the right to know that the roots of the conflict are in the 2008 NATO summit in Bucharest where America decided that it would be advantageous to invite Ukraine to join NATO? Given that if this conflict continues to escalate - or Ukraine actually manages to hurt Russia - the likelihood is that Europe dies in a thermo-nuclear holocaust, don't the British public deserve to factor the incontrovertible evidence of Americas sponsorship of the 2014 coup and continuous spending on the Ukrainian army since then into their assessment of the conflict? Victoria Nuland of the state department and Geoffrey Pyatt, the ambassador to Ukraine co-ordinated the 2014 'Maidan' with the oversight of (then) Vice-president Joe Biden to install a puppet regime. Between then and 2022 America spent 4 BILLION churning out a new battalion for the Ukrainian army every 55 days from a base in western Ukraine. Why does the BBC insist on being the government's PR department by misdirecting the public in the arrant nonsense that Vladimir Putin is on a war of conquest when the fact and existence of the Minsk accords - signed by Ukraine - document that all he has been seeking since 2008 is that Ukraine has the same status as Austria or Switzerland - neutral - so that America can't use it to locate nuclear missiles on Russia's border. That Minsk treaty was negotiated by Angela Merkel - the leading 21st century politician in Europe. How is it not relevant to public debate among thinking people in the UK that this woman - who commands universal respect as generally the only grown-up in the room was so appalled by the 2008 invite to Ukraine to join NATO that she (seconded by France) defied America by vetoing it. Her reason: such a development would for Russian security amount to a declaration of War. If Europe's de-facto leader was able to recognise that as a legitimate concern straight out the gate, all the way back in 2008, how can the BBC, in good journalistic conscience vilify Russia over its having responded in a wholly and previously predicted fashion to American machinations in Ukraine? The treatment of Ukraine as a de-facto NATO member has forced Russia to take military action to force further negotiations on what it could never see as anything other than an existential threat to its continued existence. This is in principle no different from America being recognised as having been within its rights as a state to view the location of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba back in 1962 as tantamount to an act of war by the Soviet Union.
The BBC has shamed itself by being, at best, mealy-mouthed and selective in what it reports on this conflict, and at worse, just as active in the disinformation war against Russia as the military-industrial-CONGRESSIONAL complex (that was Eisenhower's original phrase) that is happy to buys Russian deaths with Ukrainian lives and has a profit-interest in perpetuating the conflict for as long as possible."
How many times have they asked the exact same question
Ukraine is not a sovereign country since 2014. And is enslaving America and Nato. Every war has America's dirty hands.
This is like watching to prehistoric dinosaurs fight!
"3:18 general of australian army? Another Tiktok warrior, won 0 battles?"
"2:30 ""Ukraine retake all, retake Crimea, liberate Moscow, grab russian nuclear weapons, proclaim Siberian Republic, Belgorod republic, so? Where? What? When?"
Just because it took 8 weeks for D day to the end it doesn't mean Ukraine can do it in 8 weeks when they haven't even got  Fighter jets or air Support So it's a bit harder to do a counter offensive when you're fighting on the land and I think they've done a bloody good job to say they Ve done it just by land and drones And attacking at night is the best thing they can keep doing
"The Ukrainians have the Russians pinned down, cowering behind mine fields and obstacles, unable to advance, being chipped away day and night. This, while Russian ships are being attacked, bridges blown, depots exploded, and drones flying for hundreds of kilometers over Russian territory and into Moscow. Glory to Ukraine!"
Its zelensky fault...that dude just loves be on TV.....dude biggest clout chaser of all time....why the fuck 3 months before counter offense he on TV talking about that they counter offense russians in couple months....and when acting suprised that Russians prepared for that...LMAO
Stacking mines is nothing new or innovative. It just happens when you are sloshed and seeing double double all the time...S L A V A UKRAINI
This has to be most failed counter offensive in world history....wtf  they hyped this counter offense..shit was embarrassing
"this is what happens when you overthink everything  giving russians time to dug in and put land minds in the area. If you really want ukraine to WIN it should have been done a long time ago and should have been given  what they need. imagine giving bradley , leopards etc took several months. also you expect ukraine to be superman by blasting the russians with just thanks without  any air power. duh!"
"They've taken back territory, a net gain. They've blown holes in Russian ships. They've sent drones into Moscow multiple times. They're killing Russians everyday."
"Russian shovels are holding out well, it turns out"
"Raising the question of Ukrainian air superiority is very important. However considering the latest British Intelligence assesment that 150+ billion USD investment in Ukraine's ground forces were rendered useless by ""weeds and undergrowth"" we should certainly take in acount all those stray pigeons beforehand."
"Short answer no, long answer NOOOO"
Russia will be luquidated
Slava Ukraini
"Why? Just to name a few: 1. Integrity is everything. Ukraine Defence Minister doesn't have integrity. Major General Kyrylo Budanov must replace SERGEANT Oleksii Resnikov without delay. Stakes are high. Success depends on loyalty. 2. Putin's subhuman oligarchs have so many moles within Ukraine Defence Ministry and Zelinskyy's inner circle. 3. Putin's subhuman oligarchs have so many moles among top Pentagon Officials-and are the ones stopping Biden from providing Ukraine with long-range missiles and fighter jets and are providing Ukraine military with lousy military advice. EU and UK-not Pentagon-must run Ukraine military behind the scenes and must provide Ukraine more long-range missiles, fighter jets and other heavy weapons for Ukraine to win the Ukraine war without delay. They and Ukraine military must not give Putin's military a chance to get up or re-arm itself- and NO CEASEFIRE."
Noup.
"Mick Ryan so you call this offensive as going reasonably ok, shit id hate to see it go bad"
The very fact Ukraine was even allowed a counter offensive shows the Russian offensive failed.
Russia stand as a symbol of strength. One nation that can face the entire west (NATO). We the Africans nations need that strength from Russia to expell our colonial masters.
Ukraine is a testing groud for NATO
Ukraine needs long-range missiles and loads of them to hit Russian logistics and fuel & ammo dumps in Crimea. Also to finish off the Kerch bridge.
"Nato counter offensive has been a disaster. Thousand of ukrainians dead. Large amounts of nato equipment destroyed.  The usa & nato wont be happy until all possible ukrainians that can be killed, are killed"
"No, it can't."
Ukraine have still liberated far much more land than Russia did on their whole winter offensive.
Russia taking out the filth!
Garbage
"Tens of billions of EU/ US equipment have been completely destroyed..!!
 In their initial use on the battlefield. 
A complete waste of life and material that should have been foreseen. 
This point in the war and Ukrainians defense of Bakmute will be seen as where they all but lost the ability to gain ground in any meaningful way."
"Dear BBC...I suspect I am one of many who are  SICKENED by British media suggesting that Ukraine's counter offensive is disappointingly slow. What EVER  else did you expect, after the ""West"" shilly shallied, hopped about on one leg, behaved like chocolate soldiers for fear of the lying devil Putin. NATO    FAILED to supply proper weapons immediately to Ukraine. And failed to supply a no fly zone.  ABSOLUTE SHAME on NATO for sucking up to Putin in the beginning (France, Germany, Hungary, Italy for example), crossing fingers their buddy would pull back and be a nice reasonable man again. who will supply us with lots of oil. NO CHANCE. He is evil, lying, mad ignorant of accurate history and self obsessed. If ordinary people (not leaders) can see the folly of  NATO'S WEAKNESS why can't you and the leaders who receive a a good whack for allegedly keeping Europe and the free world safe from villains like Putin. .  Ukrainians are dying forALLl of us in the  free world. Ukrainians are having their ho,es, agriculture, industry water, electricity, schools, universities, hospitals wrecked for ALL OF US. They are keeping US safe in comfort.  Please remember that when reporting. They should be given everything they need to defeat Putin/Russia totally, flat. Read the recent Chatham House report.  Jane Soole, 79, Dorset, England."
no.
Sorry. Mam. Thanks so much

"The BBC thinking winning a war is about winning land, Ukraine's taking a battering"
A TOTAL FAILURE!!! Can you speak the truth?
Ukraine cant win go hear what COL DOUGLES MAC SAY...I STAND WITH RUSSIA ..IM SICK OF LIES FROM WOKE LIBERAL STATES AND MEDIA
"Russia is a categorically dangerous idea against life on planet Earth and Russia with its endless boundless wars and massive international crimes is redundant on planet Earth.
Demilitarization, collapse and cancel to russia the main enemys of existing humanity or humanrights and peaceful lives."
As a true Russian bot and Putin worshipper this comment section is like honey to me
European servant press is guilty of the great losses Ucrania in terms of people is having.
BBC News needs an updated news! Always behind on time.
Nope no air power it's been a waist of life
Can it still succeed ? Things must be pretty bad for the Ukrops side if the Beeb is leading with this question. I think we all know that Ukropia is done and just about dusted. Should have sat down and negotiated 6 months ago !
Russia has always been better at defense than attacking. The people in the west have watched too much of their own propaganda so they think Ukraine will win.
All they need is dominant air power to hit Russian artillery on the back. So that ground forces can clear mine fields .
"Both NATO and the US have miscalculated significantly as it relates to this offensive. U see they knew the Russians were building defensive lines and laying mines but what the west calculated was that THE TIME THEY WOULD TAKE TO PREPARE TRAIN AND EQUIP A UKRAINIAN DIVISION WAS LESS THAN THE TIME THE RUSSIANS WOULD TAKE TO PREPARE DEFENCES TO STOP THAT DIVISION. The problem however is that the Russian defensives are formidable and after two months Ukraine has only made insignificant gains! Yes they have captured territories like some villages but what people are not talking about conviently is at what cost were these territories liberated? 

Now since it is clear that the rate the Russians are building their defensive line is significantly less that the time that NATO and the US will take to train the Ukrainians or the time Ukraine is taking to break through these defensive lines i honestly dont see how Ukraine counter offensive is going to succeed"
"Are the amount of casualties the Ukrainians taking insignificant factor? No one mentions the fact that the Ukrainians have lost 40,000 soldiers in 2 months and hundreds of armored vehicles?"
If that happened they encyclical the Ukraine
"War doesnt work on time tables,it took 20 yrs in Afghanistan and they werent russia 
F16s wont make any difference, unfortunately that not the public narrative for news but its the obvious truth"
"into MONTH THREE of the Ukrainian offensive, so let's take a look at the list of villages, towns and cities regained by Ukraine......oh, nothing. not one single Ukrainian fighter has even reached the first line of Russian defences! that can be classified as a disastrous failure. thanks, NATO."
billions of dollars wasted. NATO stupidly thinks an army can be formed on the fly. it can't.
Ukraine can win if they just stop embezzling the war funds.
"Where is the f16 air support..oh that's right, YOU PRICKS ARE STILL PROCRASTINATING! Meanwhile more UKRAINIAN LIVES ARE LOST! SHAME ON YOU PRICKS!"
"Yes if the west gets its act together. Our delay and drip feeding of the necessary tools and all against the advice of our own military, allowed time to build extensive defences. We could still turn it around if we pitch in."
"Glory to Russia, still straight, heterosexual, traditional, white and very nationalist. Rejects the debauched perverted ideals of the West, EU and NATO. HURRAY!!"
It will be a very long war....in the end we all know ukraine will lose
"The western media would throw Ukraine under a bus imho. Zelensky is 100% correct to maintain as much ""radio silence"" as possible. 

54 : 1 fav - UKR to win"
its a joke russian forces waged war on ukraine and the ukraine army are now pushing russia into deffence they are doing this without air power give them the jets and it will be over very quick its the west fault ukraine are moving slower
"I still think it is just a matter of time before the 'breakthrough...' happens. 

But we need to lobby our political representatives, for such as America to supply ATACMS, and Germany to supply their long range weapons, and others?"
Nazi Ukraine will never succeed.  These terrorist must be stopped at all costs
Why can't Ukraine do a bombing run concentrating on 5mile strip of land to blow up or disable 90% of hidden mines laid by the Russians? I hope this bombing run over a week could clear path for infantry and heavy military trucks to pass through the mine field.
"You describe the Russian defence lines in detail, but what do the Ukrainian defensive lines look like? Are they similar? Which mines do they use? What do their trenches look like?"
"dear bbc, i stopped counting different accounts talking about ppp under this video. i hope you haven't for analytical purposes."
"Some idiot recons that Russia carry out 150 air strikes a day.   Standing of  10 km at 40,000 feet and dropping a bomb in an area of around 1km (that is about as accurate you can be - at that distance)  then that is not really air strikes as in the gulf war.   Their lazer guided JDAMS require the aircraft to not be carrying out anti air maneuvers."
As an experienced armchair general. Here is the maths. Percentages committed;  Ukraine 100% Russia 50/50 EU 50% US 70% Fight or flee Ukraine fight 100% Russia dont care have millions of foot soldiers EU 50/50 US no boots on ground. No air power no success. Answer stale mate
"No point in putting the effort into an offensive without Air Support...

Together with long range artillery continued barrage for weeks, then put the those pilots and additional jets are in the air, then move the infantry forward under both of those umbrellas, it must be conducted together."
"No, it cannot. No hope, we saw on the field"
This war has become a stalemate
"Maby the BBC needs to find different ""experts"" ?"
"have to feel sorry for the ukrainian people, duped into fighting america's proxy war against russia

all you need to know is that the bidens have made $millions from ukrainian oligarch's in the aftermath of the US sponsored 2014 revolution !"
1:28 'Some of the close up stuff is frankly to graphic to show.' *Proceeds to zoom in*
"Only the country with idiotic leadership can hope to win in a fight with another country whose mobilization resource is ten times higher, let alone the working military industrial sector."
Ukraine can win....At the moment this is more or less a frozen front line BUT when winter comes and if Ukraine can keep the pressure up on Russian supply lines the the Russian army will freeze to death in their trenches while the Ukrainians have hot food and drinks and regular changes of guard.....
"thinking that ukraine will win this war ,,,its only a dream,,,a fantasy"
It's succeeding now.
"The counter-offensive was not expected to be quick either, so what's the news here? It was known that russian territory was heavily mined, so the slowness of the offensive operation has never been a big surprise. Regarding the impact of the slowness, Russia is in far more dire straits with respect to time than Ukraine is. Russia will not cope economically with this war much longer, while Ukraine has most of the rest of the world's support. All help Russia can expect is from shithole-countries or crook-states such as North korea."
Give them what they need
Off course they will succeed stupid comment
"Ukraine is about to conquer the planet Ur_,anus."
Just admit ukraine counteroffensive has failed
"It would have been successful if it was conducted inside Joe Biden, Blinken, Zelenski and our free fair western media owner's mom's pssuy and hAsshole"
"The BBC have been lying and deceiving. Why do you keep blowing bubbles?
    Most Brits don't like you ,you represent the vested international interests of money. Brit people want to see the BBC dead and buried. Ignoring genocide in the Ukraine for eight years then coming on like a wise virgins. As a Brit we know you are on the ropes and your cheesy propaganda is only believed by the old ,sick and stupid.
    The Ukrainian army has repeatedly failed on ,land ,sea and air .
   BBC are establishment liars.....a complete joke , especially for Brits.
    Report the DEATHS ."
Bbc your father's  rassia
Perhaps it might be worth pondering why Russia has not been capable of mounting a full scale land offensive in over a year and is now focused entirely on a defensive mode.
yes it Can still succeed send more money they will win
"There is no question of the Ukrainian counter offensive still succeeding.  That is the BBC's way of saying 'Is Ukraine and the west being defeated ?'  

The  US conceded defeat when it agreed in Vilnius to Russia's core demand, when it vetoed Ukraine joining NATO.

That means the US is reconciled to the fact that Ukraine cannot win.   Hence, the US knows Ukraine is a loss centre, so it is preparing to cut its losses.   Zelensky was told to be grateful and shut up.  Wallace told Zelensky that NATO was not a free Amazon service !  The rest of the weaklings in NATO have no say, they will do what the US says."
"If the West had given modern 4 Gen airpower (F-16 or F/A-18) a year ago, we wouldn't be sitting here watching this."
it has already failed. clown is busy stealing for the day he will leave
How can you defeat a super power like RUSSIA with 7000 nukes ? Stop dreaming and fooling yourself..
"The F16s will only arrive end of the year, which is winter. Ukraine will be bogged down by the snow and then the mud, same as this year. So realistically an offensive with proper air support can only take place in June 2024. Will the West have the patience? Also by then, the Russians will have doubled their defensive lines compared to now.."
"Lets be honest, if the Russians had spent months announcing a big counteroffensive and then made the sorts of territorial gains within the first twi months as the Ukrainians just have, every Western media outlet would call the counteroffensive a big failure. I mean, can one really expect a Ukrainian breakthrough now since they obviously have less western equipment than when the counteroffensive started?"
How can you run into a mine field in this day & age  the west have mine blowing charges they could use & give Ukraine jet fighters let the Russians freeze in the trenches in winter like the Germans did in WW2
looks like a massive loss to me! that big chunk of territory.
"Ukraine need some 30 jets with long range air to air missiles to protect the airspace !  There is 
no other way to to do it because you can not defend  600 000 km2  from the ground !
Ukraine simply do not have all the weapons that they need to defend their land !
Russian missiles have longer range and the helicopters can fire out of reach from the Ukrainean manpads !"
Optimism is great and so is wishful thinking but reality is reality. Ukraine is done! The sooner  they realise that the better. A nation cannot survive on donated weapons that too against a military behemoth like Russia.
THE UKRIANIAN NAZIS WILL NEVER SUCCEED
"Today is a historic day. In 1945, the US dropped 2 atomic bombs on Japan. It was the only case in world history. More than 250,000 civilians were killed. The Prime Minister of Japan, speaking today at a commemorative event, did not mention the role of the United States in this crime, but at the same time said that today Russia threatens the world with atomic weapons..... 194506"
Very disappointing word choice I'm checking out of the BBC bye bye.
"I detest clickbait. I dislike propaganda for propagandas sake. Together it's an unforgivable combination. The introductory question presupposes that the counter-offensive has not been successful to date for the Ukrainian forces. I ask you, compared to which standard would one decide the campaign has been a success? Ukraine has cut off supply lines for Russian front lines. They're surrounding Bahkmut, and about to regain this wasteland to Putin's chagrin. They've wreaked havoc with Russian shipping in the Black Sea... Please, do define success?"
"It's clear "" Ukraine is Great Winner. Russia is hopeless loser. """
The mistake the west made was allowing the Russians to fortify the front lines. It's very hard to dislodge a well dug in position.  With out air power supremacy it will be close to impossible.
Optimism is the handbook of fools.
"The longer the war lasts, the more people are killed."
"Is the BBC finally waking up? Ukraine will lose. And why no mention of the 300 000 Ukrainian soldiers killed on the battlefield? Russia's army is far stronger now than it was 2 years ago. A compromise must be found, and fast."
Ukraine is moving much faster than Russia did when trying to take Bahkmut. How long was that? Over a year. One city.
"Let's get to reality .... Nope big no ! 
They started the offensive on 5th June ! They so far claimed only 5 Km ! That's it ! It failed!! Same BBC told the whole world when Russia were pushed out kyiv just in a week Russia failed... So it's a failed counteroffensive"
"I can't help being cynical about the various reports, most of them are uplifting, telling us very positive developments on the Ukrainian side. Only a week or so ago, Blinken did a song and dance about how well the Ukraine Summer Offensive has done. ""1/2 the territory had been re-taken"" according to his ""insightful"" report.

Anyone who has the minutest cynical bone knows that isn't the case. But talking up to give own side an injection of morale boosting drug is good for the TV, but still results do really matter, and Ukraine is far from doing VERY well.

The first analysis from Frank Gardner is more truthful and is believable. Geography doesn't lie. What about the second commentator Mick Ryan? Well, he is one of the cheerleaders in the western camp. He is a regular on the ABC Australia handing out glorious assessments of the western camp. But credit to the BBC, it provided two commentators instead of the usual ex-generals, ex-intelligence officials.

Judging by the way things are moving, Zelensky will need his entire lifetime to retake Crimea, if that is even remotely possible. He just might have to contend with the 80% of what is left and call it Even Steven."
"'That  will happen anything soon'is synonymous to it's not gonna happen

The wEst is gradually waking up"
The stormshadow and other missiles are rendered imprecise and neutralized by electronic warfare of the russians.
God Bless Russia for they are doing the Lords work in Ukraine.
its already failed
Liars !!!
This bloke's hair is totally unnatural. The black hair dye is too dark and the curves and length is inappropriate for an old man.
The counteroffensive is OVER. FAILED.
Slava Nigeri!
Where is all the Nato and USA munitions support to suppress the Russian munitions? Will Nato and Biden every provide those munitions to Ukraine?
Ukraine is just a ground where Russia vs USA test their modern weapons
"Everybody must have forgotten that aside from that World War I upset   because of the sudden downfall of the Tsarist government, Russia has NEVER been comprehensively defeated into  complete withdrawl from the battlefront lines  throughout the 20th century. The outlook for Ukraine is very dim indeed, and losing one-fifth of its territory is a near certainty."
"If Europe continues to support Ukraine with arms and supplies, the Ukrainians will win. The Ukrainians advance slowly but in the long run they will defeat the invaders, sooner or later they will win the war."
On average wars last 4 to 6 years .So this is just the beginning. Ukraine needs air power. Without air power its almost impossible.
Slava Ukraine. Fuck Russia.
"I'm neutral. My point of view, it is not because who win or lose, 
waste time, effort, & Big Bucks Their family waited peacefully. 
for their comeback. That's what the whole world wanted to see. 
SEALED PEACEFUL AGREEMENT AMONG THEM, saves both. 
Army and warfare equipment for security. My tears. Keep on 
           falling to see this: Are we human? But instead, 
we can see PEACEFUL & HARMONY ENVIRONMENT, K Guys"
Slava ukraini!
"""Can it still succeed?"" It can if NATO pulls its finger out and gets jets to Ukraine and stops restricting its option so they can attack Russian cities to divert Russian forces away from Crimea. Ukraine strongest strategy is mobility and it cannot use it on a minefield.
Honestly, NATO is fkn useless"
"The Western media diligently keep silent about the real situation of the Ukrainian army in the war and do not tell the truth. Because if people find out the real truth, then there will be a real shock in the West. People in Europe and the United States are not ready to learn the real truth about this war. People in the West are told that everything is fine with them , but this is absolutely not the case . The Ukrainian army has failed"
"Shameful to support Ukraine for the war, kick US away from Europe, then peace will arrive to your door step."
"No. And I'm one of the millions of Americans who are fed up with Zelenksy and Ukraine. And when we pull the plug of this war machine, turn out the lights, the party's over."
Ukraine will never win. #LongLiveMotherRussia
"We gave them all that mostly 60s stuff we were going to decommission and no air power. Why are they going so slow against heavily fortified positions that took months to build? Say Western experts who have zero experience with this type of warfare and would never send their ground forces in under such conditions. 

BTW, it wasn't the Ukrainians who decided they couldn't wait for air power. It was the impatient West that pressured them into this suicide mission."
"The BBC already  know that Ukraine have failed and cannot  succeed, so why dont they just admit it, and tell the truth for once."
"Glory to russia and putin urraaa russia urraaa putin urraaa  ,"
No it cant learn to COPE  bbc
"The Ukrainian counteroffensive failed. All Ukrainian military equipment was destroyed, which was supplied by the West. The losses of the Ukrainian army are catastrophic. Ukraine has no resources . Ukraine has only one way out - it is to sit down at the negotiating table with Russia and give Russia its eastern territories. There is no other way"
can Ruzzia win ?
"I think people forget this will be a long term conflict, short term gains mean little to nothing in this war, eventually something will crack for Russia at home, as Ukraine holds the most important asset TIME."
easier said than done. Please be patient and give the Ukrainians an infinite amount of time to succeed. Ukrainians is not in a good shape either. They too had suffered a lot of casualties too making their life no better than hell
"The problem for Ukraine isn't undergrowth, undergrowth, etc.

The problem is that the West clearly says it wants Russia not to win - but their actions they show they desperately wish Russia not only to conquer all of Ukraine but also conquer after the Ukraine Moldowa and then Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and then move into the Baltic conquer these countries too and then advance into Poland, Bulgaria, Romania..

So the actions of the west where they continue to finance Russia and support Russia - doesn't match the words where they claim they want Russia to fail.

Officially, according to Eurostat March 29 2023, the EU wires Russia every month 6 Billion net cash to sustain its war effort. In total over 2022 the EU wired net cash 120 billion EUR to Russia.

When you consider Russia spends only 60 Billion on it's military, it's fair to say European Union is more than 100% financing the war in Ukraine.

While Ukraine is getting 1 billion or so a month from its European partners, Russia is getting still 6 Billion net cashflow every month from its European allies. Especially Germany is the biggest financier of Russia and as Scholz pointed out:""Russia can be assured Germany will do everything in it's power to ensure Russia is going to conquer all of Europe""

While Putin for this year increased the Russian defense budget to 1,5 fold - EU continues to pay 100% of all the Russian military costs.

So while Russia is getting the funds for big long range attack weapons and finance Su-57 and T-14 tanks... Ukraine is getting outdated 1980 stuff, which would cost dozens of billions of EUR/USA to dismantle them.. and dispose of this outdated stuff. But now you just give it to the Ukrainians - and then it costs you 0."
"There is 0 chance zelensky win this war but he can keep ukrainin to suffer more for his interst to US his master 
He should step down and be neutral like Afghamistan"
Kinda makes you realize how ineffective western armoured vehicles are in combat.
Far be it for me to intimate the contrary!
Godspeed brave Ukraine's counteroffensive! Slava Ukraini! Give Ukraine all the arms it needs - including F16s! Give Ukraine time.
"Ukrainian offensive predictably failed, what a shocker. The West is drunk on propaganda, as per usual."
Ukraine shuoldnt try offensive without F16 it was mistake too to give russians time to build defence lines
Somme all over again for Ukraine. Taking land isnt the point. Destroying the enemy is the key.
They cannot win unless Sun Tzu is advising them. And they have fuckin Biden? WTF
Measuring progress against a 24hr news cycle with predictable results.
"""Campaigns in 2024 and beyond.""
Any idea when Ukraine will officially declare war?"
What poll is that? They did not ask me about the opinion. Just what kind of morons common senseless dum-bas idiots vote against supporting Ukraine that is our war! What kind of idiots are they voting against supporting Ukraine! USA
"From 1944 until 1952 the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UIA) were engaged in an armed struggle against the communists. As a result of the skirmishes between the UIA and Soviet units, the Soviets deported 600,000 people from these territories and in the process 170,000 of the local population were killed in the fighting."
Another expert with an opinion-Hmmm-were these the same ones that said the Russians would be in Kyiv within a week and Zelensky would flee.You don't need to be an expert to work out the Russians will lose-the only variable is how long this will take.
BBC you are the most hypothetical institution.  Why continue the lie ?
"NBC News headline: ""Is Ukraine's counteroffensive failing? Kyiv and its supporters worry about losing control of the narrative"" (4th Aug 2023)
Allow yourself time to think about the second part of this headline.
If you still believe that the MSM is giving you an accurate and balanced picture of this confllict, you need to wake up."
"Flat out, Ukraine needs carpet bombers to break through the Russian defenses.  That would blow up the mines & dragon's teeth, & flush out the trenches.  Air power, such as the long-awaited F-16's & heavy carpet bombers would make a lot of difference, Ukraine's friends & allies.  Time to stop dripping support into the country like a leaky faucet.  In any case, if Ukraine makes real progress in pushing Russia out, the war could very well be over that much quicker.  SLAVA UKRAINI!"
No
Nearly 400billion in weapons from Western countrys ..russia have adapted and can not lose....some of the stingers sent to ukraine have ended up in mexican cartel hands already....war for warmongers
"US-NATO and proxy ukraine has lost and Russia has won.... There is nothing US-NATO can do about it... Russia will end this when they are ready. 
EU-UK has lost much than Ukraine - UK-EU public just have not woken up to the destruction  their leadership has done... !"
"Ukraine rain season starts August-September, so not 3 months anymore.
By September all big offensives will end. Then ground will need to freeze, if it ever going to happen, because it never happened in winter 2022/2023."
Those pro Ukrainian soldiers who crossed over into Russian territory could lay mines in Russia so as to interfere with supplies.
"We continue to forget that Ukraine is fighting a super power , no matter how much ridiculed they have become . This is a formidable opponent with hundreds of years in experience for conventional warfare"
"The thing is, armies are armed construction crews. Read through Caesars Commentaries on the Gallic Wars, and from then till now, armies are hosts of diggers and builders who know how to fight secondarily. 

Russia, expecting the counter-offensive, has put work into building line, after line, after line of defences. If Ukraine wants to make real progress, they have to take ground faster than defences can be constructed, which at the moment isn't really the case. The aerial and naval aspects of warfare are almost moot, because both nations have strong anti-air and anti-naval weaponry. 

Can the counter-offensive succeed? I'm starting to say no, there simply is no way, even with better tactics, that the rate of advance can outpace the rate of russian defensive construction.

Can Ukraine still win the war? Definitely. Even with a massive defensive advantage, Ukrainian counter offensives have made ground, and we're quickly seeing Russia's internal sphere collapse, nationalised industries like Gazprom starting its own mercenary army, dissent in the army and more and more civil unrest at home. If Ukraine is to win, I think it'll be through attrition of morale, which Ukraine certainly has more of than Russian conscripts.

That's just my thoughts though, I can't claim any authority on what I think."
"If Ukraine is really winning, with what the western medias keep saying.
Then I delete my account and will not get in touch with social media anymore."
How does the aid Ukraine is receiving compare with what the UK received in WWII ?
Peanuts in dollar value and systems no one is providing to them.

There was lots of evidence that Russia was a cruel aggressive gangster state and a blemish on humanity even before 2014.
"Russia must lose this war, in the name of God."
"How do you expect the Ukraine to win, when you supply them with only a handful of storm shadows and a handful of vehicles? The fact that they manage to hold out at all, is testament to their resolve and bravery. The Ukrainians need a lot more equipment and they also need warplanes to win."
What the Fark - getting an Australian to give a report on the Ukrainian war???? He only knows what the Americans tell him - this is a sign your are getting desperate to get a positive report
I love this Australian general ..  no wonder they lost THE GREAT EMU WAR to the birds:))))))
"NATO needs to start to worry about the blowback from this stupid, world affecting war of choice. Belarus is now a nuclear power, Iran will be soon and now has hypersonic missiles and the brand new Su-35s to deliver them.

"Subsonic, Supersonic and Hypersonic shovels are doing a great work"
"Well, it won't be if the US and NATO fail to supply them adequately. I don't think they lack the will, just the equipment (which NATO doesn't seem hurried to provide)."
Zelensky has the license to kill
Ukraine doing better than Britain could ever dream of doing....
"The counter-offensive failed the moment it became painfully public what weapons were being sent to Ukraine and what regions the attack would most likely be conducted in. It gave Russia advance notice of what preparations were needed to blunt the counter-offensive. 

Example: A Russian Defensive Planners Job.

1) What is the enemy's equipment? Answer = Western Tanks

2) How are they supposed to be used? Answer = In large forces that quickly punches through an enemy position and then immediately moves on.

3) How do I keep them from being used that way? Answer = Make them only be used in small groups, slow them down, and concentrate fire on them.


4) Are there any examples of these weapons being destroyed in the past? Answer = Yes, Leopards in Syria.

5) What available options are there?
Answer:
Mines can slow them down. 
Artillery can easily concentrate fire on them when they are moving slowly.

Russian air power deters Ukraine from assembling large enough tank forces. 

6) Can we get these defenses set up before the enemy arrives? Answer = Yes we have months of advance notice thanks to Western media and politicians.

how long did it take england to beat germany
So eternal war. Good old ww1 style stalemate
"God I hate the BBC bloody armchair analysts without a clue - there are times when I feel I'm watching a russian propaganda channel.  There used to be an offence of giving aid and support to the enemy.  Time to revisit that offence.  Hell it has only been two months and Russia were trying to take Bakhmut for nearly a year.  Progress is slow, but what the hell do you expect, there is no Ukrainian Air Superiority with which to use a a precursor to an assault.  So things are naturally going to be taken slowly and or change tactics, which appears to be happening. It really is time to unsubscribe from this channel it just makes me angry."
"In the minds of the Western media, yes.

In reality, absolutely not."
How about air superiority and giving them the ability to strike Russian territory?
"Ukraine is running out of time.  The rain is coming and Trump is too.  US primaries start on January 2024.  Trump is opposed to this war and will get his base to put pressure on Republicans supporting this conflict to stop.  This is why the West pushed Ukraine to do this disastrous counteroffensive.  Ukraine and Nato are about to lose in 3 months time.

Tic toc tic toc."
On the internet everything Ukraine does is a pure win and Russia always fails
"Ukrainian DEAD now estimated at 450,000. Let that sink in. How many Americans died in WWII, Korea and Vietnam? Well, I can answer that - approx 495,000. If there are 450,000 Ukrainian Dead over the period of approx one year, that will mean that by the end of this year it is VERY likely Ukraine will surpass 495,000. ALL FOR ABSOLUTELY NOTHING - ALL ON THE WHIM OF A BUNCH OF CHAMPAGNE SIPPING SUPER RICH GLOBALIST WEF PIGS. As the propaganda sticker of the joint WWII US/Cdn First Special Service Force proclaimed DAS DICKT ENDE KOMMT NOCH!  THE WORST IS YET TO COME for Ukraine and the collective globalists of the West. God is ON THE MOVE and JUSTICE IS COMING FOR THE WARMONGERING MURDERING EVIL PIGS OF THIS WORLD."
This smells like a pile of pootin
Are you guys idiots?? Or just ttoally unaware of things around you?
only counter offensive they can start is counter strike 1.6
But ukraine is winning... right?
It is successful in Zelenskies dream.
"What is happened with german tanks 
Europe was campaigning for few months that german tanks will defeat Russia in 2-3 months!!
Where the aircraft will land in Ukraine!??
In zelensky sitting rooms???"
"Ukraine is really stuffed if they are having to report honestly now, the offensive was a failure and they died for nothing."
"The upcoming winter isn't a 'fake timeline', wtf does Australia know about battlefields...LMAO"
"The question 'Ukraine counter-offensive: Can it still succeed?' itself means the war is lost, and it is sinking into the west.  'Still win' means there is big doubt.

The fact that the US vetoed Ukraine's entry into NATO and refused to give a time line is clear evidence that the US now sees Ukraine is a loser.

The west knows it is defeated but cannot say it.   Now they admit the Russians have been innovative and not as dumb as the west thought.   But they will add that western equipment is superior - although the results show the opposite !  They did not want to show the graphic results.

Now the latest is Ukraine's advance is thwarted by weeds !"
To the last Ukraine has meaning
A European negotiated peace is the logical and sane choice. Continuing to support the US led proxy war against Russia is destroying Ukraine and Europe citizens grow poorer by the day as their public money is wasted in Ukraine.
Ukraine was defeated a long time ago and the BBC and NATO are now trying to start WW3.
Oh yeah the bbc ask why haven't they broken thru?? Well its because they have no DAMM AIR POWER! GIVE THEM AIRPOWER! I served in the US Army and we used air power in 1991 to break thru the Iraqi defenses in a matter of hours by pummeling it and using dozers and other mine clearing devices. In fact we learned how to put two Anti tank mines on top of each other in the 80s! Its nothing new.

1 Thessalonians, chapter 4, verse 16-17.

*""in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.""*
1 Corinthians, chapter 15, verse 52.

*""I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left. Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left. Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.""*
Luke, chapter 17, verse 34-36.
..............."
Why doesnt the Ukraine receive them type helicopters  . Should have a year ago .
I'm sure it can make bank for a few corrupt liberals
the lancet
A few months ago the reconstruction of Ukraine excluding DonBass was valued at 434 billion euros. What about today?
Send unmanned vehicles to clear mine fields to break through the occupied areas into two parts
storm shadows are almost gone and the scalps that may have replaced them are going to be pointed at africa now instead of russia arent they?
"Well I guess they're slowly changing the narrative as it all comes crashing down like every sane person knew it would. But hey, it's not our people who are dying over there so who cares right? 

""insert random comment about freedom and democracy"""
Biden and his government bear the fault for not supporting the long range weapons. He lost my vote next year.
"Wow, so many Russian trolls. Russia cannot advance forward through its own minefields. Are they going to sit in the trenches forever? Winter is cold for everyone."
Give Ukraine the Fighter Jets it needs. Shame on Biden for not making this a priority. He is using Ukraine blood for his agenda.
Let's all say sod it find a field all meet up like the good old days and fight all over
Let them take as long as they want
"Where are the peace negotiations?  Where are the talks?  The west should cut supplies to Ukraine, we are not interested in spending tax payer money on this proxy war."
"Its a measure of success that the Ukraine is disappointed in their counter offensive given during the first days of the invasion, no one expected them to even hold any part of their country against a military super power with largest supply of natural resources of any country.  In fact given Russia is the largest country with the most natural resources you have to wonder how incompetent a leader you have to be to have your country end up in such a state"
"I remember that in Bakhmut Wagner simply had mercenaries available that he sent to die at the front to advance. Maybe Ukraine will not be given the same opportunity, it is clear that they are doing well. It is necessary to improve the production and logistics of weapons, air support (F16) and long range weapons."
bbc sent tanks and missiles for news
Ukraine and supporters are fighting a failed war. Ukraine can never win this war.
Ukraine has taken back 50% of the land first occupied
"It's been two months of a counter-offensive and the only thing Ukraine has gained is the death of tens of thousands of it's men.
End the war. Stop the bomb dropping. Start the negotiations NOW.....which are inevitable anyway."
So you guys think this is ok what Russia doing and y the you guys  talking like you have ever been in war you no nothing about this so don't say that its going slow stop talking and go out there and help them all of you people that all you do is talk about things you don't have any idea about peace
The Ukies need to listen to the Germans. Their instructors told them to drive around the minefields.
2024 counter offensive now which means there will be endless war in Ukraine and its not good for normal working person like me
The ukraine offensive is successful in their heart.
"We spend $900B a year on weapons, Russia spends $90B a year. They have fought us to a draw for 18 months. Something ain't right...."
Just look at the rate of Russian losses. Russia can not sustain these losses for much longer. If Ukraine can sustain this fight then Russia's defeat is inevitable.
no it cant succeed
Oh come on! Ukraine doesn't have to win this summer! Will the pissing west put its business-timetabled-mindset to one side for f sake.
"If even the BBC are acknowledging Russian strengths, then Ukraine's situation must be dire indeed."
"""Ukraine counter-offensive: Can it still succeed? - BBC News""---- If it succeeds, the future of NATO must be discussed right now...To be dissolved or to be strengthened more  to face the new threat: the ukrainian threat.."
Stupid war strategy by Ukraine.  Simply need equipment from the West and carpet bomb the mine fields. After that its clear sailing to the trenches.
"Damn! They stack two mines??? That's crazy, a Def KO for any encounter."
Wow so many experts commenting
"Newscaster could do with some more sleep, a double espresso and a cold shower. Lacks pace and urgency.,"
"Should make priority hitting SP artillery.   It is vital to eliminate rapidly deployable elements, reducing battlefield artillery support to any area in need or for the sake of obfiscation."
"My prediction is that America will grow tired of supporting Ukraine, and Ukraine will be defeated. I support Ukraine and wish them well, but in the end, all that the US and allies will have done is give false hope to Ukrainians, so many many more Ukrainians have and will die than if they  would have surrendered to Russia from the beginning. I hope I'm wrong."
"5 NATO trained brigades were gone for 6 villages.
25000 Ukrainian casualties. I dont think ii is worth it"
Not as long as Biden does everything he can to slow down the Ukrainian army.
30 countries can't make their stooge win an army fighting with shovels.. LMAO
When does the counter offensive end lol
"The offensive has gone like the battle of Kursk a complete failure. The storm shadows are only limited numbers in supply. Ukraine is in a race with the seasonal change, the Russian military can prepare for their own counter move likely from Belarus or from the bridgehead in the Luhunsk/Kharkiv border area"
Russia's no super power Ukraine as proved that
Also NATO tanks and armored vehicles are that are given to Ukraine are not prepared for the new type of warfare which includes antitank drones and missiles.  NATO has some catching up to do.
NATO has hemmed and hawed about support. First tanks and infantry fighting weapons and next year possibly F16s and Swedish jet fighters. France has given Ukraine jet fighters but Ukrainian pilots don't know how to fly them yet. Our support is piecemeal at best. The US says that they know what Ukraine needs but does not give it until England does. The US army would never be making 1:1 ratio attacks that Ukrainian army is forced to do without first pulverizing the enemy for weeks of air attacks and first attaining air superiority. We are expecting the Ukraine military to work wonders without attack helicopters and jet fighters. They are making good incremental progress with what they have.  The Russian army is also proving that our antimine equipment is not enough.  The US army is not prepared to go through these kinds of mine fields either.
It is boots on the ground that mark victory not missile strikes. If Ua had a huge arsenal of missiles to hit Russia it would not move the AFU forward. The AFU absolutely must do better because support will wane soon if there is little to show. I don't like it but that is the way it is.
The gnome of Kiev will get everybody killed.
#FreeDanielPenny
"Define 'succeed'. Ukraine can still achieve a glorious media victory to pump their fists on. But, they'll completely destroy their army doing it. Russia is currently just absorbing the attack, waiting for Ukraine to commit their army to an objective and then they'll start their own offensive in the North and probably the South, when Ukraine cant redeploy forces to stop them. Russia's army is learning, expanding and getting progressively stronger, while Ukraine is running out if everything and has clearly demonstrated that they're army is incompatible with Western training and doctrine; theyre unable to accept and implement NATO standard TTPs, or utilize Western equipment."
"Ukraine and Zelensky thinks they are protecting democracy and european way of life fighting russia, and they feel they we owe ukraine for that. But lowkey the west is thinking, ukraine should have not looked for trouble in the first place and thinks all this action is a liability to everyone."
Ukraine has already won. Everyone but NK and Belarus can see nazi russias plan.
Russia's scrap yards and fertilizer industry are booming. Thank you for abundant supplies. Keep delivering...indefinitely...for Earth.
Yes ... I really hate Russian Propaganda .....
"A defeatist headline the editor should be sacked, why are we paying a licence fee for these people."
"Cogratulations to BBC for telling the truth. The counteroffensive has failed and the rainy season will soon arrive, stopping offensive action. The lady expert admitted that Ukraine will not retake Crimma, the whole purpose of the war. Thank you for being truthful."
"If you ever feel useless , remember usa spend 20 years to replace taliban with taliban"
"""Ukrainians are doing well"" at least 
300.000 dead so far"
"The more I listen to these type of western military assessments/analysis the more I realize that the end result is a shallow short-sighted menu of inept conclusions made by western style judgements. The actual fact is that Ukraine succeeded in striking a major strategic defeat to Russia and has rendered it as paper-tiger super power that is capable of being defeated. It is now only a matter of time whether Ukraine will be enabled to force Russia to heal, or if western resolve will wain enough for Russia to militarily rectify its gross errors. If the objective is to allow Ukraine to restore its borders and bring Russia to a peace table then it must be allowed to strike key centers on Russian territory, gain Air and Sea superiority, and have unconditional long-term sustainable support without any fear of crossing 'red' lines."
"Wow. The gap between MSM and the objective media is sometimes so great, you really sometimes wonder if you can even tell what is real and what isn't. Over on the objective media (non-Western news) the debate is more along the lines of: Worst offensive in history? Gallipoli? Fredericksburg? Here is BBC still wondering if it can succeed."
This could be a 30 year war
Keep calm! Ukraine is winning!
From capturing Crimea by July to questioning the success. It'd would be worthwhile by reporting honestly and transparently. Stop with the fairytale propaganda and tell us how hard the war actually is.
"Ukraine doesn't want to drag this out because it's afraid that the US may have a new president come 2024, who may not be as supportive towards them as President Joe Biden has been. Also, there is concern that the other western leaders may be distracted by other issues and weaken their support for Ukraine too.

On another note, this counteroffensive may be sped up if the West allowed Ukraine to use the long-range weapons to hit military targets within Russia without any restrictions. Specifically the eastern-most regions of Russia. If Russia's ability to support their troops is severely weakened, then those troops fighting on the frontlines will cave more quickly if put under sustained fire and their frontline will collapse sooner. And with no more support in the rear, their retreat will likely have to be all the way back to Russia, hence giving up all that territory in the Donbas, Crimea and Melitopol areas."
"BBC: Ukraine has achieved nothing in 2 months, but it wins!
I might not have watched this video, everything is as usual clear"
Fu...k ukraine! Fu...k nazists ! Fu....k nato !
get russia out of ukraine even if it takes years
"I am sure it will be fine. They have a 5ft2 Green T-Shirt wearing gnome that is willing to get them all killed , while touring the world ..."
"After just watching oppenheimer,  this counter offensive is very boring"
Russians steal Ukrainian children to abuse them thinking this will help them conquer Ukraine...
"At this point Ukraine has lost over 300,000 KIAs, half its population, 24% of its territory( where 80% of its GDP was produced) 30% of its NATO supplied weapons, blown through 200 billion USD... and now are resorting to strategically useless desperation attacks(bordering on terrorism) and a (counteroffensive) that consists of driving into minefields where their Leopards & friends get  stuck and $40,000 Lancet 3 UAVs take out 11 million $ Panzers and the infantry trying desperately to retreat under artillery barrages.This war is a complete US proxy catastrophe with 0 explanation of what a Ukrainian victory would look like even if the same Iraq/Afghanistan/Libya/Syria... geniuses in the Pentagon actually had a plan that wasn't 2+2=coconut."
"By 2024 there won't be no Ukrainian soldiers left,  Zelenskey will be in UK or in US claiming asylum."
"Billions more come on nato give give all your money to Ukraine, forget about your own citizens , always money for war never money for the poor so sad"
A bit late to wonder if you can win a fight...
russia will win .............. the west is on a decline..
Send them the F16. Germany EU said yes. They need air cover
Obviously not going to succeed  .
It would definitely succeed if they were given the f-16s they need. Stop drip feeding weapons to Ukraine and they'll succeed for sure.
Foolish and illogical debates on counter offensive ... west has failed ukraine tiger warriors by providing outdated poor defensive weapons for offensive operations against a psychopath super power .... ukraine has already proven its metal to whole world but west is hell bent to push ukraine against russia with tied hands .. pathetic west strategy
"British intelligence thinks that the Ukrainians need a lawn mower, because the weeds are getting in the way of the counter offensive! What is this here?"
Failed!!!!!!;
You mean no progress lol slow progress oh come on . They are going to the slaughter house
this war still going on?
Remember the thousands dead already and that is not ok with no win in the end mercy since you push them to  that situation that you make believe that they can win.
"I say ukraine should just keep throwing young men at the problem. 

America has given enough money to the ukrainian elites for them to waste poor peoples lives, for effectively nothing."
"Why the hell would they attack them.  FLANK, FLANK and FLANK.  YOU DO NOT NEED TO ATTACK.  YOU NEED TO SURROUND.   DO IT."
True but selective and biased
"People must not forget Russia is a global superpower alongside America and China, despite challenges Russia still has one of the best and powerful militaries in the world, they still has vast military resources it can count on, unlike Ukraine who have to rely on American and NATO military weapons and aid, don't forget Russia still hasn't use the full force of its military might, so I wouldn't bet against Russia to prevail in this conflict."
"Free world, NOTHING OF VALUES IN THIS WORLD IS EASY. Of course, Ukraine can still win, provided the free world is not half-hearted behind Ukraine. The free world should be as brave as the Ukrainians and fully support Ukraine. Where are the F16s?"
"The west are demonstrating just how weak and feeble their hand-wringing democracies are. The west don't want Ukraine to win this war, if they did then they would have said so and armed Ukraine with the equipment to win it."
It will be alright.
"""The Russians are running out of missiles"", ""The defenses are useless"", ""They are fighting with shovels from WW2"" ------ ""Can it still succeed?"""
Ukraine counter offensive = send Zelensky unaccountable billions. Ukraine rebuilding = send Zelensky more unaccountable billions.
counter-offensive doesn't really exist they still trying to defend and russians are taking land everyday
Time isn't a measure to success ok. Ukraine is loosing manpower and amor. Why can't west stop this war
what are you expect from these inexperience  specialist this is bullshit real specialist cant see media because they are truth teller.
You can't fight conventional war against a much larger enemy - so you fight a guerilla style war - blowing that dam and stopping the attack on Kiev forcing the Russians on defensive was the turning point in the war - drones attacks on Moscow - hold the Russian armies in their trenches and attack the Russian heartland - No.1 Demolition Squadron should be formed specifically to attack the Moscovite fuel supplies and ammo dumps within Russia - drone attacks on Russian ships - The War of a Thousand Cuts
"THIS War go on for 7 years,

Well done USA for stalling the weapons delivery's to give Russia time to build their defences. It's as if they have dementia.
is the jornalist drunk ?
All your Russian oil tankers and combat ships are belong to drone
"All for nought and how many teenagers, old men and mercenary casualties are there?"
Can the west eventually give them what they NEED?
Realtalk if Nato want real success the counter offensive sent more capabilities long range missile and helicopter as well us jet fighter and modern air defense.
Why is no one pushing Ukraine to the negotiations table with rusia??
"It's not easy to succeed.  Those mines, I would not advise them to proceed. Let them use drones, not people"
"RuSSia has lost a quarter of its alligator helicopter fleet so far in this conflict - American F-16's are just starting the attack so things should start to progress even further, Russia has lost two major warships, also its uranium enriching plant, several key supply bridges have been destroyed or damaged.  On top of this POOTIN is getting mounting pressure from his own oligarchs to cease the war !!! So things are looking more up but don't expect it to be a push over it will take time as Russia has millions of potential soldiers in reserve. It has had time to dig in and lay minefields which take time to conquer. The weather is still holding. SLAVA UKRAINE !!!!!"
"Could NATO succeed without long range missiles and air power? Nope, they would never have attempted this. The west are failing Ukraine and I'm beginning to think it's intentional."
"They need ATCMS they need F16's, talking about anything else is twoddle.
Expect that to be right before the elections in the US and UK."
What does the media think? Ukraine isn't fighting luxembourg
"You can't fight conventional war with infantry battalion only, you need air power."
It's not a secret for Putin to hire mass actors in Russia! Putin promotes fraud! Because the dictator has lost the support of the Russian people!
"Timeline: 1) Ukraines counteroffensive is already bogged down in what is essentially trench warfare. This will last a couple of more months with the fronts moving a couple of kilometres. Nothing to speak of in Europes second largest country. 2) Russia will attempt a new winter offensive. Fronts will move a couple of kilometres, nothing to speak of in Europes second largest country. 3) Support from the west will start to wane simply because if given the choice - supporting a war 2000 km away or functional hospitals in your city, people will choose functional hospitals. 4) Ukraine will attempt a desperate new offensive, nothing much will be gained, fronts will perhaps move a couple of km but again nothing much in Europes second largest country. At the end of the offensive Ukraine will settle on a defensive posture and try to absorb Russias attacks. 5) Russia will attempt a new winter offensive and gain very little. 6) Peace will be negotiated, eastern Ukraine will be taken by Russia, Ukraine will be barred from access to NATO but gain entry to the EU."
Let's end this already or it looks like it could drag on for years. And I'm TOTALLY with Ukraine.
"What i don't understand is why the Crimea bridge is still operational. Surely if these long range missiles are effective then you would smash that link and cut off a huge part of Russian army from food and ammunition. Then the seige tactics work for you and no need to try and break through in south, you can move forces to east and use high range himars to better effect?"
Only the British could seek solace in grass and the weather
1941 1942 1943
Let's see how these doubters would go through these minefields and then give a time line.
"Have the Russians stated how many Nazis they have taken out so far? It seems as if they are more concerned about keeping the land they are occupying than eliminating Nazis. And if they are really eliminating Nazis, why isn't Israel helping them or the Jews living in Ukraine? The Russian narrative just doesn't add up ..."
"""Too graphic to show""... All pictures are by definition graphic. 
Use appropriate vocabulary BBC."
US Europe does not support them because their fighters are more expensive than Ukrainians.
Had Ukraine stayed neutral - none of this would have happened. It was illegal for it to join NATO to begin with.
great analysis from the Australian General
Both are good in defense and they're also both sucks in offense
So this is all against the National Socialist  Workers' Party (nazis) of Ukraine?
"IN short, Ukraine is winning.."
"Ukraine counter-offensive: Can it still succeed? 
It is succeeding"
Hahahah yes in media propaganda they win but in the battle  impossible
I mentioned this many times from a year ago. Peace is the best immediate solution. Otherwise this war goes on until Ukraine be out of man power and in a full failed state. This is happening. Unfortunately Ukraine has no real politician that understands realities and counting on UK or USA which shows in such war their weapons and power etc. all hyped and can become ineffective. This is not Iraq war.
"It IS secceeding. Just not at the speed we all wish. Had the Ukrainians received the Equipment last year, Putin would be History now."
you kill a snake by the head not by the tail.
If Ukraine wants to be a part of nato cede land to Russia and join
THEY SHOULD GO TO MOSCOW
Slava Ukraine
"Can it still succeed? Go ask the 35,000 Ukrainian soldiers that are dead and the hundreds of tanks and IFVs including the games changer leopards and Bradley's that have been obliterated DURING THE LAST 60 DAYS"
"No F-16's because of Medvedez's tactical nuke threats. Now Leopards are being hit all over. Bunch of clowns in the west running everything.  If a country can be bullied, then the bully wins every time. Time to take of the gloves."
"Maybe we wouldn't have this discussion if we had supplied Ukraine with everything they need, such as atacms and f16s.  Wasted so much time.  What a joke"
The Ukrainian army has failed. measuring their progress is like trying to get a pulse from a corpse in the morgue.
no
"Doing okiy, mite, with 43,000 deaded.."
"If I was Ukraine, they will stop killing their own people for the West. They will never defeat Russia in the battlefield."
24hours Ukraine Ukraine Ukraine WTF happening to all western countries news channel.Show something from Russia also lol
bushes and tall grass interfere with the counteroffensive
Take some B-52s in there with a Ukrainian pilot in the left seat. That would clear out the Russians along with everything in the way for a strategic breakthrough. Send in F-16s as well for support in air superiority.
Russian society appears unable to right itself. It took massive bombardment followed by foreign occupation to persuade German and Japanese society to abandon their aggressive dominance-seeking.
"The allies have seen too many films where the underdog wins.  What they need to do is equip Ukraine to be the over-dog. Air power, sea power. The ability move a massive force over rivers or sea. What Ukraine needs is the same sort of capability as was employed on D-Day to either 'get off the beaches' against prepared defences, or to go around them, attack on a less prepared front. Perhaps make a direct landing on Crimea. On D-day it was a combined air and sea assault. Disastrous in some places, worked in others."
Thanks to the shrubs and weeds the MSM narrative is changing.
Putin is our papa
Funny that nato and a puppet stare in war front.
You don't protest for your rights! Who will safeguard your rights?
Only the western governments and their brainwashed citizens are the ones cheering on Ukraine to continue this war instead of trying to negotiate for peace with Russia. This is the problem. What would it have cost for Ukraine to have been a neutral state and avoid this war. It is the west and NATO specifically who are the cause of this war when they ignored Russia's concerns of NATO's expansion Eastwards towards it's boarders. No wonder the rest of the world is not in support of the western sanctions against Russia.
no. it can't.
"Whatever! The US sending Cluster Bombs, is all you need to know about how desperate the situation is! Results needed to keep the general MSM media narrative positive and the citizens positive and willing to sacriifce their dayli life comfort for the cause."
"Defense is easy.
Offense is hard.
These lands occupied by Russland is lost."
"Why cant they sacrifice some tanks , 4x4's or even tractors and let drive through mine fields without anybody at the controls? Cluster bombs are being used to do it so why not"
"It is succeeding, albeit slowly, conserving their troops and materiele"
Failed attempts and wasted money
send the F16's asap
That meant Mark Willey.
"Mark willed said about 8 weeks ago, that the Ukrainians had been given everything they need for the counter-offensive.
That's funny coz a few months before that he said he didn't think they would get the Russians out.
I think it's clear now that there will be no clear winners."
Ukraine needs to redirect from reclaiming land and disrupt the Russian oil exports and shipping
Napalm sticks to Russians.  Just a thought.
"so NATO was procrastinating for 6 month instead of giving weapons immediatelly, gave not enough, russians used this 6 month to build defence and now NATO is wondering if Ukraine can succeed"
It is not Ukraine who could not wait for air power - it is the West who delayed delivery of aircraft and long range missiles and failed to train pilots.
All the stupid folks who are nay-sayers and who think Ukraine cannot retake Crimea are the same ones who did not give Ukraine weapons when they needed them.
"All the defensive structures were built by Russia while the West was dragging its feet to supply Ukraine with weapons!  Shame on the cowards, who are ""concerned"" but do nothing."
"This is on the west. They didn't get them air power from 2014 till now. They were too scared of russia to really help. If they held the air, they wouldn't have to worry as much about mines. They could have prevented the mines being placed."
Ukraine is loosing and Russia is now doing a lot of business in Africa and have set them selves up to become even stronger why don't you report on that ??? Fake news !!! Stop lying to people liberal garbage media!
"with all those mines, I guess russia has no intention of advancing? mines don't exactly have friend or foe systems"
"No, no they can't."
"Ukraine did not received any helicopter, figher, attack jet, Abrams, Atacms, they only have received 24x Himars and some 50-60 Tanks. What you want from the Ukraine, which even did not received 30 Abrams from the 5500 in US Stock.,\"
lol!
No. They were never going to win this war. Warmongers assisted by the shill media have got 350k of them killed. Well done muppets.
"I am in disbelief that BBC is finally telling the ""truth"". What has changed?"
"""Overall the Ukrainians are doing ok."" Wrong they needed success like they had last fall. They managed to take a few kilometers worth of fields."
"We knew from last year already that if they did not act fast, the Russians would be able to fortify their positions.  (My comment history can confirm this.)  Everything that has been happening is just outdated WW2 rubbish tactics.  If you want to end this war, just throw some antimatter at Moscow and watch the fireworks.  One of those Mach 10 drones carrying 100 kg of antimatter should do the job fairly easily.  (Probably overkill though.)"
Why do you routinely ignore 'police' corruption in Britain?
"No thanks State Sponsored Propaganda,  Goodbye Ukraine"
"Unlike Putler's approach of hurling meat-charges headlong into slaughter for zero gain, Ukraine is fighting the smart war. Working behind the front lines, using long range precision guided weapons to degrade and destroy essential transport infrastructure, locating and obliterating ammo and fuel dumps, devastating what's left of the Russian navy, forcing them to hide their ships out of range. Implementing ground breaking drone technology that's burying demoralized and unsupported Russians in their own trenches. Ukraine is maximizing Russian losses while minimizing their own. Russia is a hollowed out spent force. They couldn't even hold Snake Island and have failed all their objectives since Putler launched his illegal, genocidal *WAR* on the sovereign nation of Ukraine. Run, Ivan, run."
"the west need to admit that ukraine lost the war and this will not happen as it is their war and they don't want the public to turn against their failed leaders
time is now to show some courage and to call Russians to avoid hostilities instead of calling for a peace conference in saudi arabia without Russians"
Day 60 of Ukraine's 7-day counter offensive.
"When BBC admits russian forces are massacring ukrainian (us backed) forces, we can be sure things are looking real bad for Ukrainians"
Of course it will
For those of us who have been following milbloggers. We know that as much as the Ukrainians have heart they don't have enough to win against a stiff defense. Videos of Russian drone strikes and that one tank defeating 8 Ukrainian vehicles so how long this will go on
Too bad GOD is on Putin's side!

The offensive has failed to achieve anything. They already tired everything and now it's time to accept Putin's peace terms. No point in sending men to their deaths with no gains to show for it.
my god. so many arm armchair strategists in these comments.
"Missing the old USSR, it seems."
"If it doesn't succeed, it's only a matter of time before all of Europe is being attacked by Russia..."
All those lives lost..all that money on wepons that havent made a difference..The Russians have laid minefeilds to stop the Ukrainian advance.. Woww.. who could have seen that coming..? A peace deal that wants the winning side to pull back further than it was before the war started..Is the collective west led by clowns..?
"What Ukraine needs is a large fleet of JCBs, perhaps upto a thousand. So that they can simultaneously dig 30-40 parallel roads across the mined frontline, each 2-3 feet deep, 8-10 feet wide and each separated by about 1-2 km. Backed with artillary (tank) and air defense cover. All these backhoes will not only dig roads for tanks while clearing mines, but if properly done these wide trenches will shift the ukrainian frontline eastward directly towards Russian first line of defence.

The excavated soil can also act as cover for the backhoes and infantry alike. Slowly and steadily."
We still need nuclear deterrence or biological weapon to prevent war.
The Lord our God.
"The decision was taken months ago that instead of sending a huge Ukrainian force into certain slaughter by attacking a very well defended intrenchment Ukraine would hold the line with forces waiting to attack and holdout until the economic situation in Russia had bitten deep. Today the Russian Rubel is losing about 1 Rubel a day against the dollar and to prevent this Putin's war chest is dwindling fast as huge government funds are being spent trying to insulate the population, the Russian governments subsidies on imports alone are huge to prevent massive inflation, the cost of this war to Russia's economy can not continue. The economic data coming out of Russia is just a pure fabrication from a regime known for lying and the IMF use this data with impunity.  Harvard school of economics who have studied the data hard to fake has said they are close to collapse despite building one of the biggest war chests any country has ever built, waiting will be the order of the day as the West's goal is the total collapse of Russia and their eventual break up that will end the threat for good and will also teach China not to get too cocky."
a few F16's will not make superiority in the air...
Sorry. It can't
Nope
"Looks BBC is sponsoring the war.. 
Can BBC show why west is supporting the war why can't it be shown that how will it be stopped?"
They said it will be easy pisy lemon squizzy like the kharkov offensive due to incompetent Russian will runaway seeing game changing western armour(Tanks and IFVs) which are now blown up and piled up along with Ukraine hopes of breakthrough
"Full scale???!!! Again, BBC invited an ""expert""! According to previous ""experts"", Russia run out of missiles last year, run out of weapons 6 months ago, run out of food, money and soldiers. The question is: whom NATO/Ukraine is fighting there?"
"UA started as it means to go on , and operations are still subject to heavy security  !"
Mines needs technology-based solution use ground drones locate mine feild then tractor with tiller
Defund the BBC!
American soldiers are fighting Syrians and Russians in Syria right now.
It's all over make a deal
"""Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.""

Mike Tyson."
"No, it can not"
Ukraine never win against Russia
"Good question BBC, what will be your next good question, can a baby lift an elephant?
You should ask Col. Douglas Mcgregor if you want the truth about the war, but of course they wont because all they do is propaganda."
From defense to offense. There are no negotiations even on the table.
war?? western media keep calling it war! if Russia really wants war there will be nothing left in Ukraine. but hey Ukraine loves nazi.
"Ukraine must give back lands it stole from Hungary, Poland and Romania."
"'BBC security correspondent', not even hilarious. With global totalitarian system use totalitarianism of the mass media conducted by Pentagon"
Time for negotiation now for Ukraine if they don't want more destruction of their country.
"It took 4 months for the allies, despite having 100,000 more troops, to push the Nazis out of Monte Cassino before reaching Rome. The MSM are attempting to push a narrative that benefits their need for ""breaking news"" Nobody can schedule a military action, ask Putin and his ""14"" days to take Ukraine."
if it's on the bbc - then it must be true ...
"No, it cannot :))"
"Ukraine and not doing okay in two months. The last nearly 5000 soldier come on guys, we need some peace. We need love listening and talk to many people die in"
The Russian occupied areas are no longer part of Ukraine. The owners of the land have decided against their longtime killer the Kyiv brutal regime. Only the west but the entire world understands this.
Lets just forget about the counter offensive the more we try to make it look good in Ukraine favor the more it looks bad on them
Of course. If they take 10 villages for 2 month it'll only take 8 years to reach Azov sea.
British media coping as usual
This will end 1 of 2 ways: Russia's victory or WWIII
Russian incompetency is a Force Multiplier.
"It does not look good for Ukraine's offensiv, If BBC reports in this fashion."
Lipstick on a pig.
Well Russia for the win again hahahahah
"I am sick off from my cousin sabih and i can not longer continue my nikkah with him as if his mom has interest in my mamu ,mama raju and she too is trying to show me neech beyond my imaginations with others and i do not like her and the friend of mine marvi is also supporting to them in order to get the belongings and he was like tu mai tumhari wajah se marvi ko or oron ko chordu...go to hell ..i do not care what he barks, sabih barked like dog and he does iy every now and then and i can not bear it and deibarately saying pagal to me how dare he and how he could drive me crazy and he i getting over my nerves and making me to get irritation when the father is no more and they gotten the shares so what those badd challans needed ?

Rather she is saying do bad tumko doodh ki kasam  - the mother feedings..and she gave wehams -the superstitions...
I can not bear them longer as if i had to sale my gold and had to do alot of domestic work so i  am like meri jan chutti aisay kamino se.."
Slava Russia
The fact that this war has been dragging for so long is an indication of how Russia has been weakened
Somebody told me the ukraine war is fake and is just a cover for something else. Did anyone else hear this ?
"Would be smart to use it to gain better Intel of Russian forces and stockpiles 

Then use the cold winter to starve and freeze the Russians out"
