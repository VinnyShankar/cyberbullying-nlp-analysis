"Pizzas are also round, Neil."
".    *If the Earth is flat, how do the space lasers that changed voting machine votes move in space?*"
Do people believe these lies?
Well this is BS.
You're a liar
You both right in all with one exception at the beginning: The large majority of 'flefs' never believe also in the concept of space or the OTHER planets and stars....for them the Earth itself is the entire Universe and stars are only some lights on the dome that supposedly covers the atmosphere but they aren't even stick to a complete and same opinion... :))))
you all luck like a government actors like Truman show all the commenters too
THANK YOU!people question everything and relay on evidence!
Flat Earthers are Flat Headers.
I often wonder is the rise in flat earthers due to mistrust? I don't believe it's just in the United States. People all over the globe seem to doubt things to be true.
Intelligent life will never let us fond them if this crap carries on. They're too busy laughing.
"With Social media and the internet, people can believe whatever they'd like to believe even more than was ever possible before....no matter how absurd the idea."
From what you are saying around 6 minutes into the video that you can observe a ship going over the horizon and you would lose sight of the ship beginning at the bottom and eventually the mast would disappear if that's the case visually without any aid our eyes are able to see at least double the distance from the left side to the right of what is in one's field of vision which would only mean that between the left side of your vision and the right side of your vision when viewing a ship going over said horizon there would have to be double the height of said ship at the point of the horizon from left to right in a field of view which would mean a person should be able to see the curvature standing on the beach please let me know if I am understanding you incorrectly and saying that you lose sight of the ship because of curvature I'm just trying to get answers for questions that nobody seems to be able to answer I honestly have no idea for certain what the shape is I know that I've been taught and that the consensus is that it is round and there's a small group of people that get called nut jobs for just trying to question the status quo I thought in science that in order to reach the correct answer you must rule out any question as to the accuracy of one's hypothesis or theory and takes a lot of proof in order to become a law of nature even gravity is still a theory because we can never reproduce it here on earth or in space for that matter
Of all the discoveries that Neil Tyson has illuminated for us I cannot believe that there are people in the US that think the Earth is flat. I guess I could say that my disbelief in their ignorance is equaled only by their belief of the Earth being flat.
Lmfao ah does Neil not know how geometry works Lmfao go ahead try and put a flat shadow on a ball or put a curved shadow from a ball onto another ball it does not work
who is the dumb guy on this video with no science qualifications....? why is he there? i don't get it. does DGT need a sidekick with a background in...nothing?
"flat earthers say it is a big lie...everytime i ask how or why, no answer"
"People who have bumped their head and now see in fractals. How does that ""translate"" Into our simulated reality???"
I wonder if it's possible to calculate the maximum rotation speed of a planet that might permit liquid water on the surface and hold an atmosphere that we could breathe. At what rotation would the planet fly apart? Would a fast spinning planet throw off its atmosphere?
"if the earth were a ball, it would always be day by day across the earth, by the curvature of light in the gradual density of the atmosphere!"
One thing he surely got right: school systems suck!
"Hi there Neilo, quick question. dont u realy think u cant see curvature at 35 000 feet? Having a discussion with a flat earther regarding your comment that you cant see the curvature at any height that planes go."
"it makes sense spherical objects are subject to basic gravitational pull but couldnt that be used to increase the size every time i listen to a ""professional"""
SO SADDDD!
"The Flat Earth Theory Was A Joke About The Flat Earth Map Being Used For Time Tracking,  There's No Way For It To Be A Day Later On The Eastern Hemisphere Than The Western Hemisphere Anymore...    Please do a follow-up to explain how mathematics don't compute...  this is going to be very important for international telecommunications and multiplayer gaming.   The best comparative is it being a few hours earlier in New Zealand than Los Angeles at the same point in time, instead of a day later in New Zealand.   
The Disc Earth Map Version Of Physics Was An Exaggerated Variant of The Flat Earth Map...  Which Is How People Saw Things In Medieval Times.
The only way to do this is count the days since year zero or another arbitrary point in time and adjust for orbit around the sun, calculating temperature, weather, and other environmental factors.    
Flat Earth Math Was Taught In Schools And Universities For Several Hundred Years And No One Noticed."
Only thing that's not specifically called out - although it is alluded to - is that the majority of flat earthers on the internet are pretending
Exactly and these people really run around believing anything
Why if it's flat do they suppose the Earth is a round flat pancake? It could be square or irregular...just sayin'
"Neil, it is cute that you think facts and logic works for flat earthers!"
"Even if it were flat, would it necessarily cast an arc shadow if properly oriented? It could be square when viewed from the top if there were four corners of the earth."
aha.... and at 3 min we give evidence how flat earth is true. its not just earth everything is flat
"It's more than the schools, Neil. We all know there's a tsunami of Dunning-Kruger effect happening in the land.

It's not exactly part of the cosmic sciences, but maybe it needs a video from you guys.

Btw, just looked up the statistics: about 35% of folks seriously think the Earth may not be a sphere. That's about 28% more than our worst nightmares.

Take care, people."
Neil is more lost than Biden !
Its funny you know all the bs you are saying is actually a big lie
some christians laughting at flat earthers in the comment section dont know that Bible tells as that earth indeed is flat
Simply tell flash earthers that they can date flat ladies only and you'll see lot of them changing their mind
The earth's shape actually most resembles a sea turtle shell.
Population sides with what's taught in a school but even nasa faked his video so much he displayed a digital model to prove it. Also flat earth doesn't rotate around yer model lol.
"The problem is, those intellectually challenged people... don't watch and don't want to watch Neil Degrasse..."
"As an expert to defend round earth, Neil should at least research the flat earth model. He describes the flat earth model completely wrong."
if it is a conspiracy are the millions of amateur and professional astronomersall over the world involved in this conspiracy? the millions of people looking through their telescopes and SEEING round planets and moons?
neil tyson the forrest gump of science...
"The fact that the moon appears upside down in Australia should be enough to tell flat earthers that its not upside down , you are standing upside down lookin at the moon from the bottom of the round earth looking at it  . And that dreaded gravity thing makes it all possible ."
"Greece not being in the tropics, the sun can never be ""directly overhead"" a well there."
"It is necessary to be able to lie as it does - Neil deGrasse Tyson. )))
No one has ever seen the earth with their own eyes a ball."
"The two in the video and those preporting globe in comment srction discount their own real common senses, in exchange for freemasonic deceptive delusions and insult ppl who don't buy into peer pressuring lies and ignorance. A number of ""flat earthers"" are controlled opposition anyway misrepresenting a level stationary realm exactly as firsthand experience relays always and the globe lie is built on disconnecting from one's own experience of reality"
My belly is flat...so I believe.
This dude is the dumbest smart person on the earth
"I love what you said.  I have been in the technological world for more than 60 years,  I got my first HAM Radio license back in 1958,  I have teaching credential and much more.  Let me tell you a few facts!!!  #1 the most powerful part of a magnet is the center (B) field, we live in a 100% magnetic universe, The great pyramids were teleportation devices as well as inter planetary communications.  Again you must understand the power of the center field it's what you and I are made of and the pyramids  were directly involved with the ""B"" field of earth, Thats what the ""ANKH"" was all about.  The pyramids typically show this exact thing , you will see a shaft with what looks like four tires on a shaft and typically a lady at the bottom clapping on one of the lower rings providing a vibration to same.   These were magnetic fields all the magnets were in the repel mode to maximize the ""B"" field energy , when they vibrated the bottom magnet it would resonate with all above and maximize the ""B"" field output of the shaft!!  ONE critical item you must stay away,  from any Iron metal.  There is so much to tell you about the ""B"" field from anti gravity to making granite rock soft like butter.  Think about it just for a second,  Most of us live in the earths ""B"" field.  So much more OMG.  I CAN PROVE ALL  THE ABOVE..  Take a look at coral castle Florida on YOUTUBE,"
"We never went to the moon !  64million a day goes into NASA to get laundered, I'm not saying the world is flat or round , just saying we never went to the moon . Do we really have video of the earth being  round ? Remember we have the fake news ."
"The Earth IS FLAT; it's resonant frequency is  7.83 Hz, which translates to a double B Flat. It's also Bi-polar. So, the earth is a crazy Jazz player."
"I love these 2 as a team!!!
I wish I was friends with SCI-MAN DAN so I could send him this! 
Tinfoil Tuesdays he always covers bizarre things stated, especially flat earth stuff"
"when he said ""Iiii believe!...."" my brain said ""I can fly!"" LMADO!"
@ 1:08 EXACTLY!!!!!!
"Just the terms MAGNETOSPHERE, ATMOSPHERE, IONOSPHERE.... 
Theres a COMMON thing in all those terms! SPHERE.... 
It's not MagnetoFLAT."
"Have to ask you, Neil. Surely humans had a lot this information way, way, way, way, way, way back in time. Ancient Ancient Ancient Africa etc... You never seem to mention this when you quote names, and Greeks,  and the not-so-old times (in terms of humanity on this Earth)... I like to believe they did, but Google does not go back far enough in time in their disclosures. Way, way, way, way back, like 20,000 years. Way back. Lost human history, though a lot is being discovered all the time. What do you think?"
Very true about the failed educational system ... it's shocking some of the stuff that should change that hasn't
We can simply see too far and every ilistration of Umbra and penumbra during a solar eclips share a singular common problem.
gold
imagine if we'd all learn to validate evidence and be a little more aware of our cognitive biases...
"C'mon, Dr. Tyson.  Don't you know that if the Earth were flat, cats would have pushed everything off the edges by now."
"Although I believe the earth is round, the video doesn't reflects flat earther's ideas. They don't agree the earth is moving round the sun, and they don't believe the moon is moving round the earth. Perhaps, they also don't believe the other planets exist."
Blow some bubbles in a glass of water. They flat? Dont know how its possible that some ppl out there belive its flat. Regards from the midages
"'The Flat Earth Society has many members around the globe'.

Says it all really!!!"
"how do you explain a 3point perspective art or photograph then in distance because in this perspective parallel Straight lines and angles 
no curves are used  in a 3 point perspective is a 3d drawing or photo with a dissipate point at horizon. so if no curves in this perspective which is a human perspective and how things are preserved. why are thier not curves in this picture or 3-point perspective...?"
"if there was an ice wall.. and the earth was flat..we would see the ice wall. or if the earth was a circular disc, the horizon would be curved anyway. ...square earth the horizon has angles.. theres no versoin of flat earth that makes sense."
"Hi guys and gals.  So I'm discussing this video and Neil's 3 wells experiment in this video 
with a friend who's fairly convinced that the Earth might not be exactly flat, 
but is definitely not round as we've been told.

Is there any possible way that:
              1) the shadows and angles that we can observe in a real world 3 wells 
                   (or perhaps poles instead) experiment could result from and be explained by 
                                  a) a flat Earth, 
                                  b) varying the size and/or distance of the sun, 
              2) we can 100% absolutely prove that our real world findings from this 3 well 
                   experiment absolutely must mean that the Earth is indeed round rather than flat?

I'm not sure that we can, because if we could then the whole flat Earth debate would have 
been settled by now."
The mere fact that you even have to make a video explaining this shows the sad state of todays society.
Video from space is hardly proof the Earth is round. . Prove the video isn't CGI.
Stop acknowledging them and giving them a platform Dr Frankenstein!
Lier lier head on fire
"apart from nells two reasonswhy he believes that some dimwits think the earth is flat. their is another. if you watch mark seargent you clearly see people like him just enjoy fans and likes and subscriptions and basking in unmerrited fame. i dont think they really believe the excrement they are promoting, but rather just the fact that they have their 15 minutes,,,,or more of fame. i mean he..y netflix made a documentary about it/him. in other words, anything that sells, will be promoted. yes neil, thats where lack of utilised education comes in. giving people like mark .s a platfrom to promote whats truly and evidently excremental. thank gosh for people like you neil de grasse tyson."
yeah there are planets but we dont live on one and all we have is these celebrities to tell us its so! im no scientist but im not blind and my pineal gland is decalcified....... every other civilisation before us knew we live under a watery dome with the sun and moon inside with us e.g. ying yang symbol.... undermine that please!?!
"Round, Flat, cylindrical,  what does it matter,  still got to wake up tomorrow go to work,  pay bills, taxes , family,  goals , plans. Stay the same."
"Neil, can you draw me a picture of how 8""x miles squared that looks like the ""Blue Marble ?
No, it would be impossible, right!

Let's see what the curve would look like!!!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-Xc94JpzTk&t=57s
This debunks the 8"" x miles squared from science for the earth's curve!!

We've been lied to!!!"
All the same people who believe the earth is round also believe that a man can become a woman by wearing a dress.  Just let that sink in for a moment.
Show me a flat bubble and I will consider a flat earth.
It takes all types of people to make the world go round
"this guy on the left is clearly being paid to say these things, and if he somehow isnt, i mean wow, how can you literally be 100% wrong about everything that comes out of your mouth. Im sorry you dumb ignorant freak who is poisoning peoples minds (guy on left) but space isnt real and the earth measures flat and it certainly isnt moving. You and your family are a disgrace to this country. ""spits"
"Which reminds me...  Have we proved that the universe is not Flat, yet?"
The only thing Neil deGrasse Tyson can demonstrate is that the mustaches went out of style 40 years ago
"Two experts tell us, where is thrue...hahahahahaha ..what for examples? OMG"
"People have such comfy lives (due to science) that they get bored, look for dumb answers and ignore all of that science"
"Didn't this guy run out and get the jab as soon as possible, LOL?"
Flat shadow ??????
Isn't it a bit sad that the country that put men on the Moon needs scientists justifying scientific facts?
It is beyond pathetic that anyone needs to discuss this.  What a total wast of time.  Makes you lose any faith in humanity you might have ever had.
"same ppl pushing vax, gender spectrum, spinning balls hurtling through star trek universe...go figure"
The earth is the foundations so it will never be moved
Do you have a real video of the earth from space no you do not
After listening to this idiot now I believe the Earth is flat even more
God you got to be the dumbest astrophysicists I have ever f****** listen to dude
Liar liar liar Neil Degrassi Tyson
When you send a ship to The horizon and it starts disappearing look at it to a high-powered telescope and you will still see it because the ocean and land is flat
I think Neil grassi Tyson is just saying what they want him to say. He would never admit it to us
A lunar eclipse can be explained with flat Earth model. The Sun and the Moon align themselves inside the permanent and they're both the same size what a coincidence
"If the earth was a round globe, the oceans would fall into the sky, gravity on earth is not that strong and water in the ocean moves freely like water in a fish tank. This proves the earth is flat and was built by aliens using space rocks and they stocked it with humans and animals, to study us and run experiments on us!"
nethertheless what shape the earth has its the dumbest video i have seen since a long time
"Niel is flat out lying! A ship does not drop over the horizon, get a decent camera and zoom into it, or even better something that has known GPS co-ordinates offshore (8""per mile squared is the curvature equation) it's perspective! how could Eratosthenes possibly know when the sun was directly over the second well when it was alegedly 800 kilometers away? Flat earthers don't believe the so called stars and planets are spheres. The rise of the truth about our realm is because technology has overtaken their lies. Flat Earth was the most searched topic on Google in 2017/18 until , under pressure from Congress, Google/Youtube changed the search algorithm and it's now a little harder to access the truth. I still wonder why the UN uses a Flat Earth map as its emblem?"
"I think that we have to just start saying to Flat Earthers, 
Prove to me that the Earth is Flat!
I say it is a Sphere, known since ancient times, now prove your theory that it is flat when all of the other planets are spheres!
They won't be able to do it."
I wish Chuckie Cheese would occasionally say something interesting or...funny. He slows down the entire conversation with his bs.
"Oh yeah, if anyone thinks that NASA has a ISS flying around our earth at 17 000/mph, that is 10x faster than a bullet shot from a gun people! 

Seriously society needs to step back, it hasn't even been 100 years since the first t.v. was invented and, Broadband didn't  start to replace dial-up until the early 2000's, with still only half of all Internet users having a broadband connection by 2007."
"You call that a demonstration, for who exactly?  If you're trying to show absurdity in something than you debunk the theories that made it believable to begin with, not reinforce your own beliefs theories!  

I shouldn't have a need to point this out, and the fact that people look up to that hack is testament to how people will swallow anything fed to them, so long as it's wrapped with a certificate or diploma.  For all that have a need to know; NASA is a Gov. agency!  Just like your failed education system.

NASA received $23 billion in 2021, while everyone was at home on lockdown .. Put that in your pipe & smoke it! .."
Belief despite evidence to the contrary is a CULT
"Is there ONE astrophysicist, one person with a PhD in physics that think the earth is flat? ...I think not."
Thanks for courage to face non-sense and wrong concept.

"These two have the best synergy of comedic intelligence on every topic they cover!! Of course Neil is insanely intelligent & Chuck's quick comedic wit is hilarious but Neil can be hilarious & Chuck is very smart too so together the two make the perfect pair especially for promoting science to the public!! 
...Unfortunately, when it comes to the sad & pathetically large part of the population that truly believe in CONSPIRACY THEORIES like the Earth is Flat and ideas like the so-called ""Q"" & scariest of all VOTED for & would again VOTE for TRUMP potentially risking destroying our nation...It really does make the topic of laughing at ridiculous conspiracy theories far less funny & a bit more terrifying!"
"Almost no flat earthers believe that model you show, with a flat earth in space along side ball planets. Almost all flat earthers have a model related to the flat earth, speculated in the bible. A flat earth, with a dome to protect it from space meaning we can't leave this planet, & this same flat earth, never rotates or moves & is the center of this model of a universe, where things orbit us. You don't seem to know how far off they really are. So much so that I have never seen that model you use, except by globe earthers (as they call us)"
According to The Bible there's nothing outside of the heavens a sub for heaven and waters above the fermentation if you believe this theory there's no way. You could believe in god
"Neil please, please take on some flat earthers in a videoed debate assuming that they'd have the guts to try and take you on!"
People believe the earth is flat because nobody trusts our institutions anymore.
"Flat earthers, generally, have never believed that the earth is flat on top of a void that we now call outer space.

Flat earthers have never believed that a ship would float out to the sea and just fall of the earth.  There has always been a belief of a wall to hold the water in place.

This guy isn't debunking anything, because he is strawmanning what flat earthers actually claim."
Flat earthers don't claim that the objects in the sky are round.  That is strawmanning.
yes but i have a question know where goes the shadow of the earth when the full moon is and we are in nightime
Well what goes around comes around. Were back to what ever you believe to be true is true by many!
"it is worth noting that at 2:56, the shadow of the earth should be getting smaller. not larger. the sun is tremendously larger than the earth."
where is the video you idiots.  false prophets. liars and preachers of false truths.
It's amazing how anyone can still believe this deceiver here. Bottom line he will never debate a FLAT EARTHER!
"It's more like a ""realm shape"".  - Angus Blackburn Jr."
"problem is that Neil is not addressing the flat earth arguments. that is terrible for debate because it is a requirement to at least understand the argument that the opponent is making. Neil is making a terrible strawman.

flat earthers believe that the sun is local not far away at all.

it would be much better for Neil to demonstrate at home how we can measure how far away the sun is. 

rather than just assume, begging the question, that the sun is very far away. 

neil won't convert flat earthers because the flat earthers have a very different argument than what neil is addressing. 

local sun vs distant sun. that is the real debate. not the shape of the earth. 

a distant sun proves earth is round, a local sun proves earth is flat."

"Katholik lyer, hahahah!"
"Flat-Earthers are truly fascinating examples of the diversity of human opinions. Despite overwhelming evidence that the Earth is a sphere, they persist in holding onto their belief in a flat planet. It's almost as if they are playing the role of ""God's Fools,"" demonstrating the extent to which our minds can diverge from accepted scientific knowledge.

The concept of ""God's Fools"" suggests that these individuals have a purpose in our world beyond simply being misinformed or misguided. Perhaps their role is to challenge our assumptions and make us question our own beliefs. By stubbornly clinging to their flat Earth beliefs, they serve as a constant reminder of the complexity of the human brain and its capacity to resist overwhelming evidence.

In a way, their persistence allows us to reflect on the nature of knowledge and the challenges of communicating scientific facts. It's intriguing how even with undeniable proof available, some individuals can maintain contrary opinions. This phenomenon highlights the intricacies of human cognition and the intricate ways in which our brains process and interpret information.

Despite the frustration they may elicit, Flat-Earthers serve as a reminder that diversity of thought exists in all aspects of life, including in the face of solid evidence. They compel us to remain curious and open-minded, continuously questioning and evaluating our own beliefs. In this sense, their presence can be seen as an opportunity for personal and collective growth, fostering a deeper understanding of the complexities of human perception and the power of our beliefs."

"*REALITY CHECK* 
A Reality Check for the adherents of the Flat Earth Cult. Apparently you haven't taken much notice of the Globe Maps that are seen in school class rooms and public libraries. Go take an honest look. Notice that, unlike the Polar Projection map you FE Cultists use, all the Continents and Oceans fit perfectly over the surface of a Globe Map. With NO GROTESQUE DISTORTIONS of the oceans and continents. Now go some place quite, and sit down for a while and relax. Perhaps even make yourself a nice cup of tea. You've just had a Reality Check, and the world has become a much more interesting and far larger place for you."
"*FLAT EARTH CULT*    The nonsensical idea cannot explain Day and Night. Sun Rise and Sun Set. The four Seasons in the Temperate Zones. The entirely different star patterns at a set time six months apart. Star patterns in far north or south latitudes are never seen in the opposite hemisphere. International Navigation and Cartography. But it's a Cultish belief system, so none of these axiomatic realities are of any concern to the adherents of the Cult."

So .....only americans are flat earthers..
"A flat earther dies and meets God he asks  God "" the earth is flat right? No.. says God its a globe like all the other planets""
Wow says flat earther this conspiracy goes deeper than i thought""."
"He's right, but having watched flat earth theories, I don't think he represents their view accurately.  Many flat earthers don't believe the planets and moon are spheres, they often say they are just lights.  They also don't think they go under and around the flat earth, rather stay above the flat surface.
Also, when he says flat earthers are a result of our country having a failed educational system, it's actually world wide, not this country alone that has failed."
The other planets are NOT spheres or planets.. so sad he gets away with this trash
Fake video?
I have a map of the world on my wall. It's flat!

"Did you ever see the cartoon B.C. ? Where B.C. says, I will prove that two parallel lines never meet.

Then he is seen walking closer as he comes into frame he has a long beard, Presumably he has walked around the world. He takes the stick out of the ground and there is just one line. Because the branch wore down. This was in my Euclidian Geometry text book in high school."
Neil forgot to mention PLUTO is also a round planet.
"I'm not a flat earther, but to be fair, your first moon shadow explanation is a combination of globe and flat. The flat earthers believe that the sun and moon are spinning around the top of the flat earth, in a dome. Never the less, how do they explain half moons etc."
Flat earthers really think that we'd get the same effect of a horizon on a flat surface its bonkers.

"Actually flat Earthers don't believe in planets - they think they are just fuzzy dancing angels in the sky - because that's what their Nikon camera - which can't focus properly on celestial objects - shows them.

Perfect dialogue for how God does not exist use your brain people
The firmament *is* indeed a sphere that encompasses the undoubtedly FLAT earth.
Question: Why does Hawaii have Interstate highways??
Nature favors the sphere .  Great argument .  Just brilliant .
I give the flat-earth community credit for thinking outside the box. Although they're not thinking very logically.
"About the street named Prinz Eugen exist pictures and movies made by visitors but CANNOT exist also about the end of the world (all around) pictures and movies made by visitors who support such a strong delusion.
&Because CANNOT be supported the theory about flat earth this is why CANNOT exist any talk, any debating about people TRYING to visit the end of the world(all around) to take pictures and movies for us to support their theory about flat earth. 
And all these practically demonstrated facts make clearly the flat earth theory is nothing else but only a clever twisted delusion."
"When discussing flat-Earthers, we usually default to discussions of physics and astrophysics to debunk their theories (understandably). I'd like to hear a discussion of the psychology behind their ideology."
Does anyone really care if the Earth is round or flat and will the difference make oil and gas cheaper?
It's not just a poor education system that produces flat earthers but unscrupulous people that know the earth is round but sell the idea of a flat earth to gullible poeple for financial gain.
"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions is a book about the history of science by philosopher Thomas S. Kuhn. Its publication was a landmark event in the history, philosophy, and sociology of science. Kuhn challenged the then prevailing view of progress in science in which scientific progress was viewed as ""development-by-accumulation"" of accepted facts and theories. Kuhn argued for an episodic model in which periods of conceptual continuity where there is cumulative progress, which Kuhn referred to as periods of ""normal science"", were interrupted by periods of revolutionary science. The discovery of ""anomalies"" during revolutions in science leads to new paradigms. New paradigms then ask new questions of old data, move beyond the mere ""puzzle-solving""[1] of the previous paradigm, change the rules of the game and the ""map"" directing new research."
Neil thinks you are dumb
The earth is pear shaped.
"On our spinning globe, standing stationary on the equator gives you a moving speed 24'ish thousand miles per day or a tad under 1000 m.p.h. which gravity stops you flying off the globe by centrefugal or more correctly 'Centrapetal force"" but its the same effect that grounds you at that speed which any point on thd equator is moving at. Standing on the North or South Pole give you no speed as you rotate on the exact spot at zero m.p.h. with 1 rotation per day & gravity is 1G wherever you stand on the esrth, it's no more than 1G on the equator than it is on the poles  ...so how on earth do you weigh the same on the equator as you would on the North / South Pole?   Because of the rotatational velocity of the globe, we should get progressively lighter as we move from equator to south Pole. You, Neil cannot & will not nor would not answer this parodox ...anyone else like to have a go & tell me why we weigh the same no matter at what latitude we stand on? Bring it on!"
"No, what is truly odd is the fact that every single picture of a whole earth taken from satellite & shown by NASA from the late 1950's till now, shows an entirely different shape of continent's shape, the Bay of Mexico is twice as wide in some than in others when the globe pictures of the same size are shown, why?  & how often do you need to renew your actors liscence Neil?"

"My flat earth friend send me a video of Tyson saying that tou cant see the curve of the earth from the hight when a guy jumped from space, but videos shows the earths curve sci man dan showed it in his video, and my friend used that as proof that Niel de grass is lying LOL"
Niel is a Professional Liar and you guys fall for the sorcery and magic everytime.
"3.11: 
Ofcourse we haven't seen a flat shadow since WE DON'T LIVE IN THE EDGE!!!!!"
Eratosthenes put this to bed two thousand years ago.
"Show the real earth spinning, because there isn't any proof , he's nothing but B's / liar people ,and there is proof that earth doesn't spin  people ...EARTH IS FLAT IT SURE ISN'T ROUND LIKE A SPHERE..."
What I have always realized that the disappearance of objects over the horizon  can only be due to the earth being spherical. Even as a child I knew this. I think earthers of today also know this but they are looking for (and hoping for) a moment in the sun (pun intended) for some fame and notoriety they would not otherwise have.
"If earth would be flat, with the lunar ecplise, it would be day on the habitated side, or night and you would see nothing. And how long will this period last? So there is only this solution: a spherical /round earth (geoid)!"
Those arguments are nonsense on a Flat Earth. But it shows how people really don't think by theirselves because all it takes is some guy to say something and they will believe it because it's mainstream.
I think you are missing the reason why there has been a surge in the belief that the earth is flat.  It is a rebellion against the very nature of science.  These people are actively and willingly rejecting the right of anyone to tell them what they should believe!!  They want their worldview unchallenged by evidence!
Something wrong from this video is the shadow thing about the moon. The moon doesn't orbit the flat earth in the way shown in the video.
the earth is flat.  don't take my word for it.  find out for yourself.
The Lizards told us to stay on this planet
"I could also demonstrate the Youtube algorithm pushing every anti flat earther theory in the first searches. Makes it even more suspicious, when people get censored about things that don't matter much, because let's be honest, all these trips in space just wasted money. What did it bring, really...? Nothing, zero, useless."
"I don't believe the earth is flat, however, Neil never addressed flat earth theory. Seems deceptive."
No scientist is more entertaining! I could listen to Neil 24/7 !
Earth O
It's a simple fact; the Earth is spherical.
"The moon is a focused electromagnetic phenomenon, 
called plasma. Cosmic electromagnetic energy comes 
below from the flat and stationary plane, going above. 
The inner reflection of this electromagnetic energy on 
this field's ceiling, turns it back down, creating a focus 
spot point in a semi aetherial environment. 
At this spot, there is fluorescence of the aether because
of the focused cosmic electromagnetic energy. 
The spot that is created is the moon.
(4th state of matter as specified publicly by the american
astrophysical professor Among R Foster in 1965)
In this way, the Moon reveals to us the large part of the 
terrestrial and oceanic surface and with these natural 
characteristics serves as a natural map of Earth..

"Welp, problem is their conception on how a flat earth projection works is completely false. It's a flat plane inside of a spherical dome... so it is the same as the planets we see in space... also their shadow in multiple wells study is also not correct... the sun is smaller and moves in a circle around the flat earth, along with the moon... the shadow changes in the well due to the sun moving away from the well.... so far none of their examples on why the earth is not flat is wrong.... I see this is why Neil will not debate Eric Dubay...."
The fact that a video even has to be made for this subject in the 21st century is just sad...
"Don't worry, boys ""Greeks had the angles"""

"LOL LOL LOL, what a pathological LIAR with 4th grade stupor rationale'."
"Hello all great video, I am a Christian but I absolutely love science it is incredible how vast and neverending it is!! Lastly the earth is a Sphere!!"
"so then, what you actually say, when you say the Earth is flat, is that the Earth is actually a Petri dish, and those within the dish are experiments! LOL!!
I'm sorry but your explanation of a round Earth is far too deep for any flat Earther."
"I'm curious:  What do the flat earthers say is on the ""bottom"" of the disk earth?"
"recently a flight from los angeles to indonesia had to make an emergency landing as a woman was giving birth. But if you look at the fake map of the rotating wet planet, you will see that between LA and Indonesia, there are the islands of Hawaii and some others and they all have airports, however the emergency landing was made in ALASKA, and if you look at the map of flat land, oh yes, alaska is right in the middle of the path in a straight line between these two places. The truth cannot be hidden, theory is crushed by the reality of facts.

And there are still people who believe that there is a ship on Mars, and the trip takes 80 years, and the first rocket was invented in the mid-60s, totaling just 60 years.

Unfortunately it is easier to repeat the lie than to pay attention to a few details."
"This observation is doubtlessly here dozens, if not hundreds of times. Still: If the Earth were flat, the cats would have knocked everything off that they could, long since.

"Your both are such Muppets. Flat earth construct has been around for thousands of years depicted in every civilization known to man. Civilizations that today we still are in awe and mystified by. Every civilization. Deceive yourself and your community all you want, karma is no bs. God bless and best wishes"
"If the earth is flat, we can solver global warming by tipping the earth over to the cold side"
"Would putting flat earthers on a space ship and having them observe an entire trip around the Earth help, or do they already have theories about how that could be faked too? What if they got into a space suit and could fly around the Earth, go down and touch it to make sure it's real? Would that be enough yet? It's absolutely insane to me that people are still struggling with a concept that even ancient civilizations picked up on. Allowing people to reach this level of ignorance and form movements around such obvious falsehoods is extremely dangerous to us all and should be taken seriously."
No flat earther has ever found the edge of the earth. This is because first they'd have to leave mom's basement.  First steps!!!
"Please don't shut down flat earthers, they have been a fantastic source of entertainment for the past few years! we all need a good laugh once in a while :)"
"Flatties have no real contributions to science. Just hang out on YouTube telling how smart they are using the Technology that REAL scientists made.
Flerfs are lying to preserve their source of income from the Mentally ill and poorly educated."
Neil works for the government  just like Carl Sagan did.
This is a flat earth thought burner. For sure.
"all scientist need to stop with the smugness when you're speaking with flat earthers and just explain to them how to speak with you. science is its own language and they dont understand you.
dear flat earthers, you will never convince a scientist unless you speak their language. this is the scientific method and also why you should say thank you when a scientist says"" flat earth theory"". in science, there is no status higher than theory. hypothesis, law then theory. 
Step 1: Make observations.
Step 2: Formulate a hypothesis. (you are here)
Step 3: Test the hypothesis through experimentation.
Step 4: Accept or modify the hypothesis.
Step 5: Develop into a law and/or a theory. (your scientific audience want you to take them here)"
Neil you suck as a human being
"Mr. Tyson has mastered the art of explaining on a level anyone with open ears and an open mind can understand. All the information and evidence is available, the earth is a sphere, plain and simple."
Sorry your IQ can't be that big of you believe in flat earth period ask a flat earther to predict the next eclipse using flat earth math

"I though Geordie La Forge was there. Seriously, when you're in a beach and the sun is going down, lie on the floor and look to see if the sun has just disappeared. I mean Just. Now stand up... look, you can still see the sun... a little. If earth is flat, this won't happen. Huh  Flat Earthers... Numpties"
Greeks didn't create all the knowledge he keeps mentioning..... its well known knowledge now.....also....columbus....no1 thinks he's the great explorer they pretended
"The main reason I am positive that the Earth is round, is that if it truly is flat, and there is an edge, it would be the single most exploited tourist destination in the world. There is no way the most entrepreneurial flat Earth believer would not be charging top dollar to line his pockets to tour people to the edge of the earth."
"Would both sides of this dispute meet me halfway, would both parties consider the possibility? of a Hole half the size of Antarctica, under Antarctica :)"

"The egyptians had the same test as the greeks, except with obelisks."
why do galaxies have all its stars spiralling horizontally and not all over their black holes (assuming each galaxy has a black hole in them)?
My question is why do things get smaller before they disappear and not get cut in half? I can still see the whole ship until its far enough away that its the size of a dot. But on a curved plane wouldnt it slowly lower into the ocean in our eyes? And we would only be seeing the upper half of the ship?
"AS an FE, this explanation is pseudoscience, total BS!!!!... if you observe the sun plenty, you'd see instances when the rays ain't parallel... the ship disappearing on the curve is optical illusion... But you guys never research, you only mock us non stop... Anyway, stay alive, it's all but love in this camp."
Most flat earthers that I've seen only think it's flat just because they don't trust the government or NASA. But like what advantage would you get from that anyway?

"In reality, the earth isn't round but slightly egg shaped. Obviously, this came about when god/Jesus placed his hands on each pole and squashed it. The proof of this is that all Eskimos are very short and look like pizzas."
This is for you Joey
"I think the only reason they say it's flat is because they know good and well that it's round, and they don't trust anyone that doesn't ""go against the grain.""
They have simply started believing  everything is opposite of what it is, then, they make up all of their ""facts"" after the fact 
I say this because why in the heck is everything in the universe round, and the earth has to be flat?"
Circle is the easiest object to form in nature
Does somebody have a Link to the video from space of the rotating earth?
"Tyson is so ignorant when he talks about things outside of his wheelhouse.

NOBODY in the day of Columbus thought the earth was flat. In fact the spherical nature of the earth and its likely dimensions had already been calculated - Columbus was the outlier because he disregarded the science and thought the earth was about 20%-30% smaller than had been postulated, hence the reason he thought he'd made it to India.

The flat earth movement didn't come about until about the 1840s and was popularised by a man called Samuel Rowbotham.

No, the people who went before us were not all primitive, barely-evolved human-animals. They were intelligent and sophisticated people who understood far more of the world than a lot of ignoramuses of the present era seem to realise.

Tyson should stick to physics."
The North Star alone debunks Flat Earth. Just that alone.
Take all flat earthers to space and leave them
"One should never misunderestimate the flat earthers.  They have representatives all around the globe, and they realize they have nothing to fear but sphere itself."
"Not Flat and controlled by a ""God"".
Not Spherical and flying through space either.

False Dilemma.
There is Always a Third Option."
Never listen to a man who's selling a book.
"Flat Earthers: I've never seen the core, so it's only a theory!
Also Flat Earthers: The Ether is real!"
"My theory is that ""Flat Earthers"" don't really believe the things they say, I figure they're just world class level Internet Trolls.......it's no coincidence that the growth of the flat earth beliefs directly parallels the rise of the internet."
Of course the Earth is flat locally but globally it's round. A sphere is the most efficient shape. How would a flat earth shape come into being? Nature always take the path of least energy so why make a flat earth? Such an inefficient shape.
"Neil is missing the real reason for the ""rise"" of flat earthers. People are trolling. They're internet trolls Neil! C'mon man, 99.9% of flat earthers are just trolling. They're picking a concept that's so absurd that its actually funny (earth being flat) and pretending its true to get views, likes, retweets, and just to f#$% with people."
Globetards will be globetarding.

"Trying to argue globe earth with a flat earth believer is an exercise in the old saying of ""never try to fight a battle of wits with an unarmed person"".

There is not one proof that earth is round sry hahahahahahaha

Unfortunately, the money men took over."

"Mark stone says we don't need astronauts to prove the globe? Are you illiterate? Are you insane? You only believe in a globe measurement because some dummy uses sticks to show a lie? You can't prove anything unless you know for sure it is round. The same idiots tell us the earth is billions of years old by looking at a rock. . First of all you had to know the make up of that rock at the time it was created. It's called theory, guess work, creative thinking at best. You just don't believe because some guy in a white suit says so."
Only ignorant people can believe earth is flat... Hinduism also told us 10000 years ago earth is not flat

Sometimes I think Tyson has to keep reminding himself the Earth is round.

The patterns are not the same as if you were to draw the route on a flat surface. Just try it out, you can see the planes on the site and flying over your head if there is one."
Forrest Gump didn't address this issue.
Man all of these arguments are strawman fallacies. No one thinks that the earth is a flat disc floating in space with a bunch of spherical bodies around a spherical sun.
Columbus knew the Earth was round. That's why he went to the west expecting to encounter India. What they didnt know is the there was an entire continent in the midle.
Space is fake

Look at the night sky closely. 6 Months later when on the opposite side of the Sun looking opposite way why are all the stars exactly the same? Are we really on a ball spinning and shooting through empty space or have we been deceived by God haters who are working with the Demons to take your families souls. Use your mind. Stop listening to the fake science and the lies of the times. Jesus is real and He Created all things. Have faith in Him and not faith that nothing created everything.
Demons do exist. They pose as aliens and will deceive those who ignore the warnings God gave us in the Bible. Proverbs 1:7 Fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge. Don't listen to those demons who rule our world with deception. They will have your children and destroy you if you do not understand who they are.

Of course the Earth is spherical. But this lie about the rotation has got to come to an end. If the Earth was rotating we all would fly off into space. The other lies about the Sun and the Moon. It is obvious they rotate around the earth that is why it is called sunrise and moonrise and sunset and moon set. Obviously the sun is closer to the Earth than the moon that's why it is brighter. The truth will set you free stop lying to people.
Yes it's flat cos vision makes it see as round.. And this round thing is made up of many flats joined together..... One more reason... The cosmos for this earth is one... So we are on a flat surface symbolically.

"Flat earth girls are easy though, sort of like hippies in the early 1970s."
kennedy was shot by the CIA. US government is run by lizard people. Trump is still the US president. Neil Tyson is time traveler from the 33rd century and with the anarchist movement. earth was flat 4000 years ago and is still flat today. pictures you see from space is photo shopped . trust me its safe to stick a fork in the electrical outlet.
"Like I told my nef-in-law, "" Show me a picture of the edge or shut the F up!!"""
"Worst are the (following) people who take the words from other, instead of testing it and see their own experience. THE Earth is FLATE. Be ware who you trust and follow. Have common senses by detoxing our bodies from the toxic food that is blocking our senses, from better decisions making and from reaching our true potential. 
Good luck to us all and visit the youtube channel that is about to be eliminated, channel: eric dubay"
5:20 why wouldnt a flat earth model work with a third well added?
"Well, since they often believe space is fake, the shape of other planets is probably part of the NASA conspiracy.  [Sigh]."
"thank you dr. tyson. without watching this, i was on the fence about the earth being flat."
"Dear friends!
All words have got meanings.
It's called sea LEVEL
for a reason!!!
Did you ever hear or see a sea BEND? :-))))).
Look and read carefully Alexander Gleason's map.
it's only 100 years old."
"My argument against flat earthers: Time Zones

If the Earth is flat, how is it that the sun rises and sets at different times all over the planet?
How can it be daytime in North America and nighttime in Asia if the planet is perfectly flat?
Either the entire surface of the Earth is facing the sun or it isn't."
People in Columbuses days didn't believe in a flat earth...
"the ground isn't even flat. nothing is perfect. And yet somehow, simultaneously, everything is perfect."
"Not sure what to say, flat earthers are funny people."
neil is the greatest man ever.. this host proves that!
Circular is not necessarily a sphere
"Flat Earthers (FE'ers) always run from these two points and they are very easy to argue to them without vast science knowledge.

1) Cant see Cali from Japan. Mist and vapor is a FE'ers go to argument with this and its so easy to disprove because when you look in the telescope you dont see a hazy or foggy white you see blue skies.

2) You can fly between the two without ever seeing land. No FE'er has even adressed this. Wonder why?"
"Flat earthers, qanon and trump supporters all share the same mentality."
"With a flat Earth would there even be eclipses? I mean with the sun facing the pancake of Earth in order for a shadow to be cast upon the moon it would be ""behind"" the Earth to begin with and nobody would be able to even see it...right?"
"'Failed educational system'...not trying to be political, but, just pointing out that: schools in America are LARGELY 'liberal'...justsaying..."
You know those demonstrations of a gravitational plane with a rubber sheet and a steel ball? Imagine that in every possible direction around the ball and that is how gravity looks/works.
"I see a lot of these videos, but why does Tyson even bother. It is like beating up on a 5 year old. The flat Earth theory is not even worth the effort.

Tyson should concentrate on the real problems in physics. Oh wait, for Tyson there are no problems in physics. It is all perfect and Tyson is the high priest."
We can barely fly a suitcase from point a to point b.  If. You are so smart get a job with an airline.
The fact that it's 2022 and they still don't have a model proves the earth isn't flat
"No matter what is said about the Earth being round, those idiots who think it's flat will come up with a counter statement from thin air to try and prove the Earth is flat. The only way that you will truly get these flat Earthers to believe it's round is to send them to space to see for themselves. And give them a window seat. Of course, they may also say ""Oh that's fake. That's a screen not a windows and that is a fake Earth"" or something like that. That's how their minds work. But, the best way I think to convince them would be for them to see for themselves. So, I say send up the Flat Earth leadership so they can see and then report back that they were wrong."
10-4 on the failed education system! Seems like they don't teach critical thinking any more... or even just plain thinking!!!!
"Everybody knows that lunar eclipses are when they're changing the light bulb in the fake moon. 

Duh."
People believing the earth is flat is like black people believing only white people ever owned slaves.
"I love this scientific analysis of the flat earth, but it's never going to convince someone who believes in it. they don't believe in gravity, they often don't think that space exists (they think that the planets, sun, and moon are ""lights""), they think science is a conspiracy by globe companies to control the masses."
No serious person thinks the Earth is flat. This is a straw man fallacy created by pseudo intellectuals to make themselves appear smarter by comparing to an imagined ignorant person. Neil is a mediocre Cosmologist who couldnt find work in that field so he milks his skin color celebrity by dancing for dumb people and calling it science.
Shadows.
"8 inches per mile squares is the curve of the earth. No one can argue that fact. So at 100 miles across land or water MUST have over a mile of curve.  Over an entire mile of curve.  Period.  Now, go tell that to people in Florida or Kansas or Nebreska.  They will laugh at you.  As they should.   Check out on utube ""200 proofs the earth is not a spinning ball"", by Eric Dubay who BTW Neil will not debate.  Fact."
I would love to survey flat earth ears to see what schools they went to.
"The earth is not a sphere, it is oblong. With the poles stretching farther than the middle"
"The animated diagrams are excellent and effective. ""A picture is worth a thousand words,"" a moving-picture coupled with audio, even more than that.

@5:49:
Oh my God! They're falling off of the edge of the Earth! THEY'RE FALLING OFF THE EDGE OF THE EARTH! :O Hm, welp, never gonna see them no more, except in the afterlife. **snif snif**"
"Technically if you are a biblical flat earther fueled by what's in the Bible people who believe that would say that the other planets are not planets and are stars. Also, the moon and sun rotate above the earth according to them. They also want to argue that you can pull the view of the ship no matter how far it goes. Their argument about walking East is them saying well there's an ice wall I will hit eventually and the government will stop me. By the way, I am NOT a flat earther, but I work with one and have these conversations regularly lol."
A Failed Educational system is Exactly why this country is so f'd up. Just a bunch of entitled ignorant flawed thinking people running around.
Everyone of that clowns explanations can be easily debunked.
"He said it right in the beginning, that physics defines why the earth and other planets are round.  The physics that define how our entire existence behaves don't work I'd the earth was flat.

For a fat earth to exist, the entire structure of our basis for mathematics, geometry, and physics would have to be completely different.

This is the biggest part that boggles me about the premise of flat earth.  That for it to exist and our pear shaped oblate spheroid to be a hoax, the entire understanding of our mathematics would have to be faked."
Columbus was out there just causing problems left and right.
"Rounder earthers become flat earthers but it never happens in reverse. hmm, wonder why?"
"The fact that this has to even be said is crazy. We've known the Earth to be a sphere for 2,000 years. 
But no better person to explain it than Neil! It is because of Neil and Carl Sagan that I love to learn about the Universe!"
"I'm just 2 minutes in so maybe they'll get to it but wasnt it generally accepted that the earth was round far before 1500s? I mean, the Greeks and Persians actually made a pretty good calculation using shadows in a water well right?"
People need to think - is he saying anything that proves his point or is he saying things that are meant to make you feel dumb if you question him?  Why wouldn't he just say proofs?
"Earth is flat because i like to think that is flat, because you become angry. So the more flat the earth is, the more angry you became, the more happy i become. Beeing a flatearth believer its a winwin for me"
"Why do liberals, atheists , Hollywood, Corrupt politicians, corrupt scientists, NASA ,liberal college universities and satanists hate the concept of flat earth ? It's like they fear people would believe and destroy their Anti God Christ movement ..... Hmmmmm"
Science. We need to focus a lot more on science in our schools. I am so tired of explaining simple scientific principles to adults.  Sometimes I wonder is religion  killing common logic skills in people
The problem with the Flat Earth worldview is that their worldview is very... flat! Badabum.
Great video Neil. Thank you for making it simple. Good point about the failure of the educational system. Too much emphasis on the social issues like woke and CRT.
It's frightening that there's people who actually believe the earth is flat.
"Let me tell what they won't, people you ever wondered why every thing is a circle, not crazy shaped, these people have beautiful words but it's not the truth, out planet is had been cracked in half it's not a circle it's not flat it's jagged in kind of like an oval. Ask me how I know."
Dont be decived by this liar.
"consider being more careful with the phrasing of ""people need to learn how to think."" That phrase is very, very frightening to many and tend to drive them to these fringe groups."
I think the flat earth people who spread such nonsense and trying to brainwash people they should be changed or have mental health treatment.
"This is why I keep trying to tell people ""You are missing the point of Flat Earth."" Yes, sure, there are people who fully believe the Flat Earth thing, but when you put their movement under any kind of scrutiny it becomes really obvious really fast that the Flat Earth conspiracy is about radicalising credulous people into far more dangerous ideologies, typically tied in close to extreme far right rhetoric. 
It STARTS with ""The Earth is Flat and it's being hidden from you"", progresses into ""Because of the Jews who control the government"", and ends at ""Which is why the Nazis were correct."" And if you're wondering ""Why would they pick such an overtly ridiculous starting point"", think about the first reaction that you JUST had reading my comment breaking down what these people believe. 
Saying that the Flat Earth movement is essentially just a dogwhistle for Far Right Wing extremism sounds completely insane, and that is exactly why so many of these movements have an overtly ridiculous premise that hides the darker stuff that they're actually trying to convince people of. 

Basically there is very little point in bothering to tell them the science, because the vast majority of them don't care about that. Just ask them to elaborate further on *why* there is a conspiracy to say the world is round, and they will eventually just tell you exactly what their beliefs are."
Flat Earthers is when kids get a free pass during grade school and then suddenly declare themselves geniuses ten years later after discovering how to use the internet.
3:54 Aryabhatta knew it too.
Trust the science ! You are all perfect subjects ! Congrats
Why is the sun in this diagram Yello?  Isn't the sun white?
Theres more provable proof we live on a flat and stationary plane than a spinning round ball. You're all brainwashed from birth to believe actors like this fool.
"it's sad, that in the face of overwhelming evidence throughout time, that we *still* have people who believe idiotic ideas."
"I still don't beleive there is such thing as a ""flat-Earther"". Maybe some remote tribal people could think Earth is flat, but otherwise, not. The fE's know that Earth is spherical. Its a soap box to stand on...to set themselves aside from, or above the rest of us, intellectually."
Tyson talks a lot of shxt
Mr Tyson does a great job educating people. Keep up the good work.
So if we are flying through space at whatever mph so all the stars and the moon are spinning at the same rate in the Sam direction?
"Flat Earth?    Let's see now, when so many people would ""wave off"" a ship/boat/whathaveyou from the docks and it would sail (back then) towards the horizon and ........................ [time passed] ........ lo and behold, they returned to the same docks without sailing off the earth.   Ergo, *Round Earth.*"
"NOOOOOPE! earth is flat. No argument. It's flat. Galaxy is flat. Stars are flat. The sun is flat. 
Plates are flat. Yo-yos are flat.
String is flat.
NOOOOOPE! it's all flat.
No tests needed. It's all flat.
FLAAAT!!!!! a lunar eclipse is flat."
"This video doesn't really answer to anything that the flat earthers I've seen on the internet seem to claim. They think the other planets are a hoax and some of them say that the Moon actually emits it's own light so that doesn't explain the shadow thing. They also say space is somehow fake and everything is just a part of this ""firmament"" that has a dome over it. Don't ask me what that dome is made of or how it's there. Nobody has answered my questions about it either."
"There is not one real picture of the earth from space. And the picture of the moon and earth 1 million miles away are animated very poorly. The speed of the moon in relationship of the earth spinning is completely wrong. The earth would be 360 spin as to the moon traveling 13 degrees. There should be millions of pictures and videos! All we have is low orbit photos and videos and they all show a horizon at eye level. A normal plane at 37,000 feet will have the horizon 280 miles away and if the earth is a globe there would be a 34,000 feet drop in the horizon. A significant change that would force you to look down to see the horizon. But the horizon remains the same at eye level. 
This is a scientific fact that proves beyond doubt that the earth is level and cosmology is far different. We have been lied to by paid propagandists. 
NASA showed a earth rise from the moon. impossible! The moon spins 360 degrees every 27 days that provides to only show one side of the moon. Called Tidal Lock, IMPOSSIBLE when the earth is wobbling and forces from the earth sun and planets.
I don't know what we live on but it is level proven by scientific fact  and something feels it nessasary to lie to us. I believe our souls are in danger. Wake up Truth, Knowledge and Love will provide our freedom."
"Nahhh I still don't believe them,"
The flat earthers don't actually believe the earth is flat it's just a way for them to say i think this way and I'm going to think this way no matter what you or anyone else says
"This would be so much more educational if they would get rid of the ""the other dude"""
What you have is CGI. nothing more. An intelligent person would not mock and ridicule. They get paid to lie. I'm not getting paid to spread truth. have some critical thought.
"I mean if there was a basis of rational thought in it there wouldn't be a problem.
For example like there's no problem with believing in ghosts as long as you do so with thought and rationality.
As a matter of fact when thinking far enough rationally, most would end up in favor of the existence of what we call ""supernatural"" because like Tony Stark says: ""it's science we don't understand yet."" And it would actually be irrational to deny it's possiblity/existence because of lack of understanding.
But for an example like this even when I am being as open minded as possible the only way to rationally defend a flat earth is to deny human observation and logic as a credible source *which I can do* but to what extend?
Because then what are you left with?"
"What about that experiment that happened in the 16th or 17th century in the canal, and the noat didn't disappear from voew"
"The downside to today's connectivity is that no matter how preposterous or idiotic someone's idea may be. There will always be someone out there that drinks from their fish tank and believes it provides the body with necessary algea and vitamins. Then these people people are provided with a sense of brilliance, like they are on to something because other people do it too."
Flat earthers are just a group of comedians playing a grand joke on all of us.
"NDT, debate Dubay."
"Rather disingenuous talk about flat earth. From what I've seen from the flat earthers is, Some think the earth is flat like a table. The sky is a dome attached to that table. And there is nothing else outside of that. As if we live in a sort of ""snow globe"". The universe (as we see it) is just little lights on the inside of the dome that somehow rotates around this flat earth. But not behind the table, because there's nothing under the table?
I don't think I've heard any of the flat earthers say, ""We agree the rest of the universe is spherical and expanding. But only our earth is flat.""
Perhaps they think our universe is just a giant snow globe on God's fireplace mantle?"
"the simple proof is when astronauts put water on space, it becomes instantly round."
Any with a western education that thinks the Earth is flat should be sterilized.
"If  the earth was round all the water would fall off it into space, DUH!!"
Bigot Christian and Bigot Islamists have to understand that science exposed their religion a century ago. Try to defend as much as you want to but you can't lie to anyone now.
You're mentally incompetent Neil.
"The proliferation of deliberate and calculated misinformation is starting to have quite a deleterious effect on the human population.
Flat Earthers, Anti-vaxers, US Election deniers are all cut from the same cloth - wilful ignorance.
Someone suggested to me recently that the vitamin/supplement companies had a hand in this by using pseudo science to argue against doctors and classic medicine in the 70's and 80's. This grew several generations who had a deep distrust of science and the mis-information creators leverage that and feed it aggressively. I am inclined to agree with this.
Perhaps someone wants to look into the correlation and see if this checks out. Because it is getting worse, much worse."
Neil Tyson is an idiot fraud
the human condition
"""The accounting of energy"" - never had I hear a more nerdy phrase that sounds so cool! Simply love this man!"
Also flat earthers think that the earth was round (as they imagine it as a circular disk). They only deny that it's a globe.
"Am I  rolling in laughter then at the same time thinking what on earth are we doing in this day and age trying to explain to (some) people that  our world is round. It's like saying that our ""flat earth ""is the center of the universe.  Like Neil said it's a free society we live in  and anyone is entitled to their beliefs.  P.S. the Easter bunny as a living entity does not exist as there have never been any photos or encounters  of such a being on record,  makes bigfoot and the lochness monster more believable."
"Physics dictates that the Earth is round.
The Flat Earth Society recently proclaimed that they had members all over the globe."
Everything they talk about here also happened in The Islamic empire during the Islamic golden.
"Why flat-earthers are hard to convince.
For some reason, they already believe the Earth is flat. They come up with ""experiments"" they think are clever to try to prove their point. But the flaw is: Their tests and ""experiments"" are designed to support their existing theory - not actually TEST it or challenge it. 

On the bright side - That's also why so many of their tests are hilarious to watch."
is there any star talk w/o the other guy!!!!!!!!!
"On July 9th, I did an experiment to test Flat Earth Theory. Before sunrise, I hiked to the top of Mt Whitney,  which is the highest point in the Lower 48 states, with a compass. If Flat Earth Theory is correct, one should be able to see both Polaris ( the North star ) and the Southern Cross. I had no problem finding Polaris, but even with the help of a compass ( so I could face South ) I was unable to see the Southern Cross. 
To quote two men from a show that was popular 10 years ago: The myth IS BUSTED."
Earth's atmosphere how does it exists next to a (vast)vacuum of space without a form of a physical barrier?
"I've been dying to get to the bottom of The Pythagorean Theorem.  If it is true, the Earth MUST be flat, otherwise a^2 + b^ = b^2.  What am I missing?"
"I think the rise in the number of flat earthers is largely due to people wanting to feel smart but being too lazy to work for those smarts, and go against experts who describe these phenomenons in relatively odd ways. If explaining how earth is a sphere needs examples like wells and rays of light, then they are equally happy with a flat earther coming and saying their version with seemingly similar examples. Include the opportunity to claim that there is a conspiracy and there you have it: flat earthers.

So, it's less about people being less educated, but more about people wanting to feel smart through some strange conspiracy."
"Flat earthers seems to actually believe that there is a REAL debate about the shape of the earth. 
They don't seem to understand that flat earthers are just entertainment for smarter people."
Flat Earthers are either attentions seeking conts or just really mentally ill
"Gosh darn Americans that are so self focused, they lose sight of literally an entire world around them with different time-zones, cultures, climates, bio-diversity and people"
"Shame,that some people don't have common sense..the earth Has to be round"
"Because revolving of they all is illogical ultimately. If when you consider that each one of them in order is steady, all of them except The World becomes illogical."
"I agree with you 100%. Now, to be fair, I kind of like the philosophy of ""why do you think it's true? Because there's evidence or because a teacher told you so?"", which is the premise of the flat earthers, and I really think that THIS is good to be sure that you're not manipulated by a government that, for example, would teach that the president is god or whatever. Now, of course, flat earthers fail to recognize the SO MANY evidences that earth is round, and that spoils the first philosophy, but still, it reminds us to keep a critical mind, in my opinion."
"The World is steady and is on the center. While The Sun revolves around them and pull them to itself, creates an attraction power and circulation. Thus The Sun provides to keep together them."
"Yeah! There's a block surrounded The World, which is made of iced, I suppose. I don't wanna mention those what don't appear yet."
"In my opinion, The World is like semi sphere, like a cone. And while The Sun is steady, others planets revolve around theirselves. Due to not fly away The World because of this planets, The World keeps also steady via The Moon. As long as it turns around The World, The World saves its constance. Therefore it doesn't fly away, this is gravity. And The Moon only arises on the south side. The World is inclined towards the north. Because The Moon goes to the spike point of cone and comes back. Thus it provides attraction power for The Earth. And The World is on the center. The Sun is on a corner. That's all!"

"What gets me flat earthers openly say all other planets are round. Yet the same proof ie, photos that are taken of this are taken by the same organisation nasa, which takes photos of earth. Yet they believe all other planers are round just not earth. Doesn't make sense"
"He does so little to understand their ""arguments"" so he is accomplishing nothing."
Educational systems don't fail by luck. Capitalism needs idiots to be able to harvest.
Nerds
Tyson attacked a strawman model of flat earth.
@astronogeek lol
Believing in a flat earth makes your brain flat too
"Can someone more knowledgeable then me explain this?
https://youtu.be/G1BCY_r1w4I"
"Well, they'd actually say keep looking out, as there is no up with respect to the globe earth and the cosmos.

I think that flat earthers all around the globe would say that you're just sphere mongering."
"Atmosfear, stratosfear, exosfear, mesosfear, troposfear, thermosfear."
You're description of the Earth  It's so despicable you call yourself a science yes but you're nothing but a shield is but a shield factor
This man is a national treasure.
I suspect many of the people that claim to believe in a flat earth are only doing it to get attention.
can someone send me a REAL video of the REAL round earth spinning really fast? Please do not send me to the 1972 photo or the ones after 2015. A REAL VIDEO. I'll wait
Boat dissappearing over horizon is false. All you need is a telescope and u can see that boat again. Can't believe they are using this old false example.
I do wish we would turn the camers and take more pictures of Earth (non-composite).
"There is no evidence whatsoever to confirm that the Earth is SPHERICAL. On the other side, there is plenty of evidence that it is NOT. All those quasi ""proofs"" such as the Moon eclipse or the south starry sky or those pictures allegedly taken from Space are just CLAIMS, because EVERY THING could have been (and actually WAS) fabricated in a studio. What there is REAL EVIDENCE for is the fact that the Earth is NOT FLAT, but that it is BULGED or CURVED. Now, THAT has been verified for a long time, but not that the Earth is SPHERICAL. All those ""proofs"" stated by Science support only the notion that the Earth is BULGED. All of that ""evidence"" work for ANY POSSIBLE SHAPE apart from FLAT. The same ""proofs"" that have been stated to support the idea of a SPHERICAL Earth can apply on a SEMI-SPHERICAL, QUARTER-SPHERICAL, EIGHTH-SPHERICAL or SIXTEENTH-SPHERICAL Earth. All those proofs only confirm the notion that the Earth is NOT FLAT but BULGED or CURVED, and that's all.

Besides, I'd like to ask the GLOBE-BELIEVERS (Neil de Grass of course included), if they REALLY believe that the Earth is ROUND. That has been claimed in oh-so-many videos that I've watched so far, where GLOBE-BELIEVERS would state over and over that the Earth was ROUND. And that's why I'm asking you now, do you REALLY BELIEVE THAT THE EARTH IS ROUND?

You don't have to try to change my mind, since I already believe that it is ROUND, so just please answer that question with a YES or a NO, that will suffice.

The reason for my asking that question is because I'm doing an experiment in which only GLOBE-EARTH-BELIEVERS should partake. As soon as I finish it, I'll tell you why I asked that question and why I call them GLOBE-BELIEVERS.

So, once again: DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THE EARTH IS ROUND?

Thanks for answering that simple question. ;)"
"flat earthers should be sent to live on the space station to see it rotate with their own eyes.
ps: everything without movement appears flat from a distance"
No real photos.. all make beleive just like the ball earth...
Flat earthers and people who die on hills trying to convince others 3^2 = 6 are a interesting type
"i man said recently. ""i dont know if its level or spherical"" but i can say one thing for sure  "" ITS F**KED"""
hello Neil im 12 years old and I started reading your book which awaken in me my passion for astrophysics I need to say I've learned more in books from you and Stephen hawking than I learned during 6 years in school so yeah our school system is failed
Why does he always touch people in interviews?
I need my belly to start rotating very fast
We live in a country where a lot of people smoke Marijuana.

This was only true for dumb people in the west. People in Asia always knew that the earth was round.
I am pretty sure that the Earth is rectangle in 3D shape. Thoughts?
Now I just watched a video of a flat earth's who said they convinced you the earth is flat were you just amusing him or your decided not to argue with a fool and come down to his level(?) of alleged intelligence
Where is the video of earth rotating?I would like to know.
Watch Eric Dubay for refutations to these ideas. Nasa photoshops every single image they release.
"flat earth society has new members all around the world.

flat earthers are just running around in circles.

hold on, i got one more

why did the flat earther cross the road?  
well, there was gonna be ten, but they couldn't find a flat globe.  so, only one could made it, and so you only got one flat earther crossing the road."
So I have a question (and no I am not a flat earther) I have always been confused about the concept of up and down for Astronauts. On earthe we have up and then we have down due to gravity. That's very simple to comprehend. But in space where there is no gravity what is an astronauts perspective when they look out the wondow? are they looking up at the earth or down or lateral?...hmmm.
https://youtu.be/fQoz9aiNRzU
Biggest problem in flat earth community is that they are not unified. There isnt a single or few well specified solar system mechanics. You cant argue with them because you can't know anything about their beliefs without specifically asking everything to every flat earth believer before discussing with them.
Fascinating. Helps me understand why I believe what I believe.
"The globe believers have to deny their senses and accept what the government tells them.  Real photography from over 100,000' shows a flat plane but the globe believers choose to believe the fisheye lens photography, photoshop and CGI images. No one has ever felt motion and every experiment to prove it has only proven it is stationary just like the Bible says. Most globe believers don't accept the Bible and have chosen to believe the science from the secret societies like the theories of evolution, gravity, heliocentrism and the big bang. What most globe believers fail to understand is that secret societies are Satanist at least at the upper levels. 
    Satan is the god of this world and he has been deceiving the whole world just like the Bible says. If anyone can show verified data from an independent source that contradicts anything I said please share it."
"Flat earthers are like Trump supporters. No matter what evidence is provided to the contrary, they'll still believe what they want to believe"
If the Earth is a sphere how come an aeroPLANE is not called an aerosphere? Boom! Proof that Earh is a plane!
"if only it was that easy, you underestimate the power of religious indoctrination. the ones i have encountered have a bad excuse or out right denial of the science and the scientist. . they dont believe we have gone to the moon, photos from space are a hoax. even when shown a ship going over the horizon , excuse, its the heat coming off the water , making it look that way. i say they have a mental illness. to deny whats right in front of you ? i dont know what else to call it? short of launching them into space , how do you fix this?"
"If the earth was flat, cats would push everything off the edge of it."

Put 3 bottles on a table in a row. Point a flashlight to the middle 1 from the top. There wont be light in the outer 2 bottles. Not a flaty here but we need better arguments.

"The Gospel for the New Testament Church is 1 Cor. 15: 1-4 KJV. Rom. 10: 1-21 KJV and Rom. 3: 25 KJV explains it further. 
It's what Christ did for us that we're saved and it's by faith alone, not works. We're forgiven for all sins by Christ's shed blood."
"The man responsible for this is a known con artist who has started other ""movements"" to sell merchandise. It's really that simple. Then you have the 90% who ""believe it"" as a meme to troll the other 10% who thinks it is real and the 100% who know better but know if they know better. People who claim we only know it's shape from space travel and ""disprovable"" sailing claims, then just graph it's shape using radio tower signals, or earthquake P-waves. pfft."
Sheeps believing in crapy graphics......show the video of the rotating earth instead.
i love all the totally natural and definitely subtle cuts that happen mid thought throughout the video. u can clearly see how his thoughts flow.
its obvious we have a failed education system just look at republicans
Just love neil!
Explain these 2 things an I'd believe you if it's not flat earth y boats an planes don't travel that in curves an only across 2 why does east west nort an south don't go around in a circle

The earth can't be flat.  Cats would have pushed everything off the edge by now...!
"Einstein proved it to be sheer stupidity long before it even became a thing that's how moronic and these people aren't grounded to reality at all you can tell that they just simply believe it because ""God"" or something else tells them to and they don't question it, they don't even try to find proof of Gods existence or the existence of flat Earth, it's also impossible because neither God nor a flat Earth exists so... An absolute absurdity and the next biggest absurdity after the flat Earth theory is religion"
Love Neil
3. People are getting dumber.
Earth is not flat
"I did all of that.  I hit subscribe.  I did everything correctly... again.   Now They want me to do it again.  
the 3rd time.  I was a member.  Somehow, now I'm not a member, not even on into the future.  WTF.  Over?"
"Neil, the earth is seventy percent water and none of it is carbonated. The world is flat!"
Moon is flat it's just facing earth always on its side
Video can be manipulated
ok but have you ever tried standing on a beach ball? doesnt work cuz its round. it only makes sense that the earth isn't round then or we wouldnt be able to stand straight
"BREAKING  NEWS

Tragedy strikes at the Flat Earth's 18th annual surfing championship

Upwards of 40 competitors perished yesterday, whilst taking part in this years annual surfing competition.  A rogue wave of massive proportions swept them over the Flat Earth's Ice Wall. Never in the history of this event has there ever been a wave of this magnitude. All hope of recovering the bodies however is impossible. Sadly, the current reigning champion, Gustav Flatoski is among them. He will be sorely missed. His record of 8 straight wins will be hard to beat. Stay tuned for more news as it comes to hand..."
earth is flat.....period.....your all gonna be soooo surprised & feel foolish...
Sometimes I imagine what if a group of Flatearthers were taken to the moon n back. And vlog it. I would want to see how they would react upon seeing the round earth from the moon.
Flat earthers are people who thought like any kid but never grew out of it
Neil and Chuck for 2024
it is flat
"The flat earth conspiracy is the single biggest example of the saying:

Genius has its limits, but stupidity knows no bounds."
I don't believe that majority of people in Columbus days thought the earth was flat. Scientist just want a example to dispute. You did make a good point about astronomers say all planets are round but some say it's egg shaped ooooooh could one be shape as a astroid
"Its actually crazy to think that rellative to where you are right now, below you is sky, upside down people, buildings, oceans and planes! The globe sure is amazing."
This proves nothing
It's not that the earth is flat but more like the dimension is.
"Funny how NASA's OFFICIAL photos of the globe earth from space are so different.  Sometimes North America is a small postage stamp and others it is 2/3 of the surface of the image. There are like 8 Official images of earth from space and even if you presume that ONE is absolutely real, it means all of the others are FRAUDS.  Keep in mind. They are ALL DIFFERENT.  That means NASA lied and lied and lied  and lied when they released all of the other photos. 

Also official globe earth photos have obvious PHOTO SHOP STAMPED cloud formations. The same unique formation stamped over and over and over again all over the place.  Neil Tyson is a likeable guy but to just claim they have video from space and to just accept it.. When the same agency lied to us putting out all of those other fake images is too much to ask. There is a saying. ""fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me""  but in NASA's case it is ""FOOL ME 7 TIMES AND JUST TRUST WHAT NEIL TYSON SAYS SHAME ON ME"""
"Neil just casually dropping Greek knowledge that geometry is 'earth measurment' 
guess these flat earthers are good for something, I just learned some Trivia!"
"I have a theory, what if we see all these planets they look round fair enough but I don't. I only see 2 round things when I look up... but how many planets hold life like earth??or are as unique as earth. And if am honest the sun ain't a planet and either is the moon. What shape is a light bulb?"
"5:16 i'm having problems understanding how a third well would debunk a local sun on a flat earth. i'm not a flat earther, just not getting why they suddenly wouldn't be able to explain the 3 shadows, but 2 are alright. seems to me like the shadows work just like on a spherical earth. can anyone enlighten me?"
After the getting the real picture of Earth some religious cult believes that Earth is Flat.
Neil looks like a wholesome uncle
So assume the sun is 90 million miles away and then calculate the shape of the earth lmaoo what a non scientific experiment
The horizon is measurably level and globular THEORY states the curve can be seen from the ground. Hmmm funny how we have a level horizon but globe theory claims the curve can be seen from ground level lmaoooo.
Cringe paid actor
"Looking at Jupiter, wether looking through a telescope, or at a Hubble image, you can plainly see that Jupiter is bulging a little bit at the equator. This is because that planet is spinning so fast, with a 10 hour day. The Earth spinning slower, and having a solid surface rather than being a gas giant, does still bulge at the equator, but it's not nearly as pronounced as with Jupiter."
charlatan scammers
puppet of the zionists
"As a young child, I lived on a small island in the pacific. So one could see ships or sailboats, canoes, appear and disappear over the horizon as they approached or departed. So even as a 3 year old I knew it was round. So the first time I heard about flat earth thing, I just laughed and knew they were crazy. Also I would go on boats and ships and could see islands appear and disappear on the horizon. Nothing more to say."
"Well, they don't believe the planets are real either. lmao"
"The US elected an illiterate, ignorant president when the former guy was elected, they're just too afraid to admit it & accept it."
"Yet people in the US are advocating an education system that fails us under the banner of freedom & patriotism. The very idea of getting rid of the department of education to give ""parents"" more control over their kids education is a farce perpetuated by oligarchs & right wing fascists to keep those who don't know better illiterate, ill informed, unprepared & incapable of upward mobility."
The aluminum ball.
But people proved they can make a perfect circle and ball by free hand to dictate the universe is it unravels. And so here I am
"But Neil, I thought you said the Earth's shape was more like an oblong pear shape..?"
"The point is that flat earthers belive other planets are fake, and the sun is a light coming from some spot on the sky."
Where is the video?
"Just take a prominent flat earther to space so they can see it for themselves, already. Broadcast it live and ask them what they're looking at."
We have Video?   These people NEVER stop their Lies.
this is such a good explanation i think flat-earthers would actually believe it
I'm not trying get the flat earth police involved here but each of these examples have other explanations that supports the plane model.
what ever happened to the debate with eric dubay? That would be fun. cheers
There is nothing you can say or do that will change a flat earthers mind
The Earth is flat.
"0:27 bro finally someone recognizes this logic, everything is round and spherical and boom out of nowhere a disc planet"
My first math teacher killed my life as a scientist. He only wanted to flog the sums into my head.
He explains things amazingly. I wished he was my physic teacher in school.
When they got off the chairs I died laughing!
"I think the point he makes at 7:00 is very important. Information literacy is essential to navigating the information age. Look at the entire generation born before 70's and all the off-the-rails conspiracy theories like Q anon, pizzagate, flat earth, etc that has dominated the majority of them. And the worst part is you can't even explain information literacy to them because it's such a foreign concept that they think it's some psyop to control what info they consume (ironically enough) instead of the antidote to that. I mean how do you convince someone whose basis of reality is not only wrong but the very way they observe it as well? Someone who doesn't even know how to find info and/or distinguish it from misinfo? You can't. 
 Critical thinking and information literacy needs to be the foundation of all educations and the last decade has proven why."
Where you at Flatters?
earth is a pizza

"In my experience, the rise of homeschooling has contributed to this educational system failure.  The homeschoolers in my life, people I love, chose to filter out scientifically proven facts and instead read books to their children that espouse unproven notions that align with their beliefs."
You can't say everything in the universe is round because we don't know everything that's in the universe. The flat earth is madness for sure.
Flat earthers have nothing to fear but sphere itself.
Look at all the pretty sheep in the comments you brainwashed idiots
"All you have to know is that Uranus, aka your anis,  is round."
"To all of you who believe the Earth is flat:
Please, for the love of God, do us a favour and walk off the edge."
When I was younger there was a three year period when I believed the earth was flat...then I turned four.
Gonna be a whole lot of long faces when the ball earth deceivers are exposed. In the meantime theres so much evidence in favor of FE all one has to do is look at it as opposed to listening to this clown and cohorts like Bill Nye who reads from a script rather than think critically.
https://youtu.be/eslgiZhs0js
"Neil, you personally said "" Earth isn't a perfect sphere and more like a potato"".  
I'm not a flat-earther but discrepancies in information keeps the conspiracy theory going and there are tons of discrepancies.  
I suppose the discrepancies are due to the transition from the technical science to layman's terms however they are discrepancies nonetheless."
"Schools teach want to think, not how to think."
Somebody you trust said the earth is a sphere.....no need to investigate. Just trust.
Are you telling me that the Earth isn't a disc placed on top of four elephants?

The Solar system model in the beginning is completely in accurate and that is not what flat Earthers believe
"Dr Neil is correct:

1) free speech :  good
2) failed education system : bad

We live on an oblate spheroid, orbiting the Sun, roughly 92,000,000 miles away.

Failed education system is this guy talking! The more he reads the more he talks about what he read!!!
I can't wait till you all find out the turth.... You all are gonna gonna go crazy cray all day.....
Some of these FEr's also claim the planets don't exist. I've heard that the Phoenicians came- up with the idea of FE as a psyop to persuade competing seafarers not to adventure to Far so they wouldn't venture into lands the Phoenicians had already found.
"The earth is a stationary leveled plane, deal with it."
What was the thirs place that Erathosthenes used? Wikipedia and this book I have here both say that he only used two places.
It's the fact that no one does their due diligence to find the correct answer.  It's cool in the younger generations to be ignorant.
The earth cannot be flat. If it was cats would have pushed everything off the edge by now. This isn't complicated people.
Your mom's an elephant which poops cures cancer!
Your mom's a sphere!
Your mom is flat!
Neil the grass fed bison.
"I know a lot of time is spent on the technical details, but what stands out to me when I listen to flat earthers is their distrust of authority.  Especially of government.  And you've got to admit governments are not the best at telling the truth, or at least the whole truth.  That seems to me to override any logical conclusions they might otherwise make because they can always just question the source.  So really the easily provable facts here are not the really the issue.  It's really trust, like any conspiracy theory mentality."
The absurdity is that you never see a flat earther becoming a globe believer...just food for thoughts.
He makes it sound like the flat earth is  flying through space. I didnt think thats what flat earthers thpught.
"Flat earthers believe there is no outer space and there is a dome around the earth.  Here's a question for flat earthers, how can a lunar eclipse happen? Does the flat earth turn side ways to block the moon then return to the flat position? Wouldn't we all fall off if the earth did that since their is no gravity? Just asking lol"
A coin is round and it is a plane the T is just a add on to bamboozle
Christians jailed Galileo for life for saying the Earth revolves around Sun.
Where's the video he mentioned at the beginning?
Technically it's more of an ovoid
bahahahaha fisheye lens top secret family clearance you neil are lying!!
The most biased conversation ever
When the poorly educated truly believe their level of education is the summit... you get those who believe the earth is flat.
"Thank you, I'm done arguing with flat earthers."
These 2 make a good talking show.
"video starts with ""Is the Earth flat Neil?"" .... snarky look at camera .... ""We have CGI video that artists at NASA created..."""
Brainwashed if you believe NASA
"6:40 its 3 things, last one is that the internet has given a platform for everyone to speak and have an opinion, even to the dumb ones."
The key round earth comment was about our failed educational process.
U will realise in next 5 to 10 years that earth is flat save my comment and tell me after that. And universe is that much big we cant think even human being may know less than 0.1%  about it
He is so intelligent
No we don't live in a country of free speech
All shadows are flat
I've never seen this footage.
"Heaps ain't flat. Habakkuk 3:15 Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses, through the heap of great waters.
Psalms 33:7 He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up the depth in storehouses."
Sure bud
Of course the earth is flat its obvious!!!! And human beings created the universe!!! Dont believe all this science nonsence!!!!!!
"As noted in a Facebook meme (the source of ALL accurate knowledge, of course...) if the earth was flat, cats would have knocked everything off by now..."
I cant believe the brightest scientist has to explain about this cos the flat earther is let loose.. damn..
"""without that kind of training, you'd run around and believe anything"". Yep. That's exactly where we are today where people think they know more than doctors"
Flat earthers don't believe that the earth is flat. All they do is provoking a discussion to give themselves some importance. Surprisingly they don't care that they make fools of themselves. All this is not less ridiculous than claiming the earth is hollow and there are reptiloides living underneath us ...
"Flat Earth doesn't make sense.
If the Earth is flat how could it be hollow?"
"The truth is that flat-earthers like conspiracy theorists, and bible thumpers only want to know just enough to confirm their beliefs. Truth or reason doesn't even come into the equation. These people want the emotional high of attention and feeling they are secretly superior than actual finding answers. We need to fund schools better and pay teachers more. We need to make higher learning affordable for everyone. If this doesn't change it will be hard to get solutions for 21st century problems from people who believe a man could survive 3 days in the belly of a whale."

"The only thing that really just calls out the insanity of the theory is the fact we literally have footage from so high up that you can see the curvature of the Earth. If it was flat, you should be able to see everything if you go up high enough right. Sightlines. Jeez just trying to understand how people think the world's flat is so jarring it has to be a bit or a joke. Like cosplayers that get too into their role."
I for one believe in a flat earth and the Biden administration
"Nice video.  New ways to look at the flat earthers lock on truth.  I always ask for a photo of the bottom.  ""Do the roots ever grow out?"" asks me."
Nature does not make flat things everything is rounded
"Absurdity,and dummy about round earth,what you are protecting is a lie about round earth,you`re in with the deception you fake just like  round earth."
The earth is flat. Space time is curved.

"But if earth isn't flat, then why are maps of earth flat? Wouldn't all the landmasses near the top and bottom be super distorted?"
This video demonstrates the absurdity of entertaining fools
"On the rise of flat earthers; it's not *just* the failure of our education system, though that certainly plays its role. It's the recent dishonesty of so very many institutions losing the trust of the people as well. From once reputable news outlets, both print and broadcast, to Institutes of higher learning to once reliable government agencies; all have been caught time and time again in blatant, even frivolous lies and the people have come to distrust them. It is as much these unconscionable failings as any in the education system that gives rise to insane conspiracy theories that were once thought laughable by the general public."
"I was I high school physics class. And asked my teacher. Why in all the pictures of space, the earth was lit, but blackness surrounding. He explained that light either emanates from a source, or reflects off matter. And that blackness was...NOTHING. I guess I knew the answer already. But my mind was blown. Because how do you conceptualize the concept of nothing. Anyway I guess kids don't have deep thoughts these days. Or ask these types of questions. They rather walk into traffic while staring at a cell phone."
"Is the earth flat?

No

Thanks , goodbye"
Derp! 4yrs later. Snake in the grass Tyson is in hiding. The central planners are engaged in a full reset. EARTH IS STILL FLAT.
Flerfologist  Thinks Neil Tyson is the antichrist...lmao..
"...but, couldn't they argue that the moon is flat! they can only see one side."
Dont believe him! The earth ia in fact.. a cube. Cuboid earth theory is much better and supported by many voices in my head!
"earth isn't round, it's spherical."
"So how many flat earther's have received Darwin awards, compared to normal people?"
'On being wrong'
I love how all the hilariously witty globe comments are filled with flat earthers ruining the globe with actual science.
"The only thing I find absurd here is the title of your video, you didn't disprove anything nor demonstrate how a circular plane has been disproven, as a matter of fact you lend credence to the possibility,  Tyson admits it before going on to  use the current solar model to ridicule the fact."
"We don't need a physicist to tell us that, that is the whole point of ""Flat Earth""
To illustrate a ridiculous concept that no sane person could ever believe, hence delegitimising any of the real conspiracies.
Besides everyone knows the Earth is hollow."
Funny because I saw Thor fighting Hulk on TV too
Real Earths have curves
I think both things are true. The 1st amendment AND a poor education system...
"06:00 when you have The telescope you can see The boat, and when it dissappears get bigger telescope and you see The boat again"
Who will I feel superior to after you get rid of flat earthers
Tyson always gets this wrong. People don't believe in moronic conspiracies because of a bad educational system. They believe this crap because makes them feel special. They tell people this constantly.
Just out of curiousity why can't a flat earth model not explain the angle of all three wells though? Can someone explain this. I suck at math lol
"Why do intelegent informed people continue to entertain rediculous discussions put forth by unintelligent ignorant people. This just lends credibility to otherwise ludicrous ideas.
I think the smart ones get a thrill out of trolling the dummies. The dummies get offended and double down to get revenge. An excellent example of a self perpetuating situation."
ERIC DEBAY KNOWS BEST
That anyone believes that the world is flat defies belief.
"But see, this all assumes we ever went to space.  And you can't prove we ever did.  Because all the pictures and videos are fake, created to make you believe that we did.  Why?  Because it's worth billions and it's all a part of the New World Order - the N.W.0.  That's right, Hulk Hogan.  He controls it all.  You 'Rounders' drank too much of the Kool-Aide."
I'm an artist and I know how light cast on a sphere. It should have a brighter spot at the closest point to the light and fade out. I would love to hear am explanation that makes sense
With microgravity an astronaut can let liquid out of it's container and it immediately forms a sphere.
Google states  a 6 foot person can see around 3 mikes before the Curvature of the earth  causes the horizon.  If that's true why can you see oil platforms 27 miles off shore using a Canon 900 or 1000 series? And why can you see 1000 miles and further with true infrared?
NDT on Felix Baumgartner space jump: You can't see the Earths Curvature from 30 miles up. Also NDT : you can see the Earth Curvature from a few miles when a ship disappears on your horizon.
"Neal says: All the Suns rays are parallel. 
Google: Crepuscular rays
Think..."
I think Neil is just done with humanity
Have they done Doctor Who yet? And how he does his... time wimey stuff..
"I know. The Earth lost weight like I did. I was round, now I am flat."
Do we really
shoe me the publish date of the video YouTube!
"You mean hollow spheres right? Gravity is generated at the surface of the earth i.e. the earths crust those inside the earth would necessarily fall to the surface. Those inside the earth would have no idea that they were inside there will be a ball of plasma in the center that illuminate the inside as above so below.  The earth is a hollow bubble of water and we are living on the layer of clay separating the waters. The Phoenicians are the ones who spread the rumor that the earth was flat so people had to hug the coast while they dominated the shipping lanes,"
I don't know why Neil is so popular.   He argues with idiotic misrepresentations of flat earth theory.   They don't think Earth is a disk in a row of spherical planets like he's disputing.   Not in the slightest. They don't think the lunar eclipse is the shadow of the Earth.   Why spend 5 minutes describing shadow shapes to his friend that is playing even dumber than he is?   The flat earthers have a decent explanation for the well shadow experiment...  the sun is very close to the Earth so it's rays aren't parallel as that experiment assumes.   His graphic on the screen shows the flat earth explanation working fine while he's saying it doesn't.  So lazy.   I don't think flat earthers have any valid insights to the universe but arguing agains straw men is a waste of time.   At least argue with that they actually believe.   I don't even think he's taken the time to find out.   He just spouts 3rd grade science facts in a condescending tone as if that's going to convince anyone.  A good pop-science spokesman like Carl Sagan would actually find out what they believe and prove it wrong not just ridicule them in the same childish tone that they ridicule him.
The center of gravity on Earth is not the center of the planet but everywhere on the surface which is why water doesn't run off.
speaking as an extra terrestrial flat earthers can f'off!!!
"I'm really starting to like this guy. Took me awhile, but he's growing on me."
"I like how Neil at the end says ""keep looking up"" which is years before the movie ""don't look up"" was made."
Some people find sport in being contrarian.
Dr neil degrasse tyson Earth water transported to another earth-size planet that requires water? do you think that this is a possibility?
Would Neil explain how water sticks to a globe?
Bendy water globetards eh
People go by their gut and emotions only can not be convinced they are wrong.
"Disgrace Tyson and NASA, All you deceivers have is CGI, Fish eye lens, Green Screens, Photoshop and Actornauts. We are not moving faster than a speeding bullet, lol. Water does not stick to a ball, lol. Nixon did not talk to Neil Armstrong on the moon on a landline phone, lol."
science is beautiful

Untill you experience the big flip when sailing in the ocean it's my favorite part.
"You you set a flat earther's head on fire, it burns a nice warm copper oxide green.   Could it be from toxins in their brain?"
"I'd love to know what you think of global warming? A strange fact is that the proponents hardly ever wish to debate all the aspects and data concerning ""Global Warming"". I would agree with climate change however but I have yet to see any actual proof that humans have caused ""Global Warming"". In more recent times I have also noticed that the figures quoted about ocean temperatures rising are absent from current arguments, does this mean the figures have not been realised  and the oceans temperature has not increased as predicted? I also remember the prediction that all the glaciers would disappear by the year 2020, which of course hasn't happened! Flat earth and global warming seem to be con man generated ideas , with the most of earths population being deceived by the latter however and governments making a mint out of Carbon Dioxide taxation. One of the points Global Alarmists often seem to emphasize is that Carbon Dioxide is a greenhouse gas however they seem to ignore photosynthesis as plants use the Carbon to grow and separate the Oxygen which is released into the atmosphere. Would more carbon Dioxide in the atmosphere not promote plant growth making the Earth greener? I have a theory as to the possible causes for a certain amount of climate change and a possible explanation for the ""Big Bang"" but both would require more time and Space (lol) than we have here.......     Flat Earth theory is how to fool those who don't actually use their brains and apply the knowledge which is freely available - hopefully my comment will provoke discussion...."
"Youtube puts a disclaimer under the video, directing us to Wikipedia to prove Earth is not a disc.  Chuckle."
I loved Astrophysics for People in a Hurry!!!
"A cube casts a circular shadow an a sphere every time. Get a book, a ball and a light to prove this for yourself."
What's crazy is that you try to convince flat earthers the earth is round. Anybody that believes that Earth is flat MUST have a mental problem!
Neil said it himself. Watch this video again. He says the well test WILL work if the Earth is flat and the sun is much closer. He says it. That exactly what flat earthers are saying. I'm so glad all of these fakes are being recorded and that video will stay on the internet FOREVER. We need proof that's these humans are so closed minded that they could not imagine any other answers but the ones they were told. Collect video evidence of everyone that doesn't believe. They will go down in history as fool who can't think for themselves and just follow the flow.
"Tyson did not really say anything that would move any flat Earther. They think the Sun and the Moon are two spotlights magically hovering above the Earth and they explain a ship's disappearance below the horizon through ""perspective"". ANYTHING you say either has an answer or, if it cannot be answered anymore, is labeled propaganda and outright denied."
The intro was brilliant!!!
To free somebody of stupidy an act of liberation is required .theres no  point trying to convince them trough verbal explanation .thats pretty much why they are stil around imprisoned by stupidy .the paradox of an inmovable object .simply no point they wil not budge .
Vaxxed people for me are the new flat earthers
1:56 he sounds like a rdr2 npc lmao thats amazing
Please show the raw footage of the spherical spinning earth so flat earthers will shut up. Why would anyone want the earth to be flat when it only brings ridicule (from people who can't prove the opposite)?
"I've never thought of this until just now because of course the earth is round. But to advocate for the smooth brain people out there. What if, the earth is flat, but it's spinning so fast that it appears round? A US quarter is flat, but if put on an axis and spun around it appears as a sphere."
"I liked NDT until he said ""processeez""....."
What ever ! Once you know you know
"As far as flat earthers are concerned, an idiot is a genius to another idiot"
"One argument for a spherical (curved) earth I haven't heard much.  Build a large building, some combination of very wide and/or very tall (several hundred meters wide, hundred of more meters tall). Carefully make the walls truly vertical,, with plumb lines, etc.  Measure the distance between the walls at floor level, then measure the distance at roof level.  The separation will be greater the higher the second measurement.  I don't recall anything in any flat-earth theory that explains why vertical lines, perpendicular to the surface of the earth would not be parallel.  This is well known in architectural/engineering/construction fields and must be accounted for when these projects are designed and built."
There's no proof the earth is a globe. Yet there's more proof the earth is a flat realm
LOL. There is no empirical data supporting the globe nor rotation. Neil is a fraud. Not a single serious experiment showing curvature nor movement. It is a scientism for ignorants and indoctrinated. The known laws of physics tell you it is wrong.
I'm not a flat earther but I'm pretty sure flat earthers believe earth is the center of everything. So it doesn't matter if everything is else round.
"0:06 
His eyes lol"
"6:48 NDT you're supposed to be smarter than that.  

The fact that THIS ONE TOPIC in particular can be discussed does not mean that we have blanket Free Speech in America.

There are plenty of ideas that are quite taboo and platforms like yootoob have no problem violating your basic human rights if they dont like what someone has to say."
"My wife had a guy trying to get her to believe that birds don't exist, they're government drones that land on lines to recharge and keep an eye on everyone."
"If the Earth is flat then can i still say to my friends, ""Come round anytime"" ?"
but you just said that the earth is a pear shape
I don't understand why flat earthers believe there is conspiracy to make us believe the earth is round. What possibly would all governments gain by lying about it?
"yeah yeah, flat-earthers are wrong, low-hanging fruit; but how about NDT getting the cause of moon phases wrong though-"
"When I was growing up in the sixties, we didn't have computers or calculators and smart phones. We needed to use our own thought processes to figure out our world and universe. In fact when the first calculators became commercially available, if we got caught using them in classes, we were called out for cheating. Now when my nephew was in school it was a requirement for him to have a graphing calculator for his math classes. That is not education in my opinion. That is only teaching someone how to punch numbers into an instrument that with do the calculations for you. I may be sounding a bit cynical with this statement but, let's not forget the internet that brought the youth of today, to say such things as, ""If it's on the internet, It must be true"". I completely agree Dr. Tyson that our educational system has failed these children. We are no longer teaching the youth to use their minds for thought processes but to use machines to do the works their minds would normally have to do to explore the world and universe around them.  
I'm not saying that every child in not intelligent, just a large portion of them are being improperly educated on how to use their minds correctly. Again this is from my own personal experiences with modern day youth. Do not demonize me for stating provable facts of my own experience with the general population in the area where I reside."
You pathetic am glad u removed my comment ffs
