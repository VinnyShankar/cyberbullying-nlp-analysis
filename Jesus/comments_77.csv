Obviously that (Shaquille was the best bigman there is....
Fake. Shaq can't shoot
Too bad he couldn't DO THAT IN A REAL GAME!!!!
Big Diesel........will love ya forever buuuuuut; where was this during the LakeShow years?! We could've gotten at least one more! Who could've stopped that added to his low block dominance?!
"Orlando Shaq was special and if he kept that body, David Robinson might have retired with no ring."
The Unstoppable Phenom
Why i do not give that guy from the denver nuggets  jokic any props. In todays NBA Shaq would avg 35 15 6 a night!!!!  jokic in the 90s would be a bench player.
A healthy Shaq = mj older brother
Where are these vids coming from 30 yrs later
RIP to the people that think Pippen is actually playing real defense here.
Must been what Kobe saw in him lol
Nice
SHAQ IS STOPPED WHEN YOU PUT HIM IN FRONT OF THE BASKET AT THE FREETHROW LINE LOL
He could do it all but he was a bully and he wanted to punish people down low because he knew that gave his team the advantage every night but he could do what we are seeing here if he wanted to
"Shaq was huge quick and had incredible footwork and was a master at using his bodyweight to overpower opponents. There's a reason why not every huge athletic player has risen to shaq's level. Old heads would say that wilt was better just because he was more athletic but compared to the skill level of shaq, its not even close. Bbq chicken"
And he lost his touch listening to coaches which made his two instead of three dimensional.
"I had those USA Pippen Nikes in 8th grade. Damn those were sick. ( but horrible for lateral or blverticle movement, like blocks on your ankles ) Ofcourse my dumb ass dumped em quick for the Pennys. Wish my shoes lasted then like they do now."
"Seem Orlando Shaq had a J. When he got to the Lakers, something happen to it. Lol"
Defense is so hard
Young shaq was diff more agile he had a guard mental.
Young Shaq was something to behold
Like kobe said if shaq had his work ethic he'll be the greatest of all time
If he would have made this shooting apart of his nba game in prime shaq he probably would have played longer instead of getting hurt from pol fouling him bc he was a beast
Mane Footwork Is So Good...
No need to guard him near the foul line
In these non formal games shaqs shot seems to be way better. Saw another 1 on 1 video where he was hitting 3s nonstop post retirement
I'm trying to figure out how come he doesn't have a mid-range or higher percentage at the free throw line?
That's the Shaq Kobe wanted they would've been unstoppable
Shaq shoulda stayed lean. Guess he didn't have to though. People just forget how athletic he was..
Reminds me of myself
"Until this day, i need an answer ! 
How the hell did they miss putting this man on the 1st dream team ?!!"
Second move was official
An Orlando healthy shaq scored 35k pts on 2s 50% free throws and plays 20yrs maybe 6 7 chips
The way he moved at that size was incredible
"One on one, not many people could do anything vs a competent 7 footer. If he had to just back to the basket, there's nothing smaller players could do."
He couldn't do anything like that against any reasonable sized NBA defender as he couldn't even hit free throws. He made basketball into a full contact sport because he had no real basketball skills.
Tween.... Cross... Pull up!!!! Ok Shaq!!! Man I miss the days of watching him and Kobe win 3 straight!!
Embiid wouldve had them ready to retire
Pippen got cooked and would have gotten cooked even if they were playing hard
Why did he suck at free throws his entire career?
Shooting long and mid range like aint no thang.
I remember this shaq this thr McDonald's USA shaq this mf was a beast at that time
"I would have Hacked A Shaq, game over"
"In the words of Kobe, this guy could have been one of the best ever if he tired..."
"A lot of people don't know Shaq had a lot more in his arsenal than he let on. The coaches told him to focus on certain things, and that's what he did. Same with Rodman. Rodman could do more that just rebound but the coaches wanted him focused on defense and he that's what he did. Dennis could score if he wanted to though."
Shoot a free throw
Thats neon vedol not shaq .
not what Olajuwon said
big ass rim
Man can shoot. How did he miss that many free throws?
If he stayed like this when he was with the Lakers dude would have had more than 4 rings
Shaq is the most dominant center ever but he can't shoot for shit period.  Never mind his free throws. Show me a high light in any one game  where  he took multiple jump shot ill help u i don't exist.
"That Shaq is in my all time 5 as a PF. Dream team could have been Admiral (C), Shaq (PF), Pippen / Bird / Barkley (SF), MJ (SG), Magic (PG)
and a bench a mile deep"
Dwight can thank God for not meeting the 260 version of Shaq
How did Shaq lose his shooting especially from the FT
"We almost never saw that shot in games, at least never consistently."
too bad the kid had such potential...
"I'd like to think he could have actually developed a midrange game if he had needed to. He came up though in the low block power game era. This and the Jordan clip say one thing, that All Star elbow J, something else."
I did not know that Shaq could shot
"GAAAH!!! The only missing component for the PERFECT 92 Dream Team....Robinson, Ewing, O'Neal at Center???? But they HAD to go with collage player of the year...granted they though Laettners ego would be better for the team."
The most dominant force in nba history. His run with the lakers was the best center play of all time.
Shaquille O'Embiid
BBQ chicken!!!!!
"To think if would had stayed in shape and kept in the gym, top 3 of all time"
I see why Kobe was on Shaq's case like he was...Shaq could have been even GREATER. He used to have an actual bag.
A three pointer by Shaq? Scored in a nonchalant way? Double-u Tee Ef
10 hours of footage for 45 sec
100 takes inbetween they edited out
Prime shaq
How the heck was he a notorious terrible free throw shooter?
This is before Shaq hurt his wrist early in his career and was actually a decent free-throw shooter.
Why is Shaq using a tennis ball?
Where did that J go?
Looks like a Trex mixed with a rabbit
Thats not fair bro lol
Honestly Jordan changed the game but he would be a Westbrook in todays game right as he was leaving other bigger athletic players were coming in
You not beating that shaq
Shaq was a Monster.  The only one who could stop Shaq was the foul line.
I dnt remember Pippen being on dreamteam 2
Push him towards the free throw line.
Pippen ain't even playing d. He would lock him up so quick. He dribbles too high and has no fingertip handling. Too easy.
When Shaq is hittin' 3s it's game over
Knick Knack Shaq Attack
youd think he was 90% from the free throw line
Shaq was a problem and couldve been more so if he used his finness game more and kept his weight down.
Sadly in a real game anything outside of 3 feet away from the hoop and Shaq had a hard time hitting it.
All that and cant shoot i free throw truly tuff lolll
Black Steph Curry!!
But he can't make a free throw Don't make sense
If he only could shoot free throws.
If shaq played in this era he would develop a 3 point shot.  Then everyone would stop talking about who was the most dominant player.
"Can't do it in a game, it don't count"
Shaqs athleticism from a big man is unparalleled by any other center
Jersey
"This was super cocky/confident/hungry for a title Shaq, that used to tell kids to get lost who stopped him in the street for an autograph."
When the jokes about Shaq shooting abilities started i used to wonder why. I've always known Shaq to have handles and be able to shoot.
Shaq would be top 3 in any draft in history easily.
These Gambians bruh
Just imagine if Shaq was in shape his whole tenure in LA . Him and Kobe would have 9 rings
No Sh*t Sherlock
Why doesn't Scottie just put a body on him? :D :D
You guys are trippn alot of these nba players can do more they are just not instructed to do so they play what they are best at shaq always had skills  but when you big like shaq explosive like Westbrook why wouldn't you take advantage of your gifts
"I'm the biggest Kobe and Jordan fan but if I'm starting a team,  the first person I'm picking is Shaq"
But he can't hit a free throw
Shaq with a reliable mid range jumper is terrifying. The man was already damn near unstoppable.
"Wow! And against the hardest, most pressured defensive I've ever seen nonetheless!"
People forget how agile Shaq was.  Dude had handles.
Pippen is almost as tall as Shaq?!
I chuckle when they say Shaq couldnt play today or guard someone like Jokic because he is so slow... LOL. Even the huge LA Shaq could still move fast.
Damn wish Shaq was shooting more jus imagine if Shaq had a jump shot talking about dominance at its high peak he would be the best ever big man nobody would come close not even mike
This guy is pretty good.
He can shot ???  I don't believe this is shaq
Since When shaq know how to shoot
Orlando Shaq hit different than LA Shaq
Imagine him in Chicago with jordan
somone should draft this guy
My favorite center
Giannis
Just goes 2 Show that even Pros Obviously get Nervous when it really Counts because Shaq Rarely Showed this Kind of Touch in a Game. He Mainly Dunked & did Layups! This Touch should've Shot 75% from the Free Throw line!!
"I remember in the Finals, Shaq was throwing elbows at Mutombo and the fouls were called on Mutombo. that ain't right"
dawg I get why you and kobe slpit buitch you got the potential for to shoot...and you ain't cultivate that shit???
If anyone wants to know why Kobe said Shaq could have been the greatest player. Here's a small introduction.
This footage looks good...
Young Shaq was nice
Underated
This before he bulked up and put on all his muscle
Lil did he know he was sparking the evolution in big mem.
Shaq would have been illegal today.
What an athlete
Can't shoot free throws but can do all that it blows my mind what a beast though still goes to show
"He pisses me off. So skilled, but he played too much"
"he used to make his free throws too IN PRACTICE only.  Another reason shaq was soooo overrated because in games he hit less than 50% of free throws, average rebounder for someone his size, and only had one move on offense which was to just play bully ball because refs let him offensive charge all day long.  Thats like me playing grade school kids and dominating them.  Seriously, if it werent for the rules back then he would foul out of every game in todays game"
We need a shaqumentary
Shaq used to be able to shoot really well but as he got older he refused to wear glasses thus why he can't even shoot free throws anymore
All these effortless outside hoops yet he struggled to hit a FT
"In reality he had no shooting touch. 
His game was playing bully ball in the paint."
Put Big Ben Wallace on him!
People forget how athletic young Shaq was.
How can the man shoot that well and couldn't hit a free throw?
"You could put a body on this Shaq though and it was possible to stop him. That was not possible against bulky Lakers shaq. He would never have been as dominant if he kept this form, even though it was his most aesthatically pleasing form of all. He abandoned much finesse for unstoppable brute force."
If Shaq had even half of Kobes or MJs work ethic he would have been no doubt the best player of all time. Dude was a freak of nature.
This is like Ben Simmons Summer work out videos.
Remember he put that thang on Mike #DreamShake
Put Rodman on him
What was his FT% again??
why couldnt he make free throws! :P
If only he worked out and stayed in shape during the offseason
One of the kind. Physical freak.
"Home team Olympics are always explosive! 

It's a joke."
U make all these 15 footers and struggle at the line smh
Jokic is lucky he is playing in todays game
"1 on Free throw line, is a different story."
Imagine if was consistent in working out and keeping his weight in check. 10 chips lowkey lol
Back when Shaq had the men who made him.
With work ethic he would have been the best ever.
Hakeem Olajuwon has entered the chat
No defense formed against him shall prosper.
"A few months later Kobe, Iverson, Allen, Marbury would make their NBA debut. Tupac and Biggie was still alive. I was about to be a junior in high school. Good Times"
Wilt never did that
Why was I waiting for him to say 'BBQ Chicken' and start licking his fingers? lol
Shaq was slick before he got fat
"Shaq was more talented than he showed in real games. He could handle and pass the ball at a high level. BTW - same for Kareem, Wilt and Russell. These guys were great basketball players who just happened to be big. They stayed near the basket because that's what their coaches told them to do."
What happened to him when he went to the lakers? I never saw ball handling skills like that in a game
Probably this was edited from a 6 hour long video..
"When Shaq got to the Lakers he bulked up too much to be able to take those jump shots anymore..in this clip it looks like he got a bit more range, but by 1999 to 2004 or 05 99.9% of his points were underneath the basket or dunks."
but somehow he couldnt hit a free throw???
very intense one on one.
"If he could shoot lije that, why was his free trhrow % so low?"
Favorite player of all time
Shaq with a jump shot would have literally been the scariest thing in the history of basketball.
BBQ chicken alert!
"I saw Shaq play the University of Arizona live back in the day. He was amazing, but the team around him not so much. It was a very memorable game."
i nver seen shaq shoot jumpers ? why didnt he do this in games
young Shaq was no joke .
On PIPPEN!
Shot could have been the greatest if he kept his weight down an olayed more like this how do u stop him with out bringing 5
That's BlueChips Shaq....father time was the only one capable of stopping Shaq.
Actually had Jwork
Is it too late to swap Christian Laettner for Shaq?
He need a nutritionist and trainer
Should have looked that way his entire NBA career what could have been .
So many long 2s
They asked Kobe what if Shaq had his work ethic and he replied by saying he would've been the goat.
I not go lie he can shoot but the jump shot is of balance
And couldnt make a free throw regularly.
Foul him. Make him go to the line lol
Can hit pull up jumpers but can't hit a free throw
Point Center
He shoulda put on these moves when ever he went to the free throw line.
Diesel could dominate all eras
Nice short
Nobody's trying to stop him
Fun facts did u Kno Shaq can crossover and shoot of dribble
Just push him to the free throw area
NAS one love video intro
"With respect to Hakeem, young Shaq was the most agile big man ever"
Maaannnnn......that's A.I.!
good but rodman locked him down
Pippen tall af...
Chael Sonnen beat him 1v1. Google it.
too bad he couldn't stop the cheese burglar
I saw 96 team in Atlanta... Shaq looked like a high schooler playing middle school kids
"He never called a foul, didn't wanna miss."
BLUE CHIPS.
No Hakeem out there
It's weird seeing a young agile Shaq lol
"Where the F* were these soft touch, mid range, pull up jumpers for, umm, his entire career?"
Sounded like Kenny yelling in the background but he was getting Hakeem Olajuwon water
"Mj has dpoy, he can easily stop shaq,"
THIS is why Kobe was mad at him. Shaq could have been the greatest ever if worked on all aspects of his game & stayed in premier shape. Smh
I always remember hack a shaq... and then he missed both free throws.
If he would have stayed at that weight...
With 4 rings i still don't think we ever saw this mans full potential shit is crazy
Looks smooth
If only he trained like kobe
Shaq was the total package as far as big men outside of free throw shooting. This was the only weakness in his game and he had everything else. PRIME SHAQ THE GREATEST FORCE IN THE HISTORY OF BASKETBALL!!!!
This is what KOBE WAS SAYING ABOUT HIM STAYING IN SHAPE!!!! RIP MAMBA08/24
"Kobe was right, if Shaq just grinded a lil' more instead of relying on raw power, they would've had 10 rings probably."
They did the same thing with ben Simmons relax
Shaq was nimble on his feet he'll cross you over. Just goes to show how good these nba guys is
Shot a jumper dang
"It's crazy how he can make those shots easily, but when it came to free throws he sucked."
This dude was incredible man fav C of all time
Man look at those old school rims
"No offense,  but shaq did not maximize his potential."
Embiid is the skillset Shaq would've had IF HE STAYED HIS ASS IN THE GYM LIKE KOBE SAID
That arch is undefeated lol
Kobe wasn't bullshitting if he would've stayed in the gym it would've been over
The best way to guard shaq is to not guard him and let him shoot wide open. He can't shoot open shots. He can shoot shots while guarded.
How can you not love this dude!
I dont understand how he couldnt shoot free throws. Pressure is a mother faker
Bro was athletic
When USA is USA
"Maaannnn , Why Couldn't  U Do That On The Lakers. You An Kobe Definitely  Would've  Been Unstoppable."
His technique is very good.
The ultimate bully baller
By the greatest defender of all time Scottie P!
Shaq was making Pippen inconfortable with no handles but Pippen would lock down modern shooting guards and Small forward easily apparently !
Orlando Shaq was no joke!!!
Probably my favorite gorilla...
Nice to see big fella in his youth days bro
"Shaq is not a shooter. 
Those are just 4 head made from taking 400,000 shots in practice 
But he's a beast in the paint"
Stop it..he was maxin out n this clip
This is like watching Ben Simmons in the off-season
Embiid would have gave Shaq problems
Shaq-Fu
Pissed all on Pippen with his salty ass
10x better bag than Lebron
They're also allowing him to dribble- anytime he puts the ball on the floor its an easy grab
Imagine had he had that LeBron diet and stayed top notch fit. Talking Bill Russell championships in the new era of real NBA and the best player to ever touch a basketball. He was still better than Kobe ever was.
that rock like a nerf ball in shaqs hands lol
Just imagine if he had that in his arsenal of weapons while on the floor how more dominant this man would have been
"Shaq casually dribbling...
Ball: 6 feet in the air on every bounce"
MJ IS the goat. But I always say you know who SHOULD be the goat? Shaq. I will DIE on this hill.
Nobody could guard this guy even if they tried. Players got roster spots that otherwise wouldn't be in the league just so they could use their fouls against him.
Shaq put some arc on those jump shots.
A.I. altered
Cookin scottie
"Yep, people have definitely forgot to that Shaq had skills."
Handle as a  big man is prefect
96 team vs 2012 team?
but he couldnt do that in games
He looks good how he put all that weight on
Problem for real
Thats the GOAT before the bs. Look at the way he's moving but that big and strong.
Don't forget young shaq and penny on orlando magic beat the bulls
GODDAMNIT! What could've been had he developed this... SMH.
"Man, if he would have developed that shiz we might not be talking about  LeBron because Shaq would be pushing the ball on the break sometimes and finding teammates if he had a tight enough handle, and pulling up for midrange jumpers."
"Shaq's biggest problem was himself; He was DOMINANT in a way not seen since Wilt; When he CHOSE to... WAY too often, by his own admission, he was lazy, would come in to camps Drastically overweight and just did not have the work ethic, which always pissed Kobe off"
"The original ""Black Steph Curry"""
And Mr Pippen rocking the Nike Air hahhaahhahaha
That was rapping shaq.. when he was spitting better raps. Than rappers today.
Thats crazyy
Big Shaq Diesel was a force to be reckoned with.
Man ... Shaq ain't have no set shot
Because big men weren't encouraged to shoot we didn't get to see this part unlock in his game.
It's always easier when your bigger and taller than everyone
Damn bro.... if kobe played with THIS shaq???? wtf
Prime Shaq
Back for 5 minutes when he could actually shoot lol
That's that shit Kobe was saying. Shaq could been wayyyyy better then he was. Just wanted Shaq to his Match Work Ethic so they could be the Greatest.
Could've taken it to the paint every time but said nah. No one was or is or will be more dominant.
Imagine Shaq with Kobe's work ethic. OMG
Kobe was right...he d be the GOAT...only if he had that mindset...
Bro handles tho
And this is why KOBE stayed mad at Shaq lol
He only ever did that in this practice. Smh
Only thing that stops shaq is the free throw line
All that shooting went out in prime time tho aye big fella
Shag and Kobe Bryant
This is prime Shaq. Unstoppable.
"People forget and those days a lot of those athletes could do a lot more.
 They just stuck to the role."
Sgaq in his prime was an unstoppable force!!
"It's light practice defense, but that's still against Pippen - 8 straight NBA 1st Team All-Defense selections. A lot of people think Shaq was just a bull in a China shop, but he had great footwork and skill."
"This is why Shaq said he's playing in the NBA right now, and his name is Giannis"
"This is why nba talent level is just different. Against an average dude shaq can do all these moves, at nba speed, diff story, even though he was still dominate"
Shaq Fu!
If he could have shot free throws that good..
That Shaq would avg 40 in todays game. And the Lakers Version would have two 3peats
he will be goat if he has kobe's work ethic
"If he had the work ethic of mj, shaq would be crowding mj in the goat debate"
"Fun fact: Shaq once said in an interview growing up, before he really hit his growth spurt, he wanted to play PG... so over snd over woukd develop his game as a PG... then he became 7'1 lol"
Shaq looking like Giannis
But.. Hakeem and Big Macs
1996 was a Amazing year for sports in general
Shaq did to MJ too in the all star
Athletic Shaq is just unreal
Not the original stretch 5
that pull up jumper felt wrong
Embiid .0
I make em when they count....big games or 1v1
Before Shaq got lazy!!!
When he was in shape he was unstoppable period
Shaq with a consistent mid range shot is basically wilt lol back in wilts time offensive players couldn't bully defenders out the way or theyd be called for an offensive foul. So no aggressive post ups relegated wilt to shooting a bunch of mid range shots and fadeaways. He averaged 50 on mostly post fades. Thats what Shaq would've been doing with a consistent midrange shot. Bully you down low then pull it out to 15-20 ft and kill you from there.
Mans forgot. Smh n still be doubting the old dawgs
Yet he couldn't make a damn freethrow with the lakers
"Baby shaq was different, his handle and movement was way better than ppl give him credit for. The most dominant 5 to ever play the game"
This is the version of Shaq the NBA is very fortunate it never got the full brunt of
Then he got fat
I knew Shaq had handles for a big guy... Na he just has handles period holy shit
Most NBA players have a much deeper bag than we see on TV
Wasn't even using his super power
Shaq was a guard. That was the first time I seen Pippen not play defense
But but they couldn't shoot. No dummies they didnt shoot. Shooting is a learned skill meaning any player can learn it. There is nothing new under the sun
Imagine if Shaq would have stayed in shape
Shaq was 10 at the time too.
So why he missed a lot of free throws?
The NBA players today are not as physically imposing as they were.  I wonder why?
If only his work ethic was like Kobe or Mike's he would have been greater than both of them
He was create-a-player before it was a thing.
Dark matter shaq
This is a beautiful clip if shaq wanted to play the way centers do now he would have been the goat he was capable of being a god shooter and was the most explosive coordinated big man ever
Could a been the goat but he was too lazy
If he just stuck with it and had the mentality to practice like Kobe he would have been unstoppable
Best thing to happen to jordan was Shaq being traded
MJ couldnt even stop shaq 1 on 1
does this man have that much accuracy?
Why couldn't he do that from the free-throw  line?
The original Dirk!!
So light on his feet back then.
If he would of stayed in shape like this he would been more dominant
"Why Shaq doesn't look like a 7 footer in this vid?
(Even a 6'4 GP looks tall standing next to Shaq)"
GOAT center forward period
How bout them freethrows
"I liked Orlando Shaq more than Laker Shaq.  He was more fluid and athletic back then but Laker Shaq was more reliant on his size.  I think, just guessing, Shaq would had probably had a longer career if he stayed at this size than the size he was when he was winning with the Lakers."
Loooooooonnnnnnggggg time ago. LOL.
"If that dude had a work ethic. He could have been in the same conversation with MJ.

LNP"
NBA DNT let players play frfr
funny seeing shaq and pippen together
WhOOOOO
"One word, clunky"
I remember Orlando Shaq. Very impressive. He shot 50% from the foul line for his career though. Him and Wilt.
Shaq just splash a three pointer????
That would've been scary to deal with fr
dude can shoot
Newheads think shaq couldn't play in today's weak era but in reality he would be a mix of Giannis and Jokic
I think this was before his shooting wrist injury which is why his shot was so fluid.
Pippen is tall!!
"Shaq was right when he said he would be playing like Giannis if he played today.
He had handles which he could have improved on if he was required to."
1st dribbling n den P-board(travelling)
"So everyone is gonna ignore those HANDLES?!
He's doing moves like a fucking 2020 point guard out there..being a Shaq. In 1996!!

Got abused by MJ in the eastern finals the same year"
Only footage missing is Shaq dominating at the free throw line.  Lol
It's like another Ben Simmons off season video
"I love how there are highlights of someone's made jump shots (Ben Simmons), when we know the guy shoots 49% from the FT line with nobody guarding him. Like I can shoot 89 in a round of golf, and hit 4 drives out of bounds, and still show you 4 drives I ripped down the middle of the fairway."
I just told some guy on here how versatile shaq was.
black steph curry
the biggest what ifs.if shaq was with dream team 1 instead of christian laetner
Jesus saves
Would wish to see the daddy throw one down in that rim
We all thinking the same thing - was an alltime great and shuda been the greatest
He can shoot three points on practice.
"Man, just imagine if he and Kobe knew then what he knows now. They woulda never broke up and only God knows how many rings they woulda got!"
If shaq is 7+ Pip was 7 or 6 elem
40 ball handle 20 pull up mid range
Ben simmons off season vibes. Imagine a shaq with a 3
Gotta give the W to Shaq
Imagine if Shaq developed a Timmy D middy game
Bro wtf if this man could do this why tf did he not do this he would be the goat
Why didnt he do this in a regular nba game
So this why 2k put out a Shaq card every year with damn near 99 everything
Man of Shaq was on the LeBron diet and exercise routine with that MJ and Kobe mentality... No one would ever question the GOAT.
96 dream team was the 2nd greatest Team ever and Pip won the MVP. They never had any close games while the 08 and 12 teams both almost lost a few games.
Its nothing more than a shoot around
"God had to be fair , so he gave Shaq laziness. That's all I'm gonna say."
If Shaq worked harder and actually practiced like Kobe. I think he would have been in the GOAT conversation
"Shaq had a very nice jump shot, but his free throw was terrible. I wonder why that is"
So he can shoot
Free throws?????????
Who was on 96 all star team?
"Man. If Shaq would've developed a middie or even just stayed leaner, like closer to his weight in Orlando he would've been even more dominant."
"Shaqs talent was unreal,  imagine if he had the work ethic Kobe had...man's had a HOF career off pure talent!! Big, strong, quick and athletic with footwork and handle to match"
Documented last 15 footer of his Career!
Then he started eating more...
"Hilarious thing is, if he wanted to bully everyone, he could just back them down and dunk on demand. He is taking mid range jumpers and hook shots here. Man was a freak."
Why he couldn't shoot him the game but he Steph Curry at practice? Lol
Shaq should have been in the 1992 Team also
The Incredible Shaq
Send him to the line
Imagine Shaq could shoot like kd and dribble like pg he will be the greatest ever lol
He a 2k post scorer. Nobody can stop them mfs
Its a shame he never got to show this side of his game in the beginning stages of his nba career. I feel him showing this could have possibly led to the magic getting a possible championship against the rockets
The ball seems like 5 in his hand
Why is he using a smaller basketball tho
Rodman held Shaq scoreless in 96
Bro can actually shoot
Literally unstoppable.
Could you imagine if he had a jump shot?
Free throws?
End game shaq
Damn if Shaq stayed fit his whole career he woulda been a completely different beast
No D
"If only shaq trained and focused on his body, he might have been the GOAT."
"All right, why don't you practice some free throws now?"
If ONLY Orlando Shaq put in the work... he'd make Jordan and LeBron look like children.
dude i never see shaq move so smooth
How tf is he able to pull off jumpshots yet still can't shoot free throws
"This doesn't make any sense, he should have jump shot his free throws instead of being embarrassed to make them."
He just got to big to shoot the ball. Which worked out amazing.
"This version of Shaq could have been special. If I was Kobe,  I'd have been pissed at him too."
Why do stars actually play in the us national team back then and now we just got borderline all stars and role players
So unbelievable!!
Bro can hit off the drivble pull up jumpers but cant hit FT's
Wow i never know he can shoot that good..
"Bruhs got the ugliest jumped in the game confirmed. Why is my man shooting like he has to shoot over 9'13"" defenders"
"""Im closer to steph than you are to me"" -Shaq"
If shaq had kept this motivation he had when he was younger and continued to polish his game he would've definitely been the goat. He barely cared in LA and dominated now imagine him working on his bag like Hakeem.
Skinny Shaq was a force of science
That one-two tween the legs was so deadly. It gave him the shiftiness and explosiveness needed
Jokic would get clapped by shaq or any other center before is era
Nothing beats when he did the Dream Shake on MJ.
"""where do i put my hand''
Put it on your ass"
Shaq if he played in today's NBA.
I never seen Shaq take jump shots in three pointers that far back
Those are some old school rims lol
Truly believe what Kobe said . If he add his work ethic. Shaq would be the greatest . Easily.
This era would be a piece of cake for Shaq
The best Center of all time
"There has never even been a double team that could stop him , let alone one person!"
Shaq was cooking them Lol.
Dream team 2. And shaq was hitting jumpers!
Only Yao could stop him.
People don't realize that Shaq was actually out of shape during his prime years. He got fat and happy in LA. If he would have stayed in Orlando shape he would easily be in the goat discussion
shaq would play pg in todays game
"If this the Shaq kobe got they would've won 7,8 atlest"
"There it is
Shaq and his infamous middy pull up"
Send em left or make shoot from his left hand
was this Shaq before his wrist got fucked up?
Worked on his jump shot after 50 yrs nice
Ben Simmons sucks
He is demigod like This but every good things has a and if he play always like This that time he probebly get injured
McDonald's cup Shaq
"Tf didn't he use that side step 3 in game.... actually stop

I'm thankful I got to see him how he was. Just so fast quick drop step dunk over 3 people . Have 30 and 20 with 8 blocks and like 2 or 3 dimes. But the most dominating 15-15 from the field u ever saw. If he's got it in the Paint hes dunking, or hooking @ 80 percent clip. Breaking backboards and shit , straight bodying people all fucking game . Shit was crazy first years in Orlando and then followed with kobe, that shit was a good time to be a fan."
I feel a pain in my chest.
I can't lie Shaq had some xtra tricks in his bag but he played in a era were he was taught that a center plays down low the boxes and the paint is were a 7fter dominates he hits free-throw when it counts
"Bro, just cooked Scotty Pippin harder than him, and his six rings"
The best center in his era
Nba never disappoints with da comtent
First
