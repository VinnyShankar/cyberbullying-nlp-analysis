"*Peter playing basketball failing to hide hes identify*

Quater-billion People: i n t e r e s t i n g"
Andrew Garfield is an amazing actor: watch Never Let Me Go......
Andrew's spidey is best and perfect comic spidey EVER
Bro literally traveled more than a tourist
they filmed this scene at my school
travel
Wtf why does this have a quarter billion views??
he will cheat w
"And this is why Ton's Spiderman doesn't play American football, it's like when Quicksilver participated in the Olympics"
Love how much he's travelling before landing the slam dunk
Spider man name?
"Director: Lets have Peter blatantly embarrass the school hothead (basically unprovoked) for several minutes while playing lighthearted music to cover the fact he' s now the bully! That's our hero kids, the one using superpowers to make someone feel bad and vandalize a school basketball court. I clicked cause this has 224M views but why this scene? Criticisms in the comments are totally valid."
"Wow, flash could have guessed he was Spider-Man by that basketball sticking to his right hand."
Cheating as nigga he was travelling
"I like how he didn't even layup the ball, he just carried it lol, idk how I only noticed it now"
Travel
"Fun fact: that girl Peter was talking to you has a crush on him, and was said to be black cat sidekick in her canceled solo film."
Who massacred the framerate ?
That jump was a dumb move.
Bro has some W rizz.
"When u are a superhero, vs a normal human, the win is not glorious."
Who would not want to get revenge on the bully!
Mans broke 3 NBA rules in 1 move
Best place for painting
"Takes a basket ball.
Does a football run.
Seems legit."
https://youtube.com/@amezings046
Why are you painting on the gym floor?
Thats what id done...
Can't believe Doss the coward used to bully kids in high school
He traveled
Yo this is terrible.
Everyone loves the feeling of standing up to a bully.
"While the movie is just fine, for some strange reason the Frame Rate of the footage here feel weird. Like it has that soap opera effect that feels cheap."
maturity is realising peter is the bully here
What was she expecting in the basketball court?
"Damn never saw this film, what a shitty acting and shitty VFX"
Ye movie YouTube pe to nhi hai to kaha se dekhu?
"Oh boy, AI generated frames and a sharpness filter. Just what every movie needs."
SPIDER MAN NO WAY HOME 20 21 PETER PARKER
"As a basketball player myself, i m thinking why the hell are they painting on the basketball court in the first place where the school team clearly having a scrimmage session. If i were him i would first get their asses of the court."
pretty girl with glasses
Shot doesn't count. Travel.
This fps are so high and good
That flash guy aint even that bad
"TASM haters says ""he is really protecting that secret identity so well""

Look at Tobey's maguire spiderman

Dude's literally dragging his lunch tray by a web in a school cafeteria.

Tom is the perfect Spider-Man/Peter parker"
Ada yg tau siapa nama wanita yg di ganggu flash pada scene ini?
Traveling
Man who paints a banner in the middle of a sports hall while the basketball team is practicing. what a horrible person!
every universe has a flash and everyone has a version of flash in their own lives and we all strive for the day we can do this to our own flashes and no I am not talking about the DC flash :)
pretty sure he took more than 3 steps for that dunk
Andrew Garfield was the best Spider-Man.
No Sir
Movie link
Because hormones driven teenagers are aloud unsupervised free time.  Right....
me personally i could never get ankled by parker
"""With great power comes the great responsibility to dunk on mother fuckers"" 
-Uncle Ben Probably"
Revenge porn for nerds
Awwwww kiss him!!!!
Is he related to John Garfield?
this movie is so bad
This is an exact dream of about 10% of HS boys.
travelled
Parker is ballin
"travel, offensive foul."
every bullied kids dream... that never happened
"Spiderman 1 : Flash bullies Peter
The Amazing Spider-Man : Peter bullies Flash"
Did you know that this is the most watched clip of a movie that you can find on YouTube?
Wow that is bad.
I don't get it? Why would the flash not use his superspeed?
cringe travel
120 fps sucks
That girl is cute
0:07 that might've been the worst layup attempt ever choreographed in a movie
bro i saw spiderman vs flash in basketball and i thought of the superhero the Flash until i realized i was wrong then realized they're in two entire different universes
why is this movie's refresh rate so high ? Its so ugly!
And do you know why everybody forgot about this later... because it was written in the script.
Questi video devono essere in lingua Italiana.
The shitty 60fps...makes it look like a cheap day time drama.
the best spiderman
He went full Darryl Dawkins.
This constant need to scale videos to a higher framerate is getting irritating
This scene is so cringe. This is what happens when you hire idiots writers.
spiderman is the villain in the scene . that girl was in the wrong
"travel, no bucket"
Every simps wet dream.  Thank god for comic book movies.
Only a Libtard would be painting in a Basketball court and then shout at the Basketball players when the ball hits her.
I still think she had the fault for painting on a fucking basket ball court
Nobody talking about how weak that layup was lmao
"I have never seen a Spider-Man film, I have to say this writing is terrible.

Random girl with paint buckets painting right next to the Basketball court. Ball hits a paint bucket and knocks it over. ""YoU dId ThAt On PuRpOsE !!1!"" ""No BuT i ShOuLdA,,,, bEtTeR wAtCh YoUr BaCk 1!!!"" And then Spiderman I assume that is walks over and picks the paint bucket up like hero.

First of all why the fuck is she painting there? Second of all why would she accuse a very obvious accident that was realistically her fault to begin with on someone acting with malicious intent? Why did he reply so aggressively and threaten her?"
So satisfying to watch
90 FPS
Peter 3 all day
Look at the lack of Tyrone in this scene. So shameful.
That's a travel foul
"OK, first of all that was TRAVELLING"
oops
Puase at 1:42 to check out some classic American *_17 year old students._*
"Well technically, it's not Flash's fault because they were playing basketball normally. Something unusual is her painting in there which makes me confused."
"Damn that shot from the guy that flash rejected was really bad. He just through it into the air, not even to the ring."
soda!
This scene is the teenage dream
"Flash did nothing wrong.

You set up paints next to their halfcourt? That's on YOU when your paint gets dumped... and if a ball comes your way, you don't just pick it up and hold onto it like Peter did. Flash could've been less forceful about it, but he was in the right.
 
And then go back to the first Tobey Maguire Spiderman. Flash was sitting there minding his own business, and what happens? A tray of food is dumped all up and down his back at lunch, and then Peter (the guy who did it) did not apologize or anything. He quietly left the room... and everyone saw. Not only from his perspective, ANYONE would assume it was intentional... Peter showed a lack of remorse, and needed his butt kicked.
 
Flash is Maligned in the movies."
1:48 Hanamichi Sakuragi is that you?
"1:52 1:54
Liz Allen ?"
Shaquille took lessons from Parker.
the bad 60 fps conversion makes this far less watchable.
"Didnt he kinda break basketball rules, dude didnt dribble"
"0:23 Wow, Spider-Man already wearing panda dunks back in 2012!"
wtf is this smooth filter it looks so awful
"I frankly didn't like this characterization of Peter Parker all that much.
And Flash would have tried to kick his #$% within a few seconds."
The Shaq attack haha
When you go a bit too far making your point......
"J. Jonah Jameson was right, the guy is bully and a vandal."
"im sorry but,thats a travel"
Travel+dunk=
Who wrote this That's not cool at all
Totally out of character. Peter Parker was never a dick.
gays.
Jesus parker you are a freak
And the world record for worst attempt at a layup goes to...
That was a travel and a charge.
"There was a time when even the West understood heroes had the virtue of modesty. Now that all the average young westerner does is worship themselves, it's time for heroes to be egomaniacs who abuse their power, to sell to egomaniac kids in the audience. Even our heroes are debased now. Fitting for the society they are in."
Gaaaaaaayy
Well. He brought it alright.
"so bad, cringe"
"The 60fps freaks me out. I'm 50 years old and this has made a Hollywood movie look like it was filmed on a phone, in the actual school gym on everyone's actual lunch break. It all looks like behind the scenes footage now."
How old are these folks
The reason I dislike fiction and super power movies. Just imagination!
This 90 FPS is giving me motion sickness
TRAVEL! (Loud as whistle blows)
Geez Parker.  You really are a freak
x265 10Bit videos are the best.
That was a charge
doesnt anyone find it strange that someone paints while there are some people playing basket ball right there? she was asking for that bucket of paint to tip over
Traveling.
Flash's unearned merit.
Travelling
Parker is a bully
Oh hell yeah that's cool
"Yeah, flash is an ass, but why would she be doing a painting project in the gym during basketball practice? Shitty writing."
"This was dumb for alot of reasons
-She says he did it on purpose, no way.

-Why is she painting on the court?

-he tells her to watch her back? Wtf

-she didnt need help picking up the bucket

-peter travels and charges the net lol"
*Car Honk*
"im not lying.everytime watching that gum pop,its so sexy and satisfying. i would love to kiss that lip"
That layup was terrible
60fps clips are cursed
"What a terrible movie, with terrible writing."
What i thought flash was brown?...this stupid race swap
That's a foul.
No Spiderman of mine will travel like that on the ball court.
No real basketball player approved of this scene during production. Otherwise Peter would have at least dribbled the ball before dunking.
I wonder how he hides his identity so well
Bro had infinite gather step
That was travel
He was a boring Spiderman
"That is muscular Adam zempa , Played Flash before joining Australia cricket team"
Man why is everyone so cringe in this movie
Why didnt Flash use his super speed magic powers?
Travel..
I like Toby and Tom's portrayal just as much but Andrew plays the best spiderman in my opinion. Andrew does well as spiderman but I feel as though Toby might be the best Peter Parker.
Bro broke the universe
The professor has arrived!
The travel makes this scene hilarious.
he is too strong peter parker
They really missed with this version of Spider-Man. Fun action and good characters but not Spider-Man.
"Jesus, Parker, you are a freak"
Slay!
"Oop, traveling"
"Wow. I didn't even realize how goofy this movie was lol
Cringe factor 8/10"
I thought it was going to be Barry Allen vs Peter Parker.
personally find the girl with the glasses cute...
Traveling!
"Andrew was a great Spider-Man, but too damn good looking to be a realistic Peter."
Come on just take it
Azucar
Since when did spider man become such a douche bag? This is the worst version of him.
This movie is more like a teenage romance  than a superhero movie
Bruutall!
Omad
"Anyway, is that Ursula?"
This FPS cured my cancer
travel.
Flash is the victim here. That bitch is a real bitch.
"I mean, the whole thing is the girls fault for doing art in a sports hall. Wrong place baby, move your shit."
Still wondering how he did that on purpose...
I call traveling
Worst spiderman ever.
That eas definitely travelling
Parker you freak. Bests Spider man !
Lol... The girl wasn't supposed to paint there anyway. They always start fights.
"Why does the video look so weird, and how does it look so weird?"
she was so wrong it wasnt on purpose

What soap opera is this scene from?
Can't Hollywood find actual teenagers to play teenagers instead of getting a bunch of 20-somethings to play them.... Geesh...
bruh y is she painting on a basketball court
traveling
"The writing for this scene exposes the issue with forcefully constructing a scene for high-end events to happen. As many mention, people don't paint on a basketball court during a match. It's not the girl's fault, but the direction of this scene. 

They tried to make Spider-Man cool and confident, which I think should be explored more in 2020's Spider-Man version, to illicit the perils of power."
0:24
"WHY is she painting in the GYM right next to guys playing freakin basketball? Entitled female, typical. Can go literally anywhere else, but you chose a gym? Not a library? Not an empty hallway. A gym. The nerve to complain about a basketball when in a GYM. A place well known for painting."
Peter was traveling. He's horrible at basketball.
"L he traveled, doesn't count"
WTF? 222M VIEWS HAHAHAHA
.!.
Hey how can i watch this movie can you tell me
Jesus Parker you're a freak
"I must say that this particular plot is just stupid and naive ! What would you expect to happen when you put a bucket of wet paint inside a basketball court in which a game is in progress ?!? The player hit your bucket just by accident! The Spider-Man was extremely naive and shallow to show off like that, and, the worst, to create an enemy!! !!"
He enjoyed his role in bringing down Flash. This scene displayed his mild heroic side blended with some good ol' fun.  Excellent scene!
Shitty ass spiders can't move a feather without spidy shit
How does this have over 200 million views
Shaq be like
....oops
tudo isso para impressionar a menina mais feia da escola
No one realizes how high and far he jumped
"in reality doing it on purpose wouldve gotten Flash layed while the nice guy, Parker, wouldve...walked away."
Flash looks like Anthony from Alexander and the terrible horrible no good very bad Day.
"0:30 That girl is Missy Kellenback, and yes she canonically does have a crush on Peter Parker."
"""he never ballin"""
That must have costs more than his aunt's salary...
so great ....
Nice pandas parker
That wasn't a travel it was a damn journey
cena fraca e infantil
Spider msn azomh cub of costest of speed gaming interest of good hamdling of good hollyeood blockbaster of life films
''Travel''
The amount of jump cuts in this makes me sick
Travel ball
No one talks about how insane of a dunk that wouldve been. That shit would have been the greatest dunk of all time. goated
Travelling!
"A movie for teenagers, basically."
(1:49) Why NBA Jam exists
No one will ever in my life convince me that these are the worst Spider-Man movies. They are a cinematic masterpiece with brilliant goldclass-actors.
Travel.
It's really safe too say that was a foul lol travel and collision
Double dribble
You want to become this actor action be positive don't waste your sparm its most powerfull weapon
Peter is just like shaq in his prime
"""And I took that personal"""
"We all talking about how she shouldn't be painting on the court, but why is NOBODY noticing peter did a travel and a half, a foul, and an excessive rim-hold in the span of 3.25 seconds??"
Flash purposely knocked over the bucket and bullies everyone
Flash is a dickhead
That was a travel
I should have done this to my Flash.
1:58
HERYYYTJHHHTJRHH
Lmao this scene was filmed at my school
This actor was superb in Hacksaw Ridge
1:49 Shaq: hold my beer
I would pay to see this spiderman fight THE Flash
The 60FPS makes this scene feel so weird
Hindi movie
so glad I haven't watched all these dumb reboots
TRAVEL TRAVEL TRAVEL
Bro that was traveling on top of a charge
Am I the only one thinking that Missy is cute or not?
"Last time at a basketball court a basketball hit a person playing soccer, he threw the basketball right back at the basketball player's face. What a poorly raised child. He shouldn't even be playing a concurrent game of soccer at a basketball court, especially when there was a basketball game ongoing."
Uhhhh travel
I thought Fabio Cannavaro played Flash in the movie
"I love the new flash character -- short, chonky, mexican guy"
To be honest even though it was scripted that layup was so fake that it was just asking to get sent to the shadow realm.
Yo viendo las vistas
So no one's gonna talk about how the first guy tried to shoot the ball like that?
Someone told me that the girl painting was Mary Jane. Is this true?
Travel or not
She is cute
if you get goosebumps watching this scene you were probably bullied as a child.
Peter Parker Vs Justin Bieber
"Peter: A guy who has superhuman strength and incredibly fast reflexes.

Everyone else: Yeah, tat's normal. Not like he's Spider-Man or anything.

Also Peter: Spider-Man."
The gym is WAY to quiet for how badass that was. I would be losing it
The Professor did it better
Ty uy
1:53 shattering that thing .. . .
What is with the framerate? Ruined cometely.
Scp ppl
we not gonna talk about that travel Peter did
"BTW, if you watch the movie with subtitles (or closed captions), the principal says ""Peter's behavior is just completely unacceptable""
Here's what I hate about that: I guess holding a kid upside down and shoving his face in his lunch is totally fine. Then when someone tries to help said kid, punching and kicking that person is okay too.
Honestly, sometimes it's like the faculty at schools use selective perception. Flash bullied Peter EVERY DAY, usually with physical violence and no one says anything. Then the ONE TIME Peter bullies Flash just by embarrassing him (no physical harm), Peter gets in trouble. Absolutely ridiculous.
Long story short:
Flash bruises Peter's face, the principal doesn't care.
Peter bruises Flash's ego, he gets in trouble."
Peters wearing dunks
Spider man
My boy is using exploits
I know its not the point but as a basketball player this hurts
i really appreciate peter for helping to pick the bucket
66666666666666
Bro got the pandas on
"While this is a nice scene, there are a few things I want to point out:

First of, Flash was actually in the right here - She made that while this guys were playing basketball AND it was an accident! What did she expect?! Of course something like that ccan happen - Why did she do that even there in the first place?

Second... if I remember the movie correctly, Peter was punished for doing this.
I mean... yes, it was damage property, but everyone can confirm it was an accident. Sign him up to an actual Basketball Team!
I mean Flash recognized his skills there, his reaction should be ""Want to play for us?""
Which actually would be an interesting storyline - Remember the show Smallville, where Clark thought ""I join up the Football team?""
It was an interesting idea.

So...
I am not a big fan of this movie, it has a lot of problems.

BUT I dare to say while I prefer Tobey Maguire Andrew Garfield wasn't that bad.
But Garfield felt more like an already fleshed out Spider-Man, not the dorky bullied teenager from the beginning. Tobey gave that feeling better, while Garfield felt more like later in the comics when he was out of school, already self-confident as Spider-Man AND Peter Parker (where even Flash was kinda ok) fighting the bigger guys."
POV: you came here after seeing the behind the scenes.
They used the superman music
O my god this movie sucks ass.
Awesome.
Foul and travel?
"Charging, traveling, and unsportsmanlike conduct all in one go. Good thing Peter never had an interest in playing basketball."
Lol Bball coach like um so Peter didn't know you could dunk from the free throw line. Parker like yea I'm done fighting crime I'm gonna go to the NBA lol.
This is like a cw clip
I hate when that happens
Full movie link kaha milegi?
"I think it was Peter #3's dislike for bullied that let him to act this way, it seems as if he's been wanting to do this for a long time"
name of girl.?
"> doing your shi on a basketball court when a match is happening
> Paint get hit by a basketball
> Blames other people"
Flash looks like a rapist to be honest
awh I was hoping to see the scarlet speedster
"1st Flash was way taller than Peter
2nd Flash nearly the same size as Peter 
3rd Flash is smaller than Peter"
The cheerleader whose gum popped after she saw the backboard shatter from what Peter did is visually showing her thoughts about him in that scene. Obviously she's thinking about him popping HER. And yes I mean sex.
"I wonder who that spiderman could be? Surely it cant be that slim guy standing up for someone, demonstrating fast reflexes, sticky hands, and who is able to jump like that. No way."
"Huh its not even Flash's fault, why is she painting in the middle of the court?"
That is unironically the worst layup I've ever seen in my life
If I was in flash's place I would tear her painting apart to not fu**ing painting in a basketball court again!!
Spoiled you money dunkers
What nonsense where is exact cinematography
This is porn for the fat Antifa commie nerds.
Sd e
Her name?
Spidey be ballin'
We want amazing spider man 3 with Andrew Garfield
"Almost a quarter billion views, Jesus..."

damn my dude travelled to fucking egypt before that dunk
"that dude's a dick but it's not his fault... it's a gym, not a studio. that gal should have done her business elsewhere"
really poor story writing
it loooks soooooo baaaaad
"Man, 60 FPS motion pictures should not be a thing."
Andrew Garfield Vs Chris Zylka
i will like to be you asome
nice power
Playing basketball in basketball court is the purpose but painting is not.
this flash would've been the perfect actor for Agent Venom
Juss one moe
The girl on glasses is smoking hot!!
peter jumped literaylly 12 feet n the air... ppl act like its normal.. ok gotcha
So weird watching this at 60fps
"Step 1: be bullied
Step 2: get magical super powers
Step 3: become bully
Step 4: profit?"
"Damn, Parker traveled the fuck out of that though lol"
Am I the only one who loves that Peter just trolls Flash in this scene?
Very nice this scene Peter vs Flash
Actually pretty cool scene
1:04
what  kind of lay up was that ? Dude stopped short of the basket by 2 feet.
Possible travel...
"""you did that on purpose"" said the girl that is painting literally on a basketball court."
"You are amazing
You are amazing
You are amazing"

"still don't know how flash did ""it"" on purpose"
Am I the only one upset that he travelled?
0:26 The smoothest marvel scene
gfff
"If you want it then you'll have to take it 
- vergil parker"
The girl is at fault here for painting on the court while a game is going on. And Peter is just being a jerk. Or am I missing something?
what a stupid scene from a stupid movie
after this what happen ? why ben uncle was in pete college ? i saw this film about 4 yrs ago anybody tell me
Sry but this is stupid compared to peter parker
Travel...
Amo este peter parker
Old backboards. This is why the education system needs more funding.
"These are paid actors, none of this is real!"

The 60 FPS looks so bad. Like I am watching an old time TV play.

"Say what you will about Andrew, but when was the last time you've seen Tobey or Tom ballin?"
"Bro, this is not woithjing the rules of the game how unrealistict!"
Thats charge.
kinda crazy that he wasnt called for a charge on that play. clearly an offensive foul
And no one figured out he was spiderman...
It's time  to diversify your source of income.passive income is the best decision anyone can make. I invested in crypto and it's been the best decision ever.What really guarantees financial security is Diversifying your source of wealth.
"How dumb is this bitch to not only be painting RIGHT NEXT TO a game of basketball, but to think he did it on purpose... Christ these movies sucked"

This is so clear till the fact that it looks like a high resolution video game.
I did the same in high school...but the opposite.
"He could have at least dribbled the ball, instead of running through Flash like a running back."
No one else talking about bro's attempted layup at the start?
Andrew's Peter got to mess with folk I love it
Travel charge hahha
Why the fuck is she painting on a basketball court and then acts surprised when a basketball interrupts her on a basketball court
How does that look soo clean
"As a D1 basketball player, he couldnt have blocked a shot and directed the ball intentionally to the bucket.  Not even Mutumbo couldnt do that.  Why is she screaming like Karen anyways when she is the one painting crap in the middle of the gym."
People in movies are stupid
Shaq: That's all you got?
Imagine if he became a famous athlete bruh immediatley GET HIM INTO THE DRAFTS
That basketball shot was so good that I can not say anything bro
He is better then the another
Hi
He should play agent venom
Winning an unfair fight against a weaker opponent....doesn't show him in a very positive way.

Nothing beats the Peter vs Flash scene from Spider-Man(2002).
Why do they always make them out of glass?!

Who tf paints during a basketball game
https://youtu.be/SudhNi0LmQk
Peter was actually just being a jerk
Flash did nothing wrong in this scene. She was stupid for painting in the gym floor
This was shot in that annoying high frame rate format..
Small thing but best version of Flash Thompson in all three spiderman franchises. The guy feels like a character and not an American Pie extra.
God this is dogshit.
"I never really liked him as Spiderman, I like him as an actor, just not in that role."
spiderman will never be ballin

I seen that as Meltdown science high school
A moment of silence for flash who was only a bit rude but otherwise did nothing wrong.
1:48 travel
Super
Flash is kind of skinny
"When ever I hear .. yo flash take it 

In my mind he transforms into Speedster flash from (JL) 
And kicks Peter ass 
All hail speedforce"
why tf was she painting next to a basketball game?? flash wasn't in the wrong here lol
he will never ball
1:49 bro really trucked him like he was in football
I really did like this casting of Flash so much better than the original.
Movie name
Oh just to remind everyone about the plot a giant Lizard guy wanted to turn everyone into Lizards for reasons. It also had this scene Peter was literally being the bully here
Title is a trap
Holy after all this time just realized he's wearing dunks
Honestly I don't know why people like TASM Peter. Like you might as well call him David Dowry instead of Peter Parker because he's just not the same character.
Tobey is a better acter
"Yup, Tobey Maguire is my favorite"
Just now realizing he has dunks on
"Boy become A Human with Inset-Powers

Did nobody notice how far he traveled tho i mean come on
Travel!!!!
You can become cool by training hard or you can just be bitten by a radioactive spider.
"He's not like the Flash at all... some would say, he's the reverse"
"This is quite possibly the most basic, idiotic scene in movie history when put in context of how much money was invested to make this nth version of Spider-Man. Just straight terrible. The fact that teenagers, and some adults, like this movie explains everything you need to know about why the masses are so easy to manipulate."

Travel and offensive foul
I love how they really do not look like high schoolers...
Op
Fuck the others! HE was the best Spiderman. Not a total dork like Tobey and not annoying and like Holland

"Garfield was the best Spiderman, perfectly nailed Peter's complicated nature in this scene."
"IN RESTAURANT:

Travel violation.
Keren habis
That position Andrew get's into (almost horizontal) when he's in the air and just about to dunk the ball is schexy as hell!
the very existence of this scene is humiliation
"What retard uploaded this in 60fps? Awful, awful, awful."
Flash threatened a young girl to watch her back in front of everyone and nobody said anything
This is great if you are a 7 year old
"Has anyone heard of ""travelling"""
ultra instinct in the dunks
this was so cringey
Who else here because of the BTS?
1:54 bad ending
"How has this been viewed 218 million times, this scene is retarded.  Nerdy girl is painting something several feet away from where the guys are practicing, then gets outraged when a loose ball knocks over her paint... how about don't paint directly beside an active practice?  Peter Parker is trying to show up flash in basketball, but then proceeds to not execute one basketball move.  He plays keep-away for a few moments before football tackling his way toward the net, and long jumping to a broken rim.  Retarded.  Completely retarded."

"What on earth does TopMovieClips do to the clips of movies that they have on their channel that makes them all look like higher-quality soap operas? It seriously messes with my brain to have the cinematography so screwy, and I can't figure out why it hurts my head."
mais o parker num tem zoio azul
What a travel
This clip being at 60 FPS is really triggering me. The after image is so hard to just ignore
Why she was drawing at that area though lol
Only andrew garfield
"Peter not even scored, because of traveling, he makes 7 steps, 3 are allowed^^"
This might be the dumbest thing I've seen in my entire life
Kinda her fault for painting on the court right? Lack of insight from her. Flash in the right
"I am new to cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, but I am very interested and curious to start investing in it, although I do feel this is kind of late now. Can anyone tell me what I need to do?"
If this was in the NBA he would never gotten away with this 1:48

All these years later and I still wonder why flash was proud of the worlds easiest block. 0:06
Andrew's young face makes me wanna choose him as the best Spiderman
Why is she painting at the side of a basketball field?
travel...
"M-m... Dude, Flash is not here."
amazing
"I still wonder what's inside the script writer's and director's heads when they made this scene. None of it makes sense.

Others have pointed it out before, but why the heck people here would practice cheerleading, basketball, and paint at the same place? That travelling and the backboard smash, and there's the entire room of witness of Peter jumping meters high and long."
We engage in a small amount of mischievery

Beautiful movie

"John 3:16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.

God loves you! Jesus loves you! Start believing in Christ today! Have faith that he will help you to change from your old, sinful ways. Have faith  that Jesus will take care of your present and future! Repent of your sins today as well!"
"1:50. This is giving me ""NBA"" vibes."
paso 0
NOW THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL SLAM DUNK!!
Bonito
What is Peter doing in the basket ball court?
"Sure, the scene is funny because Peter shows him up. But honestly, his behavior is not really good. 
If the roles were reversed and Thomson would show Peter up like that (before he got his powers), we wouldn't find it remotely funny."
Fun fact : Flash sometimes has hair and sometimes goes bald
All in all i love this scene
I wonder why there is no scene that anybody recruit Parker to basketball team
"Peter dunks and breaks the rim, then runs out the doors.

Flash: Guys, I lost him"
Is that lebron james
The cable guy
Omg I love Spider-Man
Once I saw this I knew Toby Maguire was the better Spider-Man
"It's almost like he can't let go of the  ball


P.S. it's a joke I know he has sticky hands"
Music is lame
Dude traveled more than LeBron James

Peak cringe has been archived
It shows that Peter wasn't always a good guy he also misused his powers sometimes and didn't knew how to handle it at first and this movie also shows how this whole spiderman journey of his started as personal vendetta but then he realized and started helping people for good! This is the best movie to watch 'Peter Parker' and get to know him that he's just a guy next door but with superpowers!
travel???????????????
The real flash
I felt heartbroken when Bert got c kicked
0:27 he caught that without looking
Hhiigryhgrgfiolfhlkkkpmb
Way to go Peterman!
"Fault ,Travel , Peter Parker"
Why do people not want to be in a relationship with him after that
So nobody peep the dunks Peter got
"I thought Flash is a Football Player, not a Basketball Player."
Travelling tho
Like
I think the girl with the bubble gum is supposed to be Liz
The fact that this SCENE along has 215 mill shows how underrated this film was loved Andrew as spidey
good
Hes travelling
I'm just confused as to why the back of that basketball hoop was made of glass.
*Flash was getting bullied in MARVEL*
"excuse me ,, where is the flash?"
https://youtu.be/oqrWNueIJpc
POV: your first time reading the comments section despite watching this video multiple times.
This man had dunk like lebron bruh
Amazing
He is in big trouble
the time when Peter was faster than Flash
Dude at 0:07 legit went up for the softest layup in human history. No wonder Flash looks so good; his teammates are ass
He actually need TASM 3
That is so great
"Win video
comments: good 80%
Bad comments: 60%"
"worst scene, in a not particularly good movie."
Also that stupid bitch shouldn't be panting shit in the gym when people are playing with their balls.
That's a stupid fucking scene. No wonder this version of Spiderman got canceled. Fucking director was stupid.
cool
Is this frame interpolated? It looks really weird to me.
Massive travel LeChina James style
Uhhhhhhh flash look like a ridiculous idiot now ...sorry flash
Spiderman real
Spider also had Shaq's powers
Goods
This feels like a CW TV series
Well that scene was totally realistic.
He didn't even dribble while running...
lame
Even I have saifertol react
Why 60fps? That soap opera look is really disconcerting.
I wonder which one of the two is the biggest douche. I think i'd rather befriend flash.
