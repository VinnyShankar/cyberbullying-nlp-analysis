"This video has an 'American Sign Language' translation, and 90% of the time, it just says 'hands'."
the captions are in almost every language except the one the song is sung in-
Its 2023 and t-series still has no comeback for this
Semalam bobo dimana
"Recuerdo que vivi esta pelea entre Tseries y Pewdiepie por el puesto #1, hubo muchos youtubers apoyando a Pewdiepie pero aun asi en India la poblacion es grande y Tseries crecio bastante superandolo. De hecho, esta ""pelea"" seria como algo historico en esto de youtube."

T series be weeping
Bro m the real supporter of pewdiepie but sad for his loss and his channel is dead too much upset
Can someone explain the Holy Spirit dog sweater?
Yep.
Wait... why the name of this music is from Poland...
"I sense another war, but this time its MrBeast.."
this is so unfunny why did i like this??
Anyone here in 2028?
It'd be funny if his son reacted to this 15 years from now
"Still weird to think this was 4 years ago
Truly the best war on here"
The best music ever I listened
4 years later still goated
i like all of the bitc* lasagnas
t series vs mrbeast
2023???
"Damn, I remember the time when this song dropped. 
Silly internet drama and I just entered high school. This was the biggest thing of my life. 
Now 4 years later, I'm preparing to enter university and I'm still here listening to this. Thank you Felix <3"
bbitch lasagna

As a Filipino I want pewdipie to watch Filipino soap operas and dramas and diss it
Probably the most legendary YouTube video by a YouTuber
5 years later
Almost 5 Years ago

Boa tarde!
Nostalgia :(
bitch lasanga

I HATE T SERIES
my childhood
T series having more than half of his subs
Good
Pewdiepies first subscriber must feel like the king of the world
one day i can proudly tell my grand kids i was part of the greatest internet war
4 years later this song is still fire
MrBeast feels that he is very suitable to race to subscribe to T-Series instead of PewDiePie :)
I wonder why this comment will get likes
