that was priceless
Courtney Cox used to be the hottest one but she went and jacked her face all up
Jennifer Anniston never striked me as a funny lad.. she tries but that's definitely not her forte..  she's good at being a crybaby and pretending she still looks 23
all 3 of them were so bummed out
"for people who been wondering if jen was annoyed or just acting, she definitely seems already uncomfortable with everything at the beginning. before the show starts they have always breakdowns the whole things (maybe just some of them) with the guest, and there's a chance jen forced to do it anyway. the script was totally ridiculous and inappropriate, the jokes wasn't funny, and it's contrast of each characters personality. jen is not wrong for hating it. these just ruined the character"
Rumspringer with stifflers mon
Is stifflers mom there
Hey weirdo
Signing the contract is completely against everything we built
I don't sighn contracts and neither does she
Could someone pls tell me who he called to get the friends apartment replica pls
The dialogues are really bad
"Jennifer must be acting ""annoyed"", otherwise she would have never agreed to this beforehand. And yes, they knew, what was gonna come."
It's natural for women to have closer bonds than men. These three women have so many memories with each other and they seem like they all genuinely care for one another.
Good times.
joey wrote the lines
The fact that the kitchen looks so real like in friends except for the cookie jar that's red
Why am I feeling uncomfortable to see this? I mean I love some FRIENDS rcast have eunion in this but
Omg ..can't believe some people..she was NOT pissed. Nor did she hate it..she's ACTING...hellooooooo because all Jimmy aka Ross was talking about making love through the whole reading...
Courtney is so beautiful !!
The onley thing Jennifer needs to run tords is a mud pit wresling match with Carey from the TV show the king of weens
Jenifer is amazing
That set is amazing
Jennifer seems uncomfortable since the wig  came out I guess.
"Lisa literally: hey!!

Audience: bwahhaa haa ha ha...."
I think Jennifer really hated this.
4:33 The audience thinks they are going to witness a full reunion. Hence the excitement.
Whys Jennifer being such a btch
"Sad they left, ""The handsome man was about to enter""."
The original show was so cringe and stiff but this dialogue they did really made it more interesting.
Lmao he killed it as Ross
That kinda sucked even if it was supposed to be funny
Thank god he was not the writer of the show! It was embarrassing.
Kimmel was mean to them. Especially to Jennifer.
i used to like her.. she is arrogant damnnn
Happy birthday courney from italian boy live in rome and I m fan of friends
"Not funny at all!! Which is why all 11k comments have been hidden, poor Jimmy!"
.
jen was so over this LMAO
Jennifer could have been a bit more cooperative instead of behaving like a b*tch
jen un po scazzata AHAH
Thanks to the creators and actors of the series friends! You have been and remain true friends to me!
seems like jennifer want to tear that script apart and leave
Clearly Jennifer didn't like any moment of it lolx
This is the MOST STUPID THING i've seen on tv and that was the MOST STUPID HOST!!!
I feel uncomfortable watching this
So stupid
"If Janice enter the room saying ""Oh My God"", daaaang, that'd be the best."
The host (tho I don't know his name) is really trying
"lmao, the first thing I tought when the curtains opened, was ""how much money that portion of the set cost him?"" then he replied, 80 thousand! Hahaha"
I think Jennifer hates the show now bc it reminds her when she was a complete smoke show and now she's old.   Those were her glory days and that's all people want to talk about.
"Lisa seems to be the only one who didn't have botox. She aged so well, despite the other two."
I think deep down in the scenes where it's just Jennifer and Courtney when they were talking about kissing I think he was trying to talk them into kissing him that's why I think that whole setup was about his own way of getting his chance to kiss Courtney and Jennifer.
Why are talk show hosts creepy flirtatious with Jennifer Aniston??
Lisa is always the best
I love how they not closing the door but the whole wall
2014 it's old
this feels like Joey made skript
the only good talkshow is hosted by graham norton
I love seeing this reunion.
Damn jenn was so uncomfortable
Jimmy is the biggest dork lol
Tris woman si so cuteeeeeeedeeeee
Sleazy pish
no... not every detail .... sorry for the 80k   its not right
Is it sad that 1 of the friends died years after this came out
"Why this TV show host make us not comfortable either , thank God he wasn't one the producers or F.R.E.I.N.D.S will get fuxxx"
I have a high school friend who *always* gets mistaken for Jennifer Aniston.
Idk i don't find jimmy Kimmel funny at all unlike jimmy fellon
Even the thumbnail is showing how uncomfortable they are
Anyways Stan James Corden and his GOOD reunion
I can't tell if they're all genuinely playing the part or they just hate Jimmy Kimmel
Rachel is very arrogant.i would replace her with any one else (don't judge me))
Why do I feel embarassed to watch this?
Jimmy was funny once
"I guess, Jen was uncomfortable because of the script. (It's all about making love tho) Not sure if it is a part of acting or she's really pissed that time.
Still, I love f.r.i.e.n.d.s!"
How much did you get paid for ya tweet Jen?
this is insulting. Jennifer reactions tell
Monica will be mad
So cringe even jennifer was very umcomfortable
WHAT A STUPID EPISODE
All 3 of them are still in such amazing shspe
Came to see Rachel Monica and Phoebe. But Kimmel managed to pour cold water on what could have been a great crackling interaction. What a disappointment.
Hahaha looking back at this clip and makes me think that Jennifer has no idea that there will be FRIENDS reunion in 2021....... it also made me realize when I watched this my past me had no idea there will be FRIENDS reunion....
"This is the worst thing I've ever seen. And with the cast of ""FRIENDS"" for crying out loud... I hate Jimmy"
i hate this guy
this is not funny
Plastic surgery was the worst invention
Happy birthday at courtney cox from italian boy live in rome
you suck
Only a late night host could waste the talent of those three women on a stupid sketch like that
Jimmy is the best FRIENDS cast ever.
damn this made me so uncomfortable
"Man, this is so cringy"
Who said friends reunion hapnd ystrday..
Thank you Jimmy for doing this. This is the closest we got to seeing the characters come back to life.
Jen Aniston looks soo young there.
Cringe
Jimmy ruined it with the script.....and Jen is so uncomfortable....she's totally not enjoying this.
I laughed so hard when Jennifer asked Him and said u invited Courteney here?
This is so TRULY disgusting.
Wtf is this
Anyone here after friends reunious teaser ????
"What the hell was this,"
"The nosy gym revealingly correct because show gully fill aboard a somber tanzania. imperfect, melted sunflower"
The cheering of crowd says how cool Friends is
Jimmy really sucked at acting out Ross and writing him like I could just see how David Schwimmer would act in this situation and how it would have been written this is such a disservice to the cast and the show
I don't get how anyone finds this guy funny. Maybe it's his terrible delivery but the whole thing came off so creepy. The only thing I can think of is that it's meant to be a parody of most fan fiction being sexual but it's just oof
WHOS HERE AFTER THEIR REUNION TRAILER CAME OUT?! SEE YALL ON 27TH PEOPLE
This is creepy
Guys may 27 friends reunion premiering don't miss it...and check out the trailer released by HBO two days before
Could that BE more cringeworthy?
"Could Jennifer Aniston ""BE Anymore Of A B*tch"" About this.. Ugh.! I was Annoyed by HER AZZ being Annoyed."
goddddd she is so cute! JEN ILY BABE
Rachel is uncomfortable. Nobody see?
that's the terrible  thing  they did
I dont know if jen looks pissed or helluva uncomfortable and seeing this makes me happy I love it but also I want to cringe
This was ingenious
We have a teacher in my school who looks the exact same as Jennifer
who else wishes this said 1 day ago
As much I love FRIENDS same i hate this ..
He should have made another script that's actualy funny and not disgusting. They all seem so uncomfortable and he's the only one enjoying it. This isn't funny it's insulting and he ruined Friends. Disgusting
"Kimmel is supposed to be funny? If he was going for cringe, that was spot on."
Where could I found this full episode?
I still watch Friends on Netflix...but I don't tell anyone....oops
lhlhkhlkhkhhk
4:20 that was so uncomfortable
"This is a Friends reference. She's not pissed, it's part of Rachel's overall reaction when Joey wrote a script like that."
Why is RACHEL hating it
Jimmy you could've done better
It was a bit corny but it could have been funnier if Aniston hadn't been so stuck up.
"The stimulating pan cosmetically arrive because step-son predominantly search from a  five sunday. cooing, erect meal"
this is just so uncomfortable to watch lol you can see mostly by jen's expression how pissed she is that she was dragged into that and even dragged court and lisa into it
It looks like Jennifer  do it with a big smile and friendly behavior when she charge millions when is below millions she do it against her will.....
This was a nice set up. So funny.
Rachel Green looks great..
*CRINGE INCREASED TO 100*
Why do I hate this ep?
Such a waste. Conan's version would be better
Jeniffer is so ruddddeeeeeeeee
"this is so cringey really aagh.
but isn't it all supposed to be scripted? like jen, lisa and courtney were told about this right?"
why is Jen so pissed?????????
it feels like Jennifer really got pissed.
I never realised that Jen wears such incredibly high heels.
"Every time I finish watching Friends again, the loneliness is so real."
"Anybody notice that Jennifer is the only one who looks the same as in the show
This is ent a hate comment there all SO SO pretty!"
This is horrible. You can see how insulted Jennifer felt and it clearly showed on her face.
2021 and still watching this for god sake please give us a reunion special..or a movie plzzzzzzz
this is the crew you gathered and you decide to do 5th grade jokes jimmy???? such a waste im cryingggggggg
This does not seem funny at all
Jenni lov lov
This is terrible! terrible!
"omg this not  funny lol, and like monica and ross's relationship is not at all a romantic relationship, its a very lovable, sibling relationship. it just ruined the vibe"
meanwhile david shwimmer : I'm fine...
Im just crying a lot!! Gagahaha
"Dude, don't ever say that Joey and Chandler are no more. They are alive in our hearts."
Courtney looks so uncomfy
"There are two scenarios here, 

Number 1: Jen is annoyed and was so upset that she didn't act like she was supposed to and she just wanted to get through it.

the big question here: why the hell did she stay there and do it to the end!! couldn't she just say wait a minute this isn't appropriate I'm out of here!!!! (some will say she didn't want to ruin the show .... it's also a possibility)

Second scenario: she really acted and was so good that she even make us think she did it perfectly. 

The question here: was it really funny? wasn't there any other script that could have been funnier !!!"
"It's not the exact replica.  Where is the jar with ""pickles"" written on it?"
Brought a smile to my face. Friends should always be Friends no matter what circumstances that you're going through .
This veryyyy insulting
Why was the wig in the freezer
"Get saved in christ right now before it's too late. Just pray that you believe he died for your sins and that he is your Lord and savior then tell him to enter your life. when you say this, that dead spirit in you comes alive, you're born again, soul is saved from hell, name written in the book of life. after that get to know God. repent and trust in God. serve God, you will be rewarded."
I look at their faces and they seem to be tired of being remembered as those who acted in friends.
Why does jennifer aniston hate everything that has to do with friends ..
i think everybody noticed how uncomfortable he made her feel
Even if Jennifer is a huge star but she should remember if it wasn't for friends she wouldn't be where she is... just sayin
*Lisa Kudrow deserved that noise from the audience*
Feels like a missee opportunity to attach this video togegher with my Spec script for Normal people to show a perspective how insanely better I can be in writing than script for Friends!
Who da fuk is this guy?
"When she threw that wig away
Me: :0"
i feel so bad for these friends actors. Everyone just wanna keep talking about 1994-2004. Only Jennifer Aniston is still extremely well known outside of friends
He said every thing is same....but the knob opens the refrigerator is diff
"7 years have passed since, and it is as cringy as ever"
"The cast of friends could cure cancer, run for president, solve climate change and achieve global peace, but probably still be asked about that show only"
What the f is this
"Jennifer acts so annoyed, but that is the show that made her famous. Just go with it!"
I hate Jimmy
"Ok idk why, Lisa was shaking reading the script and literally struggling to talk"
"jen is all like; 

NOT THAT RACHEL THING AGAIN"
He probably thought this was soo funny.
Jen is such a good actress. I actually started to think she hated it
you have found an indian fan that u were finding for
"That was not fun, not smart, it has no point, it had nothing but stupidity.... So... WHY??????????"
"It seems to me that Aniston doesn't take it well! That is not kinda professional! I thought she is more funny! U do the great show back in a days, now what's wrong Jen? This show makes u who u r now, like it or not! And Jimmy work so hard to make the set! Show some respect, put the wig on Jen at list...... Spread your ""boundaries""!"
goddamnit rachel aint happy
"As much as Jen likes Rachel..she definitely hates the fact that people seem to just stick around to that...I remember seeing this interview where she said she really like Rachel and the character but now she wants to leave it behind or something..cause she wants to do other things...she doesn't want ""Jen"" to be Rachel"
Let's appreciate how the crew copied Monica's kitchen.
I feel sad watching in 2021 when Chandler 'mathew Perry' actually is dead
Where is original Ross David Schwimmer ?
LISA/PHOEBE DOESNTT AGEEEEEEE PERIODT
"This was all done on purpose, from how annoyed Jennifer looked to the cringe worthy acting."
"Jen, court en lisa are clearly very uncomfortable, why would you do this? I thought that maybe this would be fun but I hate it. Like why would you make them feel so frustrated? They didn't like it and this makes me very upset."
OMG! teary eyed here!
"Too-many-jokes
Must-mock-Jimmy"
They are acting
Omg seeing Lisa getting this long applause is so overwhelming
"Friends is not a show. It is an emotion.  It is everything. It is the real deal. God! Even the colours of each and every object in the set feel like home.

I am at loss of words."
"When phoebs read the script: ""are we in jeoys imagination"""
one of the most awful things ever seen in my life... poor girls..
35 million views isn't enough.
"Jen is so mad... And rightfully so... It all just seems so disrespectful... Especially the Rachel wig... She hated that haircut... Glad she said I have boundaries...

I don't know if this was actually done or if it was a spoof... Wtf was this?"
The cringe . . . OH THE CRINGE! Hahaha
Monica must weight only 1 pound right here
I solemnly prefer jimmy fallon over jimmy kimmel
I really feel that this ridiculous script that kimmel came up with and unknowingly forcing the three divas to put on show on the spot is just a mild insult for what all they have given on their behalf to the entertainment industry and the fans
I know this was meant to be a fan fiction type of thing... but wtf!??
they never came back.
Did people really find this funny?? So disappointed. These amazing actresses deserve better.
disappointed no chandler or     joey..
"Seems that she was a bit grumpy there, I didn't like here caracter on Friends either"
"have you seen courtney""s face when jimmy said that chandler died...."
"unbelievable that they actually had lisa, courteney AND jennifer there and this is what they decided to do"
Phoebe is the best
Okay but like jennifer looks really irritated with Jimmy . She looks so DONE
Why is Jenn being such a b*****?
"God, I hate these people, especially Aniston.
Kinmel however is great."
Jimmy isn't being Ross.He is the god damn chandler
Courtney Cox lisa kudrow
Jennifer ainston
They forgot the chair cushion
The set replica was pretty awesome
it's a fanfic tho
What a dickhead
"Because of all the comments, they are acting annoyed, they love the show and it's been known many times that that is the case. Sure this video may be cringey, but it is ment to be funny and entertaining. Get it together, stop with the uncultured unnecessary comments, look into things before you comment."
"is it really improvisation? 
do rachell know about monica and phoebe's coming?
rachel looks like she didnt like"
"rachel and phoebe still same.
but... monica more beautiful and hotter"
I think Jennifer Aniston was kind of low key annoyed by this lol
This is a worst scene I have ever seen in this show.
Jen is just so mad xD
"Rachel seemed so uncomfortable in this, actually they all did."
It seems like Jen really felt bad for Courtney and Lisa to be dragged into this senseless drama
WTF is this?
"God damn after all these years Phoebe is phoebe,  Monica is Monica,  Rachel is rachel . Are they bitten by damon or stefan  , just anyone tell me for the love of god. I'm screaming like pheebs now"
Jimmy Kimmel for Forrest Gump. I don't know?!
That's the sweetest thing ever
the worse actor in the friend show was the Jennifer aniston
"Jen's head: ""I make 4 movies a year, but all everyone wants to talk about is the show i did 20 years ago"""
Is it just me or does courteney look a little bit like Dolly Parton
"It should had been more enjoyable if the script was not that ""stupid"" (like Jen described)"
People thinking Jen didn't know about this make me laugh
hilariously brillaint. long live Friends.
The most awkward thing I've seen in a while.
priceless
Was Jennifer rude?
Why she is so upset
cant belive hes doing it in 2014
"Jennifer is so boring omg, I didn't know that"
This made me happy. I just rewatched Friends and it's always a classic.
Very creepy
They felt so uncomfortable
WHY IS JENNIFER ANISTON BEING SO RUDE?!!?
Jen is absolutely hating this
Jennifer is such a good actress I thought she was really annoyed at first.
"This was a Friends reunion we wished for, not the one that we deserved."
I' ll be there for you......you are the boss.
Jimmy Springsteen hahahaha
"This isn't funny at all, Sometimes Jimmy makes the guests uncomfortable"
"Even if it was in there a script to play on comfortable, it doesn't make any sense! why would they gather Monica, Phoebe and Rachel and do this awful thing?"
It doesn't matter if it was scripted for them to play uncomfortable or they were actually uncomfortable. the whole thing was UNCOMFORTABLE!!
"I couldn't imagin that one day I see Rachel, Monica and Phoebe in the FRIENDS kitchen and feel so AWFUL! Jimmy Kimmel made it happen -_-"
Obviously Jennifer doesn't want to do this
Could they *be* anymore uncomfortable?
"this is so cringe
xd"
*Visible disappointment*
"Imagine spending $80,000 on a set for Jennifer Aniston to act like that"
The dumbest human being in the universe! Dear God! He gave me the cringe
They sincerely hate it.
"Not complaining,  but not every detail was replicated. The Cookie Time Jar is different. But that's because the original one was given to Lisa Kudrow by Matthew Perry because of a funny incident."
Thanks for ruining everything.  Jennifer you are horrible
This is disgusting.
"If only he had came up with something that would make a tribute to the series and the comedy genius of Friends, I bet Jen would have seemed more excited.

I JUST CANT BELIEVE HE GOT ALL THE GIRLS AND THIS IS WHAT THEY DO"
This is my fav fav fav YouTube video
Wow pheobe looks the same she is ageless
ALL OF THEM ARE STUNNING OMG
They should have checked the props with Monica fr it's genuineness not Rachel..
I cannot tell if Jen is mad or just being herself. This is why I dislike Jimmy Kimmel. He is rude and makes people uncomfortable.
"Nobody:


Not even Jennifer:



Me:BuT WhY aRe ThErE OnLy TwO ChAiRs!?"
Jimmy Kimmel presents: How to ruin a show in 8 minutes.
This is the weirdest and most awkward friends thing I have watched and EVER want to watch !
"Yeah, nope"
All these girls hated this stupid thing
"Feel like I am watching ""The Room"" again.
""Oh hi Ross"""
she seems so annoyed.
I feel like she genuinely hates it lmao
This flops commedy is actually pathetic. Worst late night host on tv
what the hell is wrong with this guy???????? it just seems like this was a sexual fantasy of him !!!!!    Totally inappropriate!!!!!!!
Hi phoebe
Hi Monica
I love them all so much
I can't seem to find a reason why Jen was always so popular when actually Courteney slayys the same !!???
3 best actresses in the world and still Jimmy and his director managed to flop this all by themselves
Jennifer is so beautiful here
"No offense but I cringed while watching this , I miss the old show cRi"
Am I the only one who heard Jimmy as JACK Ross' Father?
Phoebe is still phoebe
Me: Cringing for 8minutes 9seconds straight.
"7:03 is that scripted? I'm curious, if not, then they're really good in improvising and making a show good. If not then it's fine by me."
2:39 Is that scripted or not? If that's not then that would be the best things he's ever done
"I don't know Jimmy, that's pretty simp, you spent 80 thousand dollars making that? S to the I to the M to the P"
the refrigerator is different
Jennifer looks so pissed off and uncomfortable here. Is it part of the acting or is it how she truly feels? I wonder.
Everybody loves this show
"Lmao people think she's ACTUALLY annoyed, she's acting lol but I'm sure she is annoyed of all the friends stuff in general"
So worth 80 000 dollars
Millionaire stupid = Jimmy
"I wanted Phoebe to flip out and scream like, ""I know you're good at making love, I know you're good at making love..now shut up!!"""
She was clearly very annoyed from the beginning
So uncomfortable.
"I love FRIENDS but jimmy is just plain stupid, creepy, and disrespectful"
"jen was so desconfortable, OMG!"
we all want to see a reunion but not like this
feels more like a disrespect to the legendary characters...
"If I ever had the opportunity to meet Friends cast, I would probably only meet with Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer. 

At least they would be enthusiastic to answer my friends-related questions."
"Jimmy:do you know what a fan fiction is?

Jennifer:no

Me:Jimmy no-"
jennifer is really annoyed and she got a point!!! this script was so stupid
Wow kimmel is a creep
"Could this be anymore ""CRINGY"" ?"
Jen being annoyed is part of the script. Do you guys seriously think they really are not aware of what they are going to do in the show?
absolutely brilliant. Lili
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!!!
THIS IS SO CRINGEY KSKAKS
This is awful
The friends cast are probably sick and tired of only hearing about friends
"It was acting. Everybody knew it was gonna happen, we rehearsed it backstage, it was scripted out. The idea was that I would force Jennifer into this mini Friends reunion, and she pretended to be annoyed by it. - Jimmy Kimmel."
"christ, does Mr. Kimmel know how to joke only about sex? disappointment. such an awesome opportunity and that's what it wasted on."
1:58 Is that lill offensive to give a hair wig to Anniston at the beginning ..!?
lisa kudrow is a total babe
What a stupid idea
Identify theft is not a joke Jim(my). Millions of families suffer every year !!
"80,000 frickiinngg dollars !! Really ?? 
U could have given that to me..jut saying"
Who says Courtney cox looks bad after surgery..   I think she is still pretty
Oh boy Jennifer looks so pissed.
I don't think Jennifer Aniston liked having to do that seen like that hahahahahaha.
*How to ruin the show in 8 minutes*
Is it just me or did Jennifer Aniston always seem uncomfortable or like mad
Americans have the weirdest humour . That jimmy is a idiot
"It was supposed to be funny and it actually was but the way Jennifer and the others were pissed off, makes us really think what the hell was wrong with it? Poor Jimmy"
This is so cringey....
The entire time since when the skit began.. I felt like Jennifer is being so cold.. is it only me or u too felt the same?
"she was not genuinely annoyed or pissed. she is an actress, dumbasses. you bunch of dumbasses."
I though they were acting about this but when i look to the comments i understood they are really hate it
I mean she was right to be rude it was insulting
The embarrassment I got from this I-
"I think that this is a subtle hint being given by them that if an actual reboot of F.R.I.E.N.D.S. was creted, then it would ruin our perfect interpretation of the show that we have as of now because they might  know that a reboot couldn't get half as good as the original show. Still its a delight to know that a reunion episode is happening even if its in the form of an interview."
Jimmy Kimmel had half the cast of FRIENDS and this is what he came up with. Such embarrassment to the cast and the show.
Is there anyone out there that thinks Jimmy Kimmel is funny? I don't get why he has this show.
Friends without Joey and Chandler is cringe.
"Monica and Phoebe are stealing Rachel's ""thunder"" this time."
Huh?
you guys are stupid they are acting annoyed
"I can't believe people really think Jennifer is acting like this for real. She plays along with doing the stupid parts with an annoyed face, this is so obviously a part and every single thing even from before the thing starts is scripted, how can so many people think she's behaving like that for real. Do you think Jimmy's script is actual real fan fiction that he wrote as well? Gosh... 

Make love to yourself Jimmy was also just ""Jennifer being annoyed"", right? Them leaving - too? It was actually intended to do 22 more pages on the Love Making scene?..."
What the hell is wrong with Rachel?
It's so sad to see them like this wtf why am I crying
Great
Did he just made fun of the show??? No wonder Jennifer was pissed
"This was one big stupid idea judging from the 'performances' jimmy spent 80k being humiliated on his OWN show smh, not exactly funny"
Phoebe got the longest screams....
To everyone whining: Jimmy and Jennifer are really good friends in real life.  No way in hell they'd do it if she was uncomfortable.  Put more respect on her acting skills
So happy that Lisa kudrow got that amazing applause.........
Jen Aniston is really really upset here.
damn jennifer is still hot even in 2020
"So staged, this is really boring."
That was fun. Funnier if they had actually tried to play themselves.
May be story will be different if it was Jimmy Fallon or James Corden.
"They all look like they're going to a funeral and Lisa is just like 'who cares, their dead'"
O....M.....G.....
Omg this is so insulting!! It is very painful to watch
Jennifer has behaviour issues & we can clearly see that
Lisa looks like soccer mom phoebe
this isn't even the least bit funny
That was stupid !
"Wow, so many people still think that skits on talk shows aren't pre-planned. They even took a bow at the end, ffs!"
jimmy seems like a fan of ross
I thought they were on a break
horrible
why does jimmy sound like monica's father
not that funny
How you doing
the truth is the only two people from the F.R.I.E.N.D.S CAST that have good relationship is leblanc and lisa i think jennifer secretly hates them all especially david
Phoebe the best
"I know for a fact that she hated her hair on season 1 that's why i think when Jimmy pulled out the Rachel wig, it was a genuine annoyed reaction."
God Jennifer hates it
Jennifer acted very cringe & awkward
Harvey W. Be like. That worked surprisingly good for a long time.
I HAVE NEVER CRINGED SOO MUCH IN MY LIFE.... EVEN JENNIFER WAS UNCOMFORTABLE
"Man, does Jennifer hate any reference to Rachel & Friends"
Disrespectful to the cast and especially to women.
God I hate jimmy
The girls are still yum...
I love that Lisa got the longest sne loudest cheer... Love Phoebe and Joey
"This video title should be called ""jimmy kimmel making the cast of friends uncomfortable for 8 minutes straight"""
"I bet jimmy has this in his house, and he makes his kids play in it."
I think Jennifer Aniston genuinely hates remembering friends
"Why does it look like Jennifer hates to do this, like how she reacted at the wig"
Could this be any real more cast?
Jennifer can hate FRIENDS as much as she wants to but that show put her on the map. It is easy to be so frustrated with all that money from FRIENDS.
yo this was just insulting
This was embarrassing
Omg these women look exactly like the friends characters
Why do I not like Jennifer here
Disgusting
I waited for  joey to crash in for beer...
People changes when they read dialogue it seems like they are not happy
This was sooooo bad. Really really bad.
This was so not satisfying to watch lol I understand Jennifer
80000 worth it
"Jennifer was reluctant about reprising her role as Rachel, as much as Harrison was about Han. She knows how to ""act"" annoyed lol"
Too much of attitude jennifer
I think is an example of how fan fiction sometimes...can be really bad or annoying to the actors when they are asked if they liked it o would play it
"jennifer is totally unconfortable, im sure she hated"
Jen looks very proudy
Is Jennifer joking like was she supposed to do that lol
Where's JOEY
The shittiest thing I have ever seen
So awkward
"I half expected Ross to come in and be like:"" WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING!?"
Why does she look like she hates it
Why is Jennifer annoyed?
Could it be any more embarrasing?
"Am I the only one who thinks that everything was prepared? Jennifer looking annoyed during the whole scene, Courtney and Lisa looking uncomfortable. I mean, I believe they were all acting and in fact they were having a lot of fun!"
why does it always have to be about friends i mean jeniffer is so talented and its always about friends
She literally dosent age
Lisa has aged so well
can we please appreciate how lame this is?
Man they look so uncomfortable
BOTOX!!! LMAO
She really hates it
Jennifer is so offended
Never liked Friends.
Aniston is always breathtaking
U can tell everyone was most excited to see Lisa
Was this supposed to be funny? That was awful!
This seems really NOT GOOD AT ALL ...
"Jennifer is so good, that you cant even tell if she is acting or not"
Jennifer Aniston is the only person who can possibly reject Jimmy Kimmel
"Jimmy barely explained what the instructions for the film were. Jen was so confused, it was so funny!"
y is jen acting so rudeeeee
No no! The handsome man was about to enter.
Jennifer is really rude in this scene.
ruined it
Jen is so depressing
Jimmy missed a clap after the first line of the song 5:58
jeniffer aniston gave me a certain feeling that she was uncomfortable eith jimmy and courteney in that place
Poor Ross.
"I miss the line: ""Hail Satan, Hail Satan..."""
Jimmy is an idiot
Jimmy Kimmel couldn't come up with a better skit than how good Ross is at making love ?
Just goes to show how great of a comedic actress Jennifer is that a lot of people in these comments believe that she was seriously annoyed by this script lmao.
this is so disgusting. they all seem so unconfortable and annoyed
"Whoever said it was disrespectful and Jennifer was annoyed. I wondered it too, but watch it (or skip it) until the end. They were all acting."
Is it just me or is the voice of the picture
That was stupid. What a waste! Jimmy Fallon did a great saved by the bell skit. This was crap!
they are still sooooo beautiful
This is insulting on soooooooo many levels
This was so disrespectful for the cast. You can see Jen really annoyed at jimmy.
Jennifer's reaction was so on point. I love her even more after watching this.
There would be 26 seasons of Friends if they never quit the show..
Who else is watching this in 2020
It seems like Joey would have written this and Chandler would make the jokes
Wow some imbecile threw a rose so close to Lisa Kudro's face
You know  she's an awesome actor when people think jennifer is actually annoyed xD
"Kimmel is such an yeird, awkward nerdy guy. I dont know why he is trying to act like one, as if he isnt already"
the fridge handle is off
Jennifer Aniston is definitely PMS during this.
Whats wrong with jennifer aniston why she hate this alot
*Could she be more annoyed?*
Jimmy Kimmel was nervous there.
this guy is so gross
I just wish they make another season in this age
So damn stupid
"Lol... wait wait wait , the handsome man was about to enter!!!!!!!!!"
First time I'm happy there's a dislike button
What is wrong with jennifer?
ok but jennifer was actually annoyed
U can see Jennifer have some beef
This was when they still looked like themselves enough to make a Friends reunion
well this is painful to watch.....
"It's all about you Jennifer, huh?"
"""A handsome man enters..."""
is it just me or did it seem that rachel was angry to see the other caracters
7:00 This is the saddest part
This was truly hilarious.
Jimmy sucks ass. As always.
Ohww myyyy gooowwwwdd
The is the closest we will ever get to a reunion
"These 3 ladys are still so beauty each of them, the smile if lisa ...."
"Imagine how wild it would've been if Joey and Chandler came storming in after Jimmy read lines ""..and we all make out."""
Rubbish no hate just honesty . Most Americans still have a long way to learn how to make good comedy Jimmy is far from it soooo far.
She is acting like she does not like friends anymore
um I got 80 thousand dollars can someone from the show contact me cause I want this kitchen in my home please
Cringe.
Jennifer Aniston just looks frustrated xD
"Easy score, With the sexual jokes"
Wow jennifer is either a really good actress or she really is pissed off with this....this  was horrible
Rachel is my least favorite friends character. I prefer Chandler
Unethical stupid show
Am i the only one who is not getting what jen is acting like?
"I don't understand how people actually like this guy. He's not funny at all. It's just creepy how he's making Courtney, Jen, and Lisa say that stuff"
I feel like this was a good opportunity to make something good yet it was flushed down the toilet.
"It feels like he completely DISRESPECTED this woman and RUINED their time here. Especially Rachel, she was so UNCOMFORABLE, even I could FEEL it! Not funny, not funny at all...
Edit: People, stop calling me out for saying what I felt about the video. I can't tell whether they're genuinely distressed or just acting, but that was what I thought was happening and that's why I commented. People are allowed to have opinions."
Jennifer is really annoyed by this
Jennifer is annoyed wtf.
Jennifer was awkward
jimmy is the walmart version of james cordan
The one that was painful
Jennifer was pissed off lol
"why would he spend $80,000 for this one segment? they might not even use it anymore after this"
Cringing. So. Hard. (uncomfortable laughter)
Utter stupidity.
Monica was like my husband died!
The script sucks
is it just me who can see how she would be annoyed by this? I mean she does like 4 movies a year but people still only acknowledge her for her work on friends. she's an amazing actress!
Boring
Lisa looked SUPER nervous.
I just watched the last episode like 5 minutes ago and jimmy clearly just ruined the hole thing
Why does it seem like Jennifer hates f.r.i.e.n.d.s
This is cringe
I'm just gonna put it out there - I hecking LOVE Lisa Kudrow
"Where is BRAD PITT
The Jealous dude"
Is Lisa choking up when she walks in?
the reaction of the audience tells  about its popularity
IT'S VALARIE CHERISH!!
This is the stupidest video I've ever watched. All of his dollars for this is wasted
They were all acting
did they ask Jennifer to act like a miserable witch?!?!
This is to good
"She obviously is annoyed, the script is a real bullshit"
JENNIFER ANISTON IS SUCH A SPOILSPORT.
That script is basically the fan fiction of some teenager
Que incomodidad hay en sus caras
"I don't know whether Jen was genuinely annoyed or not but I don't find the content is funny... Plus, Jen was not the only one who seemed to be uncomfortable but Court and Lisa were seemed to feel the same too. This is the first time I get to know this show and I have to say I don't have good impression on it."
"Jen doesn't look surprised to see them, did she know?"
i feel so UNCOMFORTABLE!!!!
"Omg Jennifer seemed so pissed and they could of came up with something better since they had 3 friends cast on it 
Like if u agree"
"without schimmer its nothing, ross was ross."
ahh awkward
she really is not talented
It looks like Joey gave Acting Classes to Rachel
They said Monica got the apartment from her grandmother when she died  and the rent was only $800 a month!
Who is still watching friends in 2020??
"she's incredibly sexy...love how she says ""O God"""
"This is wrong on so many levels. I guess six years ago getting women on your show to only talk about ""love-making"" was totally acceptable."
You ruin friends for me
Phoebe is the real queen tho
Jennifer seems really uncomfortable is this on purpose? Lol
"This is the worst thing I've ever seen. I know it was meant to be funny, but it was really insulting to the cast, the crew, the show itself and even the audience, using a buzzer to make laughs, really? The laugh is meant to be natural from the audience. This was so terrible, I mean the three cast members there seemed pretty uncomfortable. Even though it's a fan fiction, people are going to see this, have respect for the legendary show. At least let some things match with the show. I mean no male characters were there, to say the stupidest thing when asked where they were, to center the conversation around love making, really? Is that all the show was to you? Nothing even matched the characteristics of the characters. Monica would be totally obsessed over the place being perfectly clean, Rachel and Ross would try hardest to be just friends, phoebe would be all jumpy and happy and positive. But no, rather, here they all are, talking about making rounds of love to Ross, including Monica, his sister. Really, nothing here or about any of this was funny. Everything was just plain weird. I mean either JA was acting really well or she was pissed af. I would be pissed if I was a part of the show. This was absurd, annoying, uncomfortable, weird, insulting, disturbing and everything else wrong."
"what a waste, this was BAD"
"3:43 Oh Hi, Monic--(double take)
MONICA?!"
Rachel acted so annoyingly
WOW David Schwimmer must be happy to watch this
I feel like this would've been what Joey's script was about on the episode when Ross made him write a play.
Jennifer is not having it at all
Typical (coughs) JEN
I really hate jenifer and Rachel more now!
They should be happy seeing each other but why are they like they have a tension is it coz they fought
he ruined it
"I wanna be there and meet Jennifer, omg!"
i cant tell if jenn is acc annoyed
"*THAT IS SO DAMN STUPID AND ANNOYING*
How disappointing Jimmy..."
Criiiingy af
Subscribe Me!
She is not annoyed.. She is getting emotional by seeing set and her co actots..
"Very very very bad 
Only good thing about this I now know it will cost me 80k to turn my kitchen into the friend's"
Is she mad or annoyed or idk can someone explain and if she is. why?
Jennifer was not impressed lol
this is so embarrassing and uncomfortable
jennifer aniston beautiful
the script didn't pass the vibe check.
"look at rachel she was really angry at jimmy she even said the ""f"" word
look closely"
DDS!
"Omg Jeniffer hate this situation 
She is so uncomfortable"
4:38 Jen is just in pain lmao
It was cringy
Jen looks very uncomfortable.
The one with the lame acting
It was disgusting
"No puede disimular su enojo! Y la cara de desagrado que pone cuando entra Courtney jajaja. Pobre Jennifer. Pero si, siempre sera Rachel. Hasta el fin de los tiempos. Y Courtney es todo lo contrario! Se ve que ama friends"
DaMn
Why the hell is Jennifer being so rude?!
Sonu@786
"Humor gringo, you wouldn't get it jiji"
Emotional sh*t ...... Seeing Rachel tear up .. after minca then Phoebe enters
Why is Jennifer so annoying here ? Could she BE more uncomfortable ?
Bet Jimmy's a fan of harem anime
*Why is Jen so annoying here lmao*
Shaking hands all the time.
the toblerone bar is missing
wtf was that?
was anyone alse really annoyed when jimmy clapped 4 times but its 5
Honestly the isn't funny
"As much as I looooove friends, I find this video very cringe worthy. It could have been anything else really...anything else!"
Im gonna tell my kids these was charlies Angels
This is so cringe. Daym.
I would appreciate it if you changed your description cause I don't like friends
i love this show
man... its like they can never escape Friends... EVER
Where are the purple walls?!
It's like  the  three isnt enjoying being there.
Sadly this is the closest thing we'll get to a F.R.I.E.N.D.S reunion
why does she feels so annoyed? did she hate her character the whole time? or she just got older?
Aniston was not having it
Plz am an Indian from Kanyakumari last of India I wish I could meet all the stars in friends I had seen nearly 10 times the whole season my one of the wish before I die I need to see them plzzzzzzzz any opportunities for that
"Jen is acting like she was annoying all the time, it was part of this sketch"
Jimmy sucks!
Ccv
this is baaaaad
Cringe compilation
aaaa i love this! He should have made rachel said WE WERE ON A BREAK SORRY ROSS LOL
This is so sad
"ABC: stealing successful shows, that are now irrelevant, from CBS, NBC, and even Fox to be 2nd."
"Terrible! J-Aniston is so unconfortable and Jimmy wrote a scene with them only based in sex? I know Friends have a lot of sex jokes, however, what Jimmy wrote is totally sexual and a huge waste of time for them!
God."
I love friends.  but I don't want them to be unhappy... so uncomfortable...
"I think Jennifer was really annoyed. If she acted, she would have said ""make love to yourself, Ross"", ""not make love to yourself, Jimmy"" at the end I guess"
I really don't see the point why she has to act as if she was annoyed by everything in this scene beacuse this just leaves everyone in mystery if this was just a skit or if this is what jennifer actually is
Lol thats how Aquarius would behave when they feel not liking it for any odd reason . Smelly cat
Ok that was weird comedy
Monica is my favourite like if u agree
Akward af
She looks so uncomfortable
What the fook you think you're doing Jimmy you poonk
Its rude of her to throw the wig away!
"1:21 woo woo woo  buddy, we need Monica to verify that."
Jennifer Hates being compared to rachel
It looks like Jennifer is hating remembering friends
IM WHEEZING AT THE MARCEL BITTTT
Why does Jennifer look so upset is this part of show or is this how she is now a days
"Imagine being able to have, Jennifer, Courteney and Lisa, plus the kitchen from the show and do this crappy reunion. They can do so much more. Of course Jen was just acting annoyed but this was not a good concept."
She's an orange
Did Jimmy have a 4 year old whose never watched friends write the script
"My least favorite episode is ""the one with jimmy kimmel"
I think he went much too far :/ Very primitive sense of humour.
can't tell if shes actually angry or what
The fridge is not the same
"I didn't know Rachel because of Friends, I knew her because of her movies back in 2010."
"""Wait, wait! The handsome man was about to enter!"""
she looks so annoyed-
cringe
This made me so uncomfortable watching this.. Jennifer looks like so pissed..
What's up with Jennifer's attitude? Is she playing her part or she's just genuinely annoyed? Tho if she gets annoyed at Jimmy I can kinda understand her point coz he kinda ruined it.
"You guys didn't get it right, Jennifer doesn't hate the days when she were in Friends or isn't annoying this show in purpose.
She is a very emotional person, and maybe (just my feeling) Ross loved her for real and she couldn't love him back as he did.
Actually, she made me cry in this video, somehow I felt her emotions and respect her refusion"
this is gross
Awkward
That table looks a bit off
Jennifer Lopez very ugly
They all didn't enjoy this at all
"Ok, let's say Jen's annoyed acting really was in the script, but what the hell would be a purpose of it?  To make Friends' fans uncomfortable?  Because, let's face it.. Could this scene BE any more uncomfortable?"
"Oh man.  This is old school cringy Kimmel.

I think this is a wonderful satire of people's constant fanfics and theories about fictional characters, especially the ones that just wind up objectifying the female characters."
Why is Jennifer Aniston so stuck up.
Jennifer is acting people.
This guy is not FUNNY THIS NIGHA IS JUST ANNOYING
Yo kimmel you suck
This looks so Photoshoped lol
I actually thought jen was annoyed lol shes good
Jennifer looks like she had abdominal cramps
Cringy as hell and Jennifer Aniston looks uncomfortable
Aniston looks soooo old here
"I don't remember them ever saying ''friends'' in friends, as in them meaning the group"
It's really bad how annoyed she is. She could've been a bit nicer
"I love when crowds start applauding and cheer in this kind of show. cause it is always a big sign that lights up in front of them written: ""applaud"". that is so boring"
Pheobe's mom looks like Pheobe
Stupid flippen show!
I think she was hate this
Alabama
I think she is just playing Rachel
What a shitty shitty move to make. His friendly personality shines through...
So no one liked working on friends?
Rachel looked pissed .
"If that was David and Jennifer instead of Jimmy and Jennifer, I bet you a thousand bucks that Jennifer would have been in a more cheerful mood... Just sayin'... I really think they should get back together... I'm serious, they have to start a relationship in real life, I've  wanted no other 2 celebrities to be a couple like them, especially because they were each other's love interest in friends. They just have such great chemistry and bond together. Like if you are with me!"
Jen looks so angry
Nice
Youd never know why thousands of people liked it
"kimmel is so not funny, wtf is this sketch"
You ruined my life
"Make Love, what are you a girl?"
Friends fans pray that this gets rebooted!
"I love Friends but you Friends Geeks are like wrestling fans, It's not real, Jennifer was acting like she didn't want to be there. Nerds!"
*The one which should never air*
"I know the joke is that Jimmy's script is bad, but the true script that contains that joke is terrible. It is like a ""Inception"" of bad writing."
I can't tell if Jennifer is playing a part or she genuinely hates it
I was waiting for Janice's Oh mY gOd
Courtney Cox had some major botox.
0/10 not enough Joey
"Kinmel is talentless. Not smart, neither funny. He and fallon are the sign we are getting programmed to become more and more stupid cause it's the only reason how these two guys could host a big show. Don't worry I didn't watch the video just sharing my opinion. When I see these two I just hit dislike and leave. But here a comment and a dislike."
Buebos con la Jenn :v
Whats wrong with the wig? Why Jennifer so agonised by it?
That script dialogue would pass today...
I don't know what to think about this
how are the top comments all being fooled by Aniston??? I mean what?
Jennifer Aniston she his superficial its crazy..And wtf THE BOTOX. I hate it..
Jennifer Aniston she his superficial its crazy..
"none of them have aged at all
*at all*"
Phoebe is like the only one that looks the same Jennifer and courteney changed. A lil bit
Friend.
I mean Ross
Jimmy kimmel sounds like jack monica and chandlers dad
Courtney has had some bad plastic surgery
Jennifer looks so disappointed when Courtney and Phoebe walk in
Tears of joy. Love them
I'm watching friends again and again.i don't know why but I'm addicted to this show.
"jimmy shouldn't have done that, jinnifer was so angry"
they had a single door refrigerator
"Jennifer Aniston seems off, not wanting to be there, and as though she has a chip on her shoulder."
God what did Courteney do to her face... She was so gorgeous ):
what is wrong with him. this is the worst thing I've ever seen. they all looks so uncomfortable.
why is jennifer so arrogant?
She looks soooo pissed.
Jenn is like so annoyed i feel her
I never thought I could hate soemthjngs related to friends bc I'm a HUGE fan. But this.. this hurts. And it's so disappointing. Acting or not. Jimmy you disappointed me. It just made me cringe so hard..
why this is so cringe
"Do the actresses hate each other or something? Because it seemed as if they hated each other. I mean, no hugs, no high-fives, nothing."
Joey and Chandler were the best
"""We were on a breeeeaaaakk!!!"""
omgggg courtney cox is slowly starting to look like michael jackson!!!!!!!
This is the worst thing i've ever seemed
I love Jennifer but her lack of professionalism on this sucks
OMG THIS GUY IS JIMMY KIMMEL???????
Jenifer seemed to angry idk why tho ....
Looks like they're all pissed off n so am I. Jimmy is annoying at times
I think Phoebe got the biggest pop on this.
Aniston what the hell is she doing. Huh
This was just bad and Kimmel was the reason
4:06 SWEET HOME ALABAMA!!!
I was waiting for Jennifer to deck Jimmy in the mouth while she got up and left
can tell Jennifer was getting really pissed off about this
Who(m) XD all secretly wished for Joey chandelier and REAL Ross's entrance ?
"2:07 to last ...I'm in ""I Hate JA Club"" too..  Jennifer aniston is so mean.. I think she got revenged by writer in the episode of 'The One With The Rumor' ..I'm so happy for that.."
Where is Joey and Chandler
