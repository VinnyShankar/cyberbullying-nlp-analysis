Not me watching this on my iphone 14 pro
Elon Musk liked that
I still use it.
APPLE 10 IS COOL
I remember being absolutely blown away during the apple event livestream when they released this phone. It was so exciting and opened up a whole new era of phones!
My favorite new iPhone design
"So sad to see it's not getting iOS 17 
Could have given 1 yr extra like 6s"
"My first MKBHD video that I saw and what made my mind to buy the X. What are the odds that when it came time to upgrade to the 14 pro last year, the video had the same intro song."
Still using a xs max
Bruh
Last
Who else is here after the iPhone X stopped getting major iOS updates? Aka the upcoming iOS 17 dropped this device and the inferior iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus lol
"This phone is now officially gone now :(
No iOS 17 for it"
wow almost 6 years..
Damn bro. 1000$ and 5 years later
im still rocking my X. Its very much starting to show its age - battery sucks and the screen is stained. Still an amazing phone
earphones brick AND cable. Wonder how that used to feel
"Somehow, this was recommended after five years"
Y did I get this recommended after 5 years
Watching this with my 14 pro max sure brings back the hype 5 years ago
Apple should've skipped the 8 and release this X straight instead.
Who is watching this in 2023
Man that's when they actually came with headphones and a Charging brick.
Hi
this is truly revolutionary
Bro you be talking to Dwayne jhonsan?
5 yrs Why am I seeing this
YouTube just randomly decided to recommend this
im still using that
I miss the charger and earpods
"This is the best iPhone that has been released. It was the perfect size, and it was so much better than the 8."
0:47 whops
"I have the XS in 2023, still strong. Although, I will soon upgrade."
"I really miss the phone design, not gonna lie. I loved the round edges. It just felt good to hold."
Hi idol..can have that one?can i have your old phone.thank you
ALMOST 6 YEARS oh god i am old. This dude sells shoes now.
I still have this phone I am using this right now and same colour
Why tf YouTube recommended me this after 5 years?!
Wow why is this being recommended to me now?
little did he know that all the stuff in the box is going.
*Me watching this on XS* lol
This phone is straight gorgeous even today. glorious phone.
The phone that changed phones forever!
"It still feels like this came out yesterday, the new generation of phones we thought would change the world ):"
The nostalgia in this video and it's only been 5 years
watching in 14 pro max
It's in my recommendations today
Still think this was the best iPhone ever.
I remember this thing coming out my sophomore year of high school and it was CRAZY. The first of its kind and a real head turner.
"Watching this on iPhone 14 pro max, when I watched this video 5 years ago it was a dream for me for an iPhone now achieving it is so peaceful"
Just 5 years ago? Swear it felt like a decade since this released.
Watching this on iphone 13
Home button just removed marques not xcited or suprised.
"iPhone X is almost 6 years old, but it still looks futuristic and beautiful!"
Damn it was my dream phone when ut came out. After 3 years bought my own iPhone X and now watching this video for the (god knows how many times) time. Just to feel that emotion
Why is this getting recommended 5 yrs later lol
seeing an iphone come with ear phones and a charging brick makes me feel so old.
the next iphone se should be in this gorgeous design
Why is this on my tl now
How is this phone not getting iOS 17
Back in the days when the notch was the big thing
"Still is, in my opinion, one of the few iPhones that actually feels like an upgrade when you buy it"
A charger AND earphones? Straight in the same box for one price?? What strange times these must have been!
"back then it was the future, now its a cheap part of the past"
hey guys im from the 2023!!!
I still want to buy this phone five years later
5 years
"This video takes me back in time when I was ""actually"" hyped up for new smartphone launches."
What do you mean no surprises? That thing has a charging adapter AND earphones!!!!!!!
5 y old phone mast tha yrr life mein
5yrs. damn.
How have 5 years pasted
5 years? Damn....
My man had better picture quality 5 years ago that what pewdiepie has today
"This was a huge status symbol when it came out, a $1,000 phone was seen as super expensive, a luxury you'd mostly see YouTubers and well off people owning, now a +$1,000 pro phone is kinda the norm."
udah 5 tahun aja njir
Why is this video in my recommendation in 2023
5 years. Good old days
"Charger in the box, Good ol days!"
Still using this phone
2017 is invasion year for all tech companies
Watch it 2023
"false advertisement, i put it on my phone, phone fell on the screen, perfectly fine, turned it around, back is completely broken"
"Ah, when phones used to come with charging bricks. Simpler times...."
Still using my IPhone X
???? Why this pop up after 5 years
YouTube recommendations getting unpredictable
Here i am learning iphone x in 2023
tf is youtube algorithm doing
the good old days when you got more things than you needed in the box (as compared to now where you get nothing)
Ok youtube
"watching this 5 years later ... ""it comes with a charger AND earbuds!?!?!?!?!?"" Ludicrous. What a great deal for $1000"
Still the best looking iPhone ever.  Especially in gold.
"Five years ago, that's nuts. I remember that was a good day for the Apple nerds back in high school after a year of putting up with the Samsung nerds and their S8s. You were absolutely goated if you were rocking this thing. On a separate note, as much as I love a humongous phone, of all the phones I've held, the X still feels nicest in the hand, which is something I didn't care about in 2017, but now my phone weighs six times more than it did back then lol."
0:50 man we really took it all for granted
"back when they used to provide a charger in the box, such good times"
Time flies when they dont change
"Ohh I remember buying this phone, My first iPhone it came in that big ass box and with the whole earphones and adapter brick shit times have changed"
X has OLED 11 has LCD
Why is this getting recommended to me today?
"Damn 5 years , the notch blew away my mind"
Ab to iphone 15 ultra aane wala hai
5 years...wow felt like yesterday
"For some reason yt is recommending me this video again.
But DAMN it's been 5 years?"
This was randomly in my suggested
Iphone x is still legend future of smartphone
im getting old :')
man i still have that bad boy
remember when they actully added charging bricks?
"Me: as a kid i wanna buy the new phone iPhone X 
5 years later 
Me: wow its been 5 years and i still have my iphone x"
The charging brick- and headphone included- oh boy
"no clue why youtube is showing me this now, but hey, i'm here for it"
Even next 5 years this is still iconic amazing video
So Long Ago
5 years and the notch is still there
My favorite so far
Im using iPhone X for 5 years now.. i will buy iPhone 14 pro max by the end of this month...
"the steel egde and glass back is something marvellous fusion, just appearing on iPhone X and Xs, Apple may use this design again
anyway, iPhone X is a legendary phone, it  looks really beautiful and special that recent iPhones can't be"
Wow. It's 5 years already
Good old days when headphones used to come inside the box
please bro give me iphone 10 i am from ethiopia .
Who's watching this in 2023?
Damn there where headphones back then !!
Got a Mac advert before this!
This is the best design to me.
"I'm watching this on my S22 Ultra, but I did have a good time with the iPhone X."
5 year old phone but still decent. Not blazing fast but still completely usable and beat some mid range Android phones in gaming performance
RIP charging block and earphones
"Ah yes, back when the charging brick and earphones were included"
Bro why is this in my recommended
Woah it is 2023.. iphone x is still a beast
Nice
I got an an iphone 11 literally a month and a half ago and it is a true station
"Howaaa !!!!, Earphones and charger !!! 0:42"
So how is Dwayne Johnson?
They including charge head and earphone now they stop is crazy
When does this come out? I can't wait to get my hands on it!
dang 5 years
Got recommend after 5 years!!!
Mia
"Still using this phone and it still works beautifully as the first day.
I will be upgrading when the 15 comes out... the camera ( lowlight especially ) is much missed when I see others with a new phone and their videos and pics."
waiting for september to roll by so i can finally buy my first phone ever (im 18) ... iphone 15 ultra
"fuck man i miss my iphone x, best phone ever dude"
Me watching this vid with the 14 pro
bruv knowing that this was released 5 years ago
why did video suddenly on my recommendations. :)
Best looking Iphone so far ...
wow. it comes with both earphones and charger? amazing.
The beginning of a new era.
"5 years of saving money in design of i phone, well played apple"
I'm watching this in my xs max in 2023. Shout out to the real OG.
*cybernet_hacker* definitely deserves all the recommendations I have seen
"Time flies. I upgraded from the iPhone 6 Plus to the iPhone X when it launched, as a graduation present to myself.
I don't think I've been as blown away by a hardware release since."
"Damn man it's been 5 years since iPhone X, feels like yesterday..."
"U texted ""supbro"" to Dwayne Johnson? Cool"
5 YEARS ALREADY?! Damnnn
Still this iphone looks premium
"I remember watching his videos and wishing when will I get a iPhone, but now I am using iPhone  14 pro max."
And it still looks the same unless you get the pro lol
Somehow the yt algo wanted me to see this now...
"Yea , awesome , I wanted but couldn't afford. I finally got a used xs max, still like the phone always wanted a big screen iphone. Although I'm still Android fan, I use both. Screen is fantastic. I'm into the latest beta updates too. At 71 years of age, I'm enjoying the tech world. Doesn't seem that long. Take care KB."
The X? I should call her
Why is this video recommended to me in 2023?
I'm rewatching this video in 2023 and it's funny to see that Apple included a charging brick and headphones in the box !
came here from recommended for some reason
See you in the future when this gets recommended again
Wow- Feels like some months ago
"""You still can't edit tweets though"" dang that didn't change for another 5 years as well"
Y is this suddenly in my recommendations lol?
"Wow, free headphones, brick adapter?"
"The iPhone X, the last time Apple changed anything on there phones."
Anyone in 2023
Just got an iPhone X
The box is so big. Amazing how much they have changed in 5 years but yet how little has changed
hope we get a jump like this one from the 15 series
Watching in 2023
Pov you are watching this in 2023
Rip Mkbhd
Am I the only one getting this after 5 years
Hmmmm
This was the debut of a new era.
Remember when you not only got a charger but headphones too?
I'm still using an iPhone X cause I mainly daily drive an iPad Pro XD
5 years??????
Why did this just pop up on my YouTube recommendations?
"The algorithm seems to want me to watch this...


Fine."
Anybody watching this in 2023?
am i the only one who thinks its weird but not funny on h=the fact he had dwayne jonhson in his contacts
Wow it appeared at the end of 2022 dec 31st
5 years later still a great phone
MKBHD doesn't look like he aged after 5 years.
throwback to when apple still put chargers and headphones in the box
THEY INCLUDED HEADPHONESS???
Is this a good starter apple phone. I dont really crave apple products. But for my first experience with owning an apple product i was thinking of getting this
The iphone TEN was fantastic
Watching this on my 14 pro max
Ahh man! Time really fleww!!!!
Whose here in 2023?
"Best iPhone ever, perfect size screen, lighter than 13/14 Pro, no enermous camera bump"
"Missing the times with headphones, charger and normally wrapped phone, not some paper sticker on unprotected phone"
This phone is 5 years old. My lord-
Insane that this phone is still getting supported to this day
Fun Fact: X is a Roman number of 10.
I still can't afford this shit
"IPhone X is now 10 years old

















For the future"
Dont know why Xs is so underrated
Aint no way this was 5 years ago
This phone was the definition of future for Apple in the next 5 years until 14 Pro.. Finally the notch looks different in an iPhone.
It feels weird seeing the phones come with headphones and a charging block
Damn 5 year now i got it recommended
"Since this, they keep releasing the same phone with superb marketing."
I'm here after 5 years and still I can't afford iphone 14.
5 years after i phone 14 pro the legend born
Why did I watch this in its entirety 5 years later! Lol
Watching this 5 years later is like wow
Just like yesterday
Days when we got the charging brick and earphone in the box
I am time traveler
Why did they remove the brick?
They should just added a new button on the side that did everything the old home button did.
"I was very excited for this phone, its design was phenomenal creative"
"Wait, iPhone X is already five years old man I feel old"
"watching this on a 14 pro, and im still amazed"
Why tf did YouTube recommend me this in Dec 2022
Can't believe it's already been 5 years
5 years old already and still gets in your recommendations
Suggested by YouTube in December 2022!! :D
"I am watching the video in dec ,2023"
Oh my god adapter and earphones!
Missing those days
It's been 5 years? Man time really flew
Watching in 2022
Watching in December 2022 lol
5 years later and I just sold my X for a 14 pro max
Here from youtube suggestions in 2022 !!!!
5 years later watching this
I got 13 Pro Max sierra blue
this was random
This is a very good video
I remember thinking that 2017 would be special for smartphones in general
"This phone used to be great, but then apple came out with the 11 and then it all went downhill from there"
"How has it been 5 years, already? I vividly remember watching the keynote and the launch of this phone."
back when the iphone came with more things than just the phone.
Yeah just randomly in my recommended after 5 years
It hads been 5 years already. Wow.
Just got recommended to me again
"*even after 5 years*
*this phone still the TREND*"
"YouTube: Here's a video from Five years...
Me: oh my it's MKBHD"
Those days when they used to give free charger.
Ah.. back when a charger actually came in the box. Wonderful.
"This design still looks so good after 5 years!! I wish iPhones lasted longer than they do, because I would still have my X."
Pls compare the camera of iPhone x now and 5 years ago
Last iPhone to destroy all of the Android phones so far
idk why this is getting recommended to me now but wow that notch was wide
I have to listen to your videos at 2X speed because you talk so slow
I just upgraded my dad from his first iPhone ever the iPhone X to the iPhone 13 Pro Max he is absolutely so happy with it
"Hey Apple, how about this than your XR for your SE :P"
Why am ihere tho?
Finally I can afford this .
this is pretty funny in 2022
why did i get this in my recommended list 5 years later
Miss this opening music
Omg an adapter
It's been 5 years. You should reply to Dwayne Johnson. It's disrespectful.
Why the hell am I watching this 5 years later in November 2022?
"That design is better than the 12/13/14 designs IMO

Fits better in the hand too"
Me watching this for the fist time on my iphone 13 when 14 is already out
five years huh?
watching this in late 22 is hilarious
Hey youtube why are you showing this to me today ?!
"Watching from the iPhone 14 Pro and I confidently say, this is one of the best looking iPhones ever made! So timeless!"
watching this from my Silver 14 Pro Max
Youtube be like let's recommend thus after 5 ywrato give nostalgia a
The pixel 2 pictures were unbelievably better than the iPhone glad apple caught up
miss the time apple still includes charger and headphones.
"Its been 5 years since this was uploaded. So in 2022, how is iPhone X and the Pixel 2 doing now? What I do know that iPhone X is still premium until now."
It's been 5 years
Once a year this comes up on my recommended lol
Man watching this in 2022
Recommended after 5 years
Recommendation comes up of 5 years before video.
YouTube out of nowhere suggesting after 5 years
THE iphone X is 6 years old . STILL FEELS so cool ..
watching on 14 pro max
Good olden days where charger and earphones are included in the box
This is the right time for me to buy it when the price completely deteriorate
Here I am watching this on my 14 dang time flies and gosh that wallpaper is nastolgic
Who knew 5 years down the line this would become the norm
"In 2022, Watching in iPhone X, makes it complete!"
The iPhone X is 7 years old. Interesting.
Watching on my iPhone 14 pro max
"""Cool but you still can't edit tweets though"" -Marques Brownlee Musk has fixed the problem it only took 5 years."
"here in 2022, almost 2023. i switched to iphone x a month ago after using android for a decade, and chose this particular model because it was what i could afford. bought it secondhand from an apple fan who no longer needed it, and took amazing care of it; the condition is pristine.


it works incredibly well even after 5 years of it being released. i've seen videos of this phone getting compared to newer iphone models, and it's maybe a half second slower? even less? it's incredible. i'm impressed."
"The samsung of this era where just huge, not really corner to corner so I can understand why people thought of the iphone X as such a big deal. But now iphones just stayed at this same look while samsungs have gotten so much better. I am samsung gang now."
You're getting better with age.
anyone else got this recommended in 2022 November
Wireless charging in 2017 I don't believe it
"It's crazy that 5 years ago, there was an earphone and a charging brick that came along with your new iPhone."
I still have not upgraded to a 10 after 5 years damn
5 YEARS
Bro since the 14 just came out and the X seems so outdated
Who is watching in 2022?
"wow. we got the iPhone X 5 years ago, that's insane"
The earphones!!! I miss those things somehow
Its been 5 years wow.
It had charger and earpod !!!?
Oh we finally can edit tweets!
Watching this 5 years later
"5:12 Elon: ""and I took that personally"""
"Why this came to my recommendation, 5 years later"
"the Alltta intro, the unboxing, the iphone X are so very nostalgic"
Why did youtube show this up in nov-22 ?
It got recommend to me and I watched it and I did not regret it. Unlocked so much of nostalgia.
Crazy how we kinda forget all the learning curves throughout the cellphone evolution
Bro how the fuck is the x 5 years old already?
Here from 2022
"That was the real innovation. iPhone never make a real upgrade ever since. Look at iPhone these years, just twisting notch every year, or change round to square edges back and forth."
Why is YouTube recommending me this after 5 years?
i forgot we used to have the charging brick and earphones in the box
"Who knew five years later we'd be in tears by looking at the ""usual"" adapter and earphones in box. *sob*"
"I know why this is blowing up in 2022 , yeah we can edit the tweets bro , let that sink in."
Why TF I'm watching this?
"I've had my iPhone X for 4 years now, finally going to upgrade to the iPhone 14. Going to be a sad day because I love my iPhone X so much, it has lasted me so long."
Wow! There was a charging brick included :o
Feels so odd seeing this in 2022
I really should buy it before stock go out
"5:12 | 5 years later, we can finally edit tweets!!"
"Ah, the notchstalgia."
Seeing a charger inside the box feels so weird now
"iPhone XS, 11 and 11 pro, 12, 13, and now 14."
Youtube: there's no way for you to afford the new iphone.. so here you go
Even after 5 years.. it never gave up on me.!
This phone was a game changer
"weirdly got this recommended for me, its wild that gestures for the X is a crazy thing to memorize 5 years ago when its now the normal and almost all smartphones to date. they really did revolutionized how phones work and we didn't even saw it happen."
5 YEARS TOMMOROW!!!
"Come here come here, i see u. 2022 attendence is just here"
"watching this on my iPhone 13.  That charger tho, Not anymore."
0:57 Marques knew about no charger in the box future!
Damn I forget about the headphones hahah
Algo..... Why?
0:55 ah that aged well
The iPhone X is 5 years old. Fascinating.
Nostalgic feeling after watching this video 5years later in 2022 with iPhone 14 pro
MARCUS BROWNASS
Watching this in iphone 12 pro max
Anyone watching in 2023??
Was curious who was watching this in 2022.  It was 4 minutes ago.
iPhone X was the last time apple tried to do something different
"No, I am"
I am the newest comment
"The iPhone X, which was once a revolutionary redesign in the series, is almost 5 years old.

Time really does fly quickly. I remember visiting the Apple Store just to check this redesign, but now it looks ancient compared to the iPhone 14.

And look, the iPhone X still included earphones and a charger!"
The fact that this video was recorded on Halloween
I found the iPhone X for 269$ but it's out of storage due to people buying it for the cheap price.
lol
Watching in iPhone 13
Update: You can edit tweets now. You're welcome
"This was recommended to me all of a sudden...
Do I miss this time?"
Stealing Jackets.
You just earned a new subscriber. Please do we still  have brand new iphone x in the system [2022]? Does apple still manufacture it?  People are saying that the available iphone  x are not new but rather decoded ones. Please help me because i don't want to buy used or rephebished iphone x and thinking is new.
It's incredible how Youtube is recomending me this video 4 years later... just wow.
After watching this on my iPhone 13 pro max I realize this is the last time Apple ever innovated. The only thing they have improved after wards is the camera.
This was the shittiest version of the all screen iPhone....4-5 yrs later now the iPhone 13 & 14 look wayyyy better
back in a time when they gave you the charger and earpods
"5 years later of ""Screaming Edge Screens"""
anyone from 2022
Future no charger headphone and still the same
the iphone x is 6yrs old
"As an android enthusiast, I was excited to try this one out in stores because it was-for the first time in 10 years- new. Apple really had to do this though because they were losing the battle and they knew it had to be done to stay in the business of smartphones."
iPhone x is 6 years old
The Iphone X is 5 years old. Interesting
Damn it's good
"I currently have the 13 pro max and an unboxing video of it on my channel, I have it in white. I think ima sit this one out and upgrade next year and I want the black one!"
The best iPhone ever with charger earphones love it
Watching on my iPhone X for the last time
Time flies!!!!
Re-watching this to make my iPhone X feel brand new
Crazy how we actually got something new this year
When phones still came with a charging brick...
Lol look at that and then look at the I phone 18 today lol
14 released and this is in my recommended.
I love seeing things that I'll never have.
Well iPhone X is already 5 years older now
iphone x is the best looking iphone imo i got an iphone 12 but i much prefer the round sounds and not the boxy phones
"Finally upgrading my iPhone X to the iPhone 14 pro, arriving tomorrow :)"
Who else is seeing this 4 yeats later
"Damn, we were so interested to see a full screen phone and this year I have one myself. That's- damn."
I was SO excited back when this released
Ah... good ol days when EarPods and chargers are included
4:09 The face ID can be fooled by identical twins. I tried it with my twin and it unlocked even though it wasn't set up by him.
Memories...
This is the cutout display ancestor to the iPhone 14 Pro lineup
Already iPhone 14 is out
I miss this iPhone
The iPhone X is now 5 years old
anyone saw Dwayne jhonson in message?
Now we have the iPhone 14
4 years
"iPhone 14 Pro - Imagine coming with charger and earphones in the box, couldn't be me."
"Hi, may i ask if iphone x brandnew is still available in 2022? Thanks"
Still using it now
Same iphone since iphone 7
Dwyane Johnson
"5 years ago , there was a great iphone.."
This looks so beautiful
"Ah, how nostalgic"
"Notch anniversary will end this september,so hard to say good bye to this"
i love regen
The iPhone X is 5 years old. Interesting.
Intro music link please
Wow it's been 4 years !
Bruh time So Fast i watch This with iPhone 13
I should have bought this phone when it came out because you can still use it to this day 4 years later it looks new
Imma the only 1 that saw Dwayne Johnson in his messages lmao
And here I am with 13 Pro. Man time goes by pretty fast.
Why is this recommended to me
"Well it's 2022, the intro music gives me goosebumps every single time!"
did i see dwayne Johnson in the contacts-
did i see dwanye Johnson-
"este video salio en mi mejor momento, cuando era feliz, aun lo soy pero en ese entonces no lo aprecie tanto."
I just bought one today after 4 months :D i am so excited
Still a beast
iphone x is good
Fun fact: the iPhone X was the first $1000 dollar iPhone
"It's interesting that people were criticizing Apple for removing the physical home button then! Even I did the same!
And now ;-
""You want a physical home button on you phone?""
*""No! NOooO!""*

*It's been five years! Crazy man! Time flies!"
Whos here in 2023
It's now been 6 yrs
Still using it lol
peak smartphone
It's kinda nostalgic to watch such old videos! I remember how I ordered it in the first days it came out. Was so excited for this phone!
iphone X is better in quality and everything comapared to the iphone 11
When they used to include charger in the box
"Ugh, so outdated, look at the thickness of that box."
You can fool even the iPhone 13 pro max with identical twins
It's been 4 years and that time I think this phone was the pinnacle of all phone in terms of its name and looks
Iphone 9: I see how it is
I just bought oneee
Been almost 5 years since this beast came out. Probably my favorite iPhone of all time. One of the most influential smartphone for sure. Still can't believe it's been half a decade since it's release.
Im geting the too
"For 2 years I saved up money to get my own iPhone, and at 2018 I was finally able to buy an iPhone X. Literally one of the best days I've ever had."
"Wait a sec, you have dwayne johnsons number?"
Probably one of my favorite looking and feeling iphones
I want an iPhone so baaaddd
Nostalgia with modern...
Please tell me why Apple included Wired Earbuds with a headphone jack-less phone
Feels so wierd to see a charger and earpods included inside the box!
the future yup mate you got it right multi cameras big display notch
is been here for nearly 5yrs? i still want it.
"Just came back to watch this after 4 years. I remember having the new iPhone X in 6th grade and feeling like I ruled the world. Everyone was so obsessed with it. I look back and I laugh, but it just comes to show that the phone was truly revolutionary. From then on, any iPhone that came out was not nearly as exciting. After my iPhone X, I got my iPhone XS max, iPhone 12 pro max and now iPhone 13 pro max. I still have never experienced that level of excitement with any of the other iPhones. They're all brilliant, but there's just something about the X."
"try to feel it is 2017 and all are ready to copy this iconic then you will surely enjoy more this video,
this phone changed whole market of smartphone industry 
!!!!"
This popped up in my recommended today. I miss this phone. Definitely one of their best.
"Bro I remember when this phone was brand new tech, now we think of this as a ""lower-end phone"" damn... time really flies"
Remember when they used to give a headphone and a charger in the box ?
the jump between the 8 and this was absolutely crazy
this was probably my personally favorite things to unbox ever.
Does anyone remember back in  2017 we all wanted the iPhone X and whenever we saw someone with one we thought they were so cool
Dam it aged well
Just got the 13 had to come back see wat up
Wow this is amazing
Don't know why YouTube is recommending thing video in 2022
Sheedi
Watching on my brand new alpine green iPhone 13 Pro max!! Upgraded from the iPhone 12 Pro max and gave it to my mom!!
Almost 5 years. The phone that changed Apple.
"Who else is planning on getting  this 
This year"
It's only been four years??  It's seemed so much longer ago...
"Nostalgic with how Apple really change the idea of a smartphone model. Still, Apple is the innovator"
2022
Apple still doesnt have any futuristic looking phone. Honestly iPhones are outdated models
still a great phone in 2022 if anyone is wondering!
I watched this with my 6 Plus
I'm back here again
Is it still relevant in 2022
Can u believe there used to be a charger in the box... almost like we needed it....
This popped up for me today.
whos watching this and the iphone 13 is out and soon there will be a iphone 14?! in 2022
I plan on getting an iPhone 10 from eBay
The twitter edit button will probably happen this year. 2022.
U get a charging brick and dirty buds

"The first iPhone without a home button,  FOUR YEARS AGO??????"
YT algorithm feelin nostalgic I guess
"time flew real fast there. i remember when iphone x got announced, i was so excited for the future... and here we are, fighting C O R O N A"
Anyone with the iPhone X still here

I use Iphone X for 3 years and now I am using Iphone13 pro max

Ah look headphones and charger in the box
WOW 4 years later!! cant believe HOW revolutionary it is!!
Watching this today with my x and the graphics of the video are still pretty perfect good job mkbhd
If a phone could be a soul mate this would be mine. In another universe I would like to anthropomorphize a smartphone.
Ahh good old days... Now everything has changed other than the phone.
Wow so this is better than iPhone se 3
Watching it as its in my suggestions
"It still looks impressive, no doubt it was a huge deal back then..."
Times flies by so fast lol. I forgot you even got earphones in the box XD
4 years later YouTube recommended this
"I am using it for 4 year, not in mode to change, until iphone remove notch"
"The last time apple did some innovation, after that it's just remove and recycle"
This got recommended 4 years later to me
apple does not like to change its design very much.
Why is this recommended now?
Nostalgia
why did youtube recommend me this 4 years later
Remember the Redmi Note 6 pros copied the full design xD
"Earphones n charger 
Funny how times have changed"
"Iphone x is 9
Iphone xs is 10"
Damn time flys way too fast
My iphone X is coming tomorow. I'm excited
Wow......a charger in the box...
"wow, this was ages ago."
Back in the day that was the best thing now it is the oldest
This got suggested to me in my recommendation. WHO here is watching this in 2022
its been almost 5 fucking years and you still cant edit tweets
It really did represent the future of apple smartphones
I can't believe this came out four years ago.
"6 years later, the iphone x is still remembered."
Why does Marques take selfies like an old man
Damn the iPhone X is 5 years old
"I can see a thing that is similar to what is so-called ""Mag safe"" today :)"
At iphone 12 now i am using in India still people buy this as their first phone in second hand market
4 years later and still cant edit tweets
Man I miss this phone.
Kallu
Four years ago?
Lol why
pov: this was in your recommended after 4 years
I have a iPhone X
Such a revolutionary iPhone. Still my favorite to this day. My 13 Pro Max is great but something about the X was just so amazing.
5 years old now and theres very little difference
the rock is in his contacts
Who else is watching this in 2022??
I broke my phone while watching this in  2019
"does someone knows why apple skipped the ""9"" version ?"
Wow
is one Days 1 left.
"0:29 oh boy that aged like fine wine. Only design change from then to the 13 is a few more cameras, sides that cut into your hand, and and a slightly almost smaller notch."
Was that the rock he was messaging 2:43
watching this on my ip11 got me like mehehehehe
the most sold phone of last decade
I still have this iPhone
Here we are at midnight
"I am a twin... and Yes, we did unlock it! ;)"
I hate the battery. I'm keeping my samsung note 9
The iPhone 11 is almost 5 years old
Nokia N9 2011... Thats all i can say...
at 2:42 were just gonna ignore the fact that marques has dwayne johnson in his contacts? lol
"So this was four years ago.
Interesting"
"this is definitaly the best iphone if you dont have enough money for a 11, 12, or 13"
The charging brick.....apple nostalgia
legends watching in 2022

Hello from 2022 (?)

"Love iPhone X , XS Camera Design  more than the new models"
I am using 12 but still wanting X
hello from 2022
Not me watching this on an iphone 13
"0:55 ""Headphones, adapters, stickers it's all in the box. I guess it's a good thing there's no surprises here"". Marques flexing his time machine which he'd been using for a couple of weeks then"
Damn iphone x is now 5 years old
AFTER 4 YEARS I AM NOTICING THIS 2:42
we are in 2022 but iphone x is still an og phone also keep up with ur vids
Huh . 5 years ago iphone X was released . Interesting .
It has a poor battery
4 years lat but me and my twin can indeed fool the Face ID
"im sitting in an airport and apparently youtube is the only thing that's getting opened, and not even the videos, just the plain text and stuff, but hey i can comment"
wow
POV: YouTube decided to recommend this to you 4 years after release
Still young x
"noonne gonna talk about the ""sup bro"" to dwayne johnson"
watching this on my 11 :( missing me old iphone X
who still watchng 2022 ....give me a little bit like
4 years ago? Wow how time flies so fast
Im getting one of theese for my bday its on march
Wait Dwayne Johnson
"I always hated this phone, I remember everyone was hyped even tho it was already behind so many phones, and also I think it is so ugly. I like the new iPhone design way more"
The iPhone X is almost 5 years old. Hmmm.
"Using the 12 pro now for a year, and used the X for 3 years. The 12 pro is amazing for sure. But the X still be my favorite. Beside the lidar sensor and the little upgrades for the 12 pro. The X is still an amazing phone and still love that phone more than the 12 pro. Never understand why people love the square design more over the round edges. My hands arent square either. X feels way more nicer in the hands than the 12 pro. Its a step back to the iphone 5. with the design instead making it better in the hands. The glass in the back of the 12 Pro is also more vulnerable. I already break it on the 12 pro. And that by dropping it from an sitting position. The X had way more drops and still doesnt have any cracks anywhere. The steel on the 12 pro on the sides is better than on the X. The X got strange stains on the sides in the paint. Where the 12 pro doesnt have that. Use them both naked without protection beside the screen. (Sorry for my bad english)"
Are we just gonna act like he wasn't talking to the rock on iMessages.. at 2:42
4 years ago?
"I like that iPhone but I eventually switched to the iPhone 7, although old the iPhone  7 is a bit better at times! The iPhone X is about 4-5 years old and still is fast but did u know that every new version of the iPhone X like the XR, or XS Max ec; was all the same except for bigger sizes and a little bit faster!"
Old days when iphone come with charger
Y was this jus recommended
Wow . . . I remember when this came out
HAPPY NEW YEAR
2:42 is that dwayne johonson?!
Legends watch after buying 13
"watching this in 2021, the iphone x will always have a place in my heart! Its design is very sleek!"
So alone that I am watching unboxing of my first ever iPhone
idk why but i keep rewatching this video
Who else is watching this 4 years later on an iPhone 11?
2:42 love how hes got Dwayne The Rock Johnson in his messages
I still using my iPhone X. He is at 0% battery after 3 hours of use. Yeah i need an upgrade
This is 4 year old iPhone still booming in the market
"5:12 but you still can't edit tweets tho.
2022: yeah I can agree"
It's almost 2022 and this is in my recommendations
"2:41 dwayne johnson sup bro
jhahjahahahahahahha"
"2022 starting in a couple days 
It will be X's last update this year 
Will be my personal fav phone to ever come out. Period"
"Used this phone for 3 years and a half, then switched to the 13 Pro. What an amazing phone it was."
Great video man. Would love to see more about one handed use and reachability functionality in the full review. One of my main concerns with this phone at the moment.
"Mkbhd unboxing iPhone X, me who has been using an iPhone 11 for an year. Yess back at you!!"
iphone x its like a samsung who agrees?
5 years old wow
17m views of someone opening a phone box lol
hi i love this phone
I feel jealous and I have the 12 pro
Ok YouTube
watching this on a 13 Pro max
"Nobody: 
Marques on new phone: Dwayne Johnson
2:42"
"all tho its  near 5 years old, its my faverite"
Is it weird I like this better than the new ones?
Youtube recommended at it's finest :P
Can I just say that looking back they removed the home button very well
"I can't believe this phone is 4 years old

I remember really well when this launched"
The days apple not only gave us a charging brick but also earphones
Want this for my Christmas gift for 2021
Got this phone and upgraded to the the 11 pro and now wondering if I should get they 13 pro.
this phone is still so beautiful
damn 4 years already..
"If you had this phone when it came out, then you literally felt more powerful having this phone. Best phone experience I've had so far. I switched from a very cheap affordable Samsung phone to the X, and the speed and face ID on this phone was mind blowing at the time. It still is a great phone today imo and is more affordable now."
This is the beginning of something special...
watching this on my Iphone 13 pro max
i remember. I always wanted this in 2017.
Remember when there was a charging brick in box with ear pods?? AND THE MOST SATISFYING PLASTIC!!
"WOW, over 4 years old and it still is such a nice phone"
Wanted to see the comments from 4 years ago but all of it is recent smh
Wow when the charger and the earbuds were still there
I just bought a xs and i am so freaking happy
Is it possible to buy this phone in new condition now?
for my new hands
oh you have my IKEA chair pillow
True tone disabled
iPhnoe
Almost 5 years
Did he just text........ The Rock?
"I had the iPhone XS max. It was pretty good, then i sold it too put toward my note 10+ which i still have"
back when they gave you both the charger AND headphones
"iPhone X is now 4 years old! I've already upgraded to the iPhone 13, but the X was truly a great phone"
Anyone else remember when $1000 for a phone was considered ridiculous
why am I getting this recommended now?
Just got this recommendation after having an iPhone 12 for almost a year ?
"Good times
I remember when I felt super super rare since I had the X
Sucks bc I traded my X in and regret it"
Alsbm
"Phew finnaly iphone 13 , price of x  is reduced imma buy it"
0:41 remember when phones used to have a charger included in the box?
a
Hahahaha
Where you buy this phone ?
"4 years, damm  time went flying"
4 years wow it seems like yesterday
iPhone 4 and 10 are the best ones. True nextgen phones
"Cant even get Iphone X anymore, RIP to a true legend in the Apple world"
"Iam saying iphone 13 will also have a notch 
{Prediction) from 2021."
"""it's a good thing there's no surprises here.""

years later, the brick is gone, earphones, gone."
"Remember headphones, adapter, and charging brick, a decent unboxing !"
"Watching this on my 13, why does the X feel more special"
Fatboxxx
Why did I just get recommended this today.
My name is Marquis too
Finally after 4 years I can afford to buy it!
After 4 years later i rewatch iPhone X on my hand.
2021 And I still think this was Apples best looking iPhone.
The 13 just came out
Whos watching this with an iPhone 13?
Over 4 years old and still works... Ok
"When headphones chargers were in the box, ahhhh I miss them days"
To think we'd hate these gestures and now come to use it everyday like nothing.
Gone are those days with hear phones and charging bricks
Why recommend
"wait What were you messaging dwayne johnson aka ""the rock"" ."
those days Iphones included with Chargers and Headsets
I was a junior in high school when this phone came out
Guessing everyone else is here now aswell
Just went from a iphone xs to an 13 pro max and then this comes up
"I Got an ad for the iPhone 13 before this video, how fun"
iphone X is almost 4 years old but it is the best iphone ever (that's my opinion)
$1000 dollars for a phone?? Sure hope they don't drastically increase the price on their future phones!
When I get a phone I am going to have to buy a charger sepreatly because of enviroment or something
Who's here for the iPhone 13 launch
Throwback to the times when they gave charger (video popped in my suggestions 4 yrs later)
The last time we had a full revamp.. design wise
"Looking back, this was the phone to upgrade to for long term use."
"I want this again now, idk it just looks so appealing"
Glad to see the charger :)
Watch this video on iphone x after three year later
This was the iPhone that got me to enjoy iPhone for what they are!
Apple:Why would we put it in the box when we can charge u for it later?
Idk why I am watching this on my iPhone 13 Pro Max
One of the first time apple innovated with a smartphone
I LOVE IPHONE X
"Omg, it has charger"
Why Im getting it in 2021. When iphone 13 has been released lol
iphone x is the last best innovation phone apple has done(next to ip11 series). completely different than the other notchless iphone
3 years later I would be watching the 13 unboxing man happiness in life is tooooo temporary
This phone pretty much changed the game whether we like it or not. The design was a head of its time
"Personally, I would rather still have the slow charger with the wall piece than just the fast charger"
"Nobody:
YouTube in 2021: WATCH IT"
I LOVE MY 13 PRO MAX
It feels weird that they used to come with a charger and a earphones
Watching from my 13 mini
Remember when apple give you a charger that was 5w? I do
Even my dream phone
Feels like Yestaday
