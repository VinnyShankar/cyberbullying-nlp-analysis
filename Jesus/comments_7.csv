Want to watch more from Mr. Ken Block? Here he is talking about his rally hero Colin McRae: https://youtu.be/nLDFHuZxOA8
"I remember a friend in high school showing me one of the early Gymkhana videos when it came out. I'd never seen anything like it. That (and Doc Hudson of course) was what opened my eyes to the world of drifting. It's tragic that Ken is gone, but I'm glad Lia is carrying on the Block legacy, and I can't think of anyone more deserving of inheriting the Hoonicorn."
R.I.P Ken [ford] Block
Matt talling random facts while Ken races through public roads at ridiculous speeds feels exactly like something out of Forza Horizon 5
R.I.P LEGEND
"Der Typ war gut . Falsch , er bleibt gut ."
Rest in Peace a cornerstone of motorsports. Hoon on Ken.
Wow.. I just saw stig sitting there. Lol.

Rip legend
"Let me take a moment to express my deep love and passion for cars. They are more than just metal and wheels to me. They are my obsession, an integral part of my life. The sheer thrill and excitement they bring fill my heart with a blazing fire.

The sound and power of cars transport me to another world. They ignite a sense of freedom and exhilaration, coursing through my veins. In their presence, time stands still, and all that matters is embracing the moment. Feeling their hidden potential, mastering every turn, empowers me with a sense of liberation.

For me, cars are not just vehicles; they are masterpieces of art. Their flawless designs, aerodynamic curves captivate me, igniting a passion deep within. Each model has its own unique character, a story waiting to be discovered, and I find great joy in unraveling those tales.

My connection with cars speaks to my emotions. They embody my excitement, passion, and quest for freedom. My love for cars is boundless, and with this enduring passion, I will continue to chase the winds on the open road.

#CarPassion #CarObsession #SpeedAndFreedom #EngineSounds #LoveForCars #WorksOfArt"

We all strive for just a mere moment in our lives where we are as cool as mr. Ken Block as he was everyday

"Well he now is officially a legend. The man with bigger stones than Travis Pastrana, with a nastier car than the Bandit, and more style than Justin Timberlake when Britney cried him a river. You are missed my good man. May God bless you with a Hoonitrack and stocked Forza garage for all eternity. RIP brother."
This guy was an actual action movie hero.  It's sad we had to see him go.

This man lives on in the eternal hooning grounds
The Waffle House has found its new host!
"Anyone else on a Ken Block binge? I'm still in utter disbelief that this legend is gone. Ken was the one who opened up my eyes to the world of badass driving and Rallying (like many of us here), and rewatching these cuts got me thinking of the insane standards and foundation that Ken has laid for the world of rallying, racing and drifting. Another legend taken way too soon. So so sad."
