"I just posted my newest SUPER CLEAN video on how to Super Clean your Wheels and remove 2yrs of brake dust, tar, and stains: https://youtu.be/5zZyiY23OpY"
My childhood started here.....
What kind of pressure washer do you use for exterior cleaning? 2700psi? 3200psi? Electric or gas?
"Awesome video, however, careful using Ultimate black on white cars. Make sure to buff out real good. Because if not buffed properly it will run and make your paint black (easily clayed/detailed but still)."
"chris i want to to become a detailer, valeter and car flipper as well you've taught me all the basics ive watched other detailers and valeters they dont explain how you do im from uk please understand how i am saying it you my guy do fantastic jobs on cars and teaches the whole world how to do a deep clean instead of a youtuber just wanting views and subscribers thank you so much i know this is 6 years old but i watch your videos few times a week and it wants me to do the this as a profession"
"As you've pointed out many times, the devil is in the details. So, as a mechanically oriented person let me point out a couple of things at 20:11. 
First off, the rusty part isn't the bolt, it's the nut.
Second, since the bolt (or stud, can't tell) that your rusty nut was threaded wasn't rusty there was no reason to paint it --- nor is it ever a good idea to paint a threaded part unless you never plan to remove it. *If* the bolt/stud was rusty, cleaning and possibly a light coat of silicon grease is recommended.
Minor details, I know, but important - like removing rocks from floor pedals. ;->"
Worder
I really want to join
You are the best!
Thank You Young Man. I Am a Professional Detailer. I Have the Eye lol. Goes to Show That We Learn New Tips Forever. You are a True Professional. Keep up the Great Work. Subscribed.
Thank you. I finally found it. This was that I can't find on Korean YouTube.
The paint marker is my new cheat.  Great video.
Thank you Chris.  I just purchased a brand new automobile and this will certainly help down the road.
yeah but my dish dont have a cylinder head gasket so it doesnt care abou thermal shock :D
"All the grease and dirt sinking into the ground and ground water.
all of this would be illegal in europe lol"
"After a thorough cleaning like this, how long before you would have to clean it again?"
I can't even afford half of what you have....I guess a microfiber towel and some soapy wooter is all I can use.
how to clean toyota KE70?
When i did detail I would just use a pressure washer... turn car on first especially if its an older vehicle
"Hello, I want to know is it possible to wash  chevrolet volt 2016 engine?"
2 distributors in the mustang? That's kinda cool are there advantages to that?
Thanks. I just got a new used car and wanna keep it top shape.
"40 year old woman, and im suddenly watching your videos for information and for relaxation ha ha, you have a lovely calm demenour. Also i changed my own spark plugs because of you. You deserve every follower."
Can you spray the altenator with soapy wooooder?
There's one important issue to be aware of when disconnecting the battery. It can cause certain cars to reset their internal computer and lose the ability to properly monitor the alternator which can cause havoc and literally break your car. You would think this would mostly apply to luxury cars but I have a 2017 Ford fusion that went screwy when the battery was replaced.
"Oman I gotta clean my FJs engine bay. Just not sure about the trim restore, what could be czech word for that?"
UFFF!!!!!!!! NICEE!
Thanks for the video.
"F**k off, I got work to do"
Soapy WOODER. That mad me laugh.
Two hours for him all day for me
All you need is soapy woater
"I just spray with  can of degeaser  let it sit for a bit then hose off .
Let it dry then spray with  crc silicone 808 job done."
How long does this clean last?
I got an after market cold air intake. Do i need to remove it?
He really atr from his car
Jesus loves you alot trust in His death 4 salvation and be saved from eternal hell <3 Jesus died on the cross for you bro.
Not so sure if this is right.Spraying all kinds of chemical shit in the engine bay?
When did he clean the car battery? Can you just spray and scrub like everything else in the engine?
Weight reduction
Chris's channel is the greatest car related channel of all time
"If you disconnect the battery, does the car's display reset? I don't want to have issues with seeing 0km on my digital display"
"Hey Boss, sort of a side-bar but, how do you store a hood when you remove them?"
Ridiculous : an engine bay is not a dental clinic.
Wooder lol
"On a scale of 1 - terrible, how bad is it that I just spray my 2012 HONDA CRV with a pressure washer when the engine is decently hot without disconnecting the battery?"
many mechanics say a clean engine is actually not a good thing because they can attract small animals to climb in their and start chewing cables. happened to my father
nahh this is too much work. I'd rather get it serviced
I once powerwashed my engine at the car wash due to a massive oil leak i fixed making it still smoke.  I managed to break a spark plug boot and drove home on 5 cylinders
Your my hero
Cool
1:55 we have the same iphone
When I worked in a detail shop we would use our hot water pressure sprayer and degreaser to clean the engine bay. The only issue we ever had was getting water into the distributor and top mounted spark plugs. And all we did was open them up and blow them out.
He has engine son.  He used engine son to get it looking like this.  Great product great price. Engine son.
How long should it take you to super clean  the engine
"lmao ""hope this was helpful"" after just dropping a staple on youtube"
It gives me goosebymps when u shoot the engine with water
"Nice work. Some great ideas. One detail - I would recommend using Ospho on any rusted nuts / bolt heads etc. It will neutralize the rust preventing it from continuing to corrode the material. Then once it's been treated with the Ospho, you can paint the items as needed."
Wow it's really clean
I was definitely hoping for something that was going to be less work lol
"Cleaned the Hummer H2 today 5 hours in the sun, you would love it. Allah Akbar."
"THIS VIDEO IS GREAT BUT:

PLEASE PLEASE cover the fuse box with a plastic wrapping of ANY kind!!! Make sure its not hot and will melt but ANY water in there is never a good thing. You DO NOT want any corrosion in a fuse box. Play it safe ALWAYS and cover the alternator (orange wire circle) while you are in their (it will always be hotter than any other part of the ending (excluding the block-big metal thing at bottom)."
Could you do an LPG conversion
"I have always kept things under the hood as clean as possible.Not only helps engine run cooler,but when you work on it,you don't need to run to the shower in the end.Clean it hot and most water dries up quicker.Use a plastic bag to cover electrical if you need to drive right away.Injection is nice but some like to be blown."
Is that a fox body 1995 thunderbird in the back?
Very talented young man. Lot of good advice presented very well. Thank you
Is it any different with a diesel engine? Like is there anything special I should look out for if my car has a diesel engine?
"Chris, wondering if the use of restoring paint spray in the hood underliner is dangerous for its flammability since that liner will be exposed to heat."
"Even after watching a lot of your videos, i'm still afraid of doing something with my car, damm"
"Chris I hope you run your own business,  all your vids are amazing!"
Great videos.  Information in concise clear manner.  Great!
I've had my 22 year old Range Rover P38 for a year now and I can't even refill the coolant without getting my hands or clothes dirty. This video has given me the confidence to spend a Saturday cleaning up my engine bay. I may even video it.
"Chris, I just bought an H3 Hummer and the bottom metallic parts have a rusty coating.  I'd like to clean and put a paint or solvent on them.  Any recommendations?"
You know the sad part is that I can say that two hours of cleaning time is almost equivalent to four games of League of Legends. And two hours doesn't feel long at all for the average LoL player.
Man bro just keepin his food warm with us engine
Lol u don't need to cover with a trash bag what u wanna do is keep your motor running and use a heavy duty degreaser spray off and your done
Cleaning computer hardwares be like:
I'm convinced he is the sham-wow guy doing tutorials now
"You are awesome, you do things with your heart and soul"
im super glad you make videos like this! i'm doing a restoration on an 88 ford and the engine bay is soo dirty. It was so overwhelming but seeing this video makes me way more confident
Do you reuse the microfiber towels by throwing them in a washing machine? Or do you just throw them out?
With newer cars disconnect the battery can cause lots of problems. What do you do then
"I Love  Watching /Enjoy Every One Of Your Videos No Matter Its Subject  For There's Very Very Few Car Repair /Fix YouTube Channels That Are Soooooo Meticulous In Every Thing They  Do....but Your Channel ""Chris Fix"" ...Is The ONLY YouTube Channel , That Not Only Is He Very, Very Meticulous , But Shows His Viewers/Subscribers How Excited/Anxious He Gets On Every Accomplished Fix!!...No Matter The Subject!!...YouTube Should Have A Thumbs Up/I Like This  X Infinity  Icon...but Unfortunately They Don't :(...So Needless To Say ...Let Me Be The First To Say ....""Thumbs Up/I Like This X Infinity """

Saving for reference! Just acquired a 1979 el camino that needs lots of TLC.
POV: you press popular.
I thought my Dad was meticulous.. he would be impressed lol. Nice job
This is an extremely good video
I watched the mustang bit the most. I own a marauder
Is it true if you never wash your engine bay more than 3 years you best not to wash ? Just simply use wet clothes to clean up the dirt?
"No No No, I can't do it by myself. Later I will spend more money to fix my car. It's so hard for me. I don't know why there's so much internal organs. I don't know any of them. If broken one, it could be died."
"Hi Chris, how/where can I order soapy wooder? I can't find it on you internet page and nowhere on the internet. Kind regards, Ben"

I don't have a compressor so I use canned air. In little squirts it gets hard to reach places.

For a degreaser/soapy wooder can you just use Kerosene?

"I was so surprised at how many views this video had, until I started watching it. This is fucking amazing information. Your channel in general is one of the most informative, concise, well presented how-to channels I have ever watched. And it has allowed me to save thousands of dollars since I started watching. Thank you!"
I work at valet auto wash been here for 5 years learned a lot.  Never use water well maybe if carefull idk.  I use degreeser with hose connection.  Then on plastic i use that tire shine shit.  You gave me some good tips thanks

Good job
Id rather have Chris do my engines.
LOT IF WORK
Thank you so much I will do this when I get a. Car I love your videos btw
"Hello Sir,I hope you could share your tools and those things you are using for cleaning, repainting and others."
Awesome job!
"Hey Chris. How do the final products hold up over time?  Not so much the dirt and stuff from driving, but the detailing itself (if you just parked the car in a parking lot)."
"Great video and brilliant info :) I've been cleaning the engine bay of one of my cars fairly regularly, but I've learnt much better techniques watching this video and will certainly putting them into practice. I was wondering what the best way of cleaning that oxidised aluminium was and after watching I'm wondering no more, thanks heaps :)"
QD cleaner could work also for the electrical or nearby surfaces near electrical.
What about the fuse box. Is that safe ?
Great video.
What about using low pressure steam?
"I never cared much for the ""car scene"" ( nothing wrong with it, just not my ""cup of tea"") but this sorta of stuff really gets me into the spirit."
"So how do you disconnect the battery with out loosing your Computer data storage so no codes or programing and have to relearning data that is stored if power is lost, Do you use a OBD2 back up battery? And will that power cause problems getting wet?"
"This video is a masterclass in making a YouTube video. The contest is almost irrelevant. It's Chris's awesome attitude and personality, and the way he delivers the content that grabs you, holds your attention, gives you hope that you are fully capable of doing a dreaded task all by yourself, and gifts you the skills to get it done. I am a medium-to-advanced DIYer and I never stop learning something from Chris. Thank you!"
I love this dude thank you so much.
Thank you! This was very helpful and I am excited to do this in the weekend!
I guarantee the average person starts poking brushes in the round electrical components and vacuum hoses and the car won't ever run again
My man says worter
Did not work for my Electric car.
You are a life changer. Thank you.
This video is awesome. Thanks bro
I am so scared to try thissss but i really want tooo
Does this also apply to an EV (in my case a Nissan Leaf) or are there special steps to take there?
Awesome man! The best on YouTube!
does he write and record the script before filming?
Who has the will to do that damm
Make sure you clean the engine when it's hot. You will find that the plastic bag will shrink-wrap itself onto the important components that you want to clean later. This will also give the engine bay a unique scent that your passengers are gonna love.
"I'll never do this, but I really enjoyed watching someone do a good job!  A really excellently presented video."
What can i do about under the engine? My idiot friend took off the main pressure line coming out of the power steering pump before draining the reservoir. I needed the car to work and there are a lot of gravel roads i drive on everyday. So its thick and sandy.
how to make anyone suspicious if u try to resell ur car :^)
dope vid
"Meanwhile, in Russia, a high-pressure washer is simply used to wash the engine ;)"
Your voice annoys me
A+
That the same engine as my rover 75
Great video
"Do i own a Car? 
- No
Do i watch a 20min long video of how to clean a car bay? 
Yessir"
Great video. Where do you get your wood handled brushes with the red collar and bristles at the end as shown in the beginning of the video?
"the simpler way, get a new engine"
"This video is so well done. Chris, you explained every task and editing is satisfactory."
"I love how he has a spray bottle with the words 'Soapy Wooder"" on it"
"I just stumbled upon this video, thankyou for this, im borrowing my mums v8 Ute and its her pride and joy, going to clean her engine bay for her when i wash it, this video was super helpful with a few tricks i didn't know. Thankyou :)"
Chrisfix is like the Bill Nye of car maintenance. Makes it easy to understand the complex things and I love being watching your videos and picking out what I want to work on next.
I came here to learn how to clean my engine bay and left knowing how to clean my dishes. Thanks Chris!
"Those aren't distributors,  their ignition coil packs"
Dish soap is great and does not etch aluminum
What to do with turbos and aftermarket alarm systems
These vids are well put together and presented...... Chris puts a lot of work into the videos..... I appreciate your efforts.
Nice vid.... Cheers
For anyone young like me. This guy is educational in a fun way. I literally took my school breack to watch this.
Excellent video cheers man
i can do this all day!
Did he get cables on top with a brush?
W VID
"Hi Chris, 
I just want to let you know I looked the video & did clean the engine & did the windshield, door windows & it looks so AWESOME!!! on my 05 Mustang. I want to send pictures, how can I do it? Thanks, RICO."
That Ford Windstar is cherry!
I have been pressure washing my engine for years.... Not saying you are doing anything wrong or mine is better. If you are careful in how you use it and what you hit with the pressure you get a great clean and it keeps the engine from overheating do to grease and oil build up. Under Carriage pressure washing works great as well...
bro is the most humble car guy ive ever come acrossed wether its on the internet or real life.
"Just a thought about that toothbrush...  Get an electric toothbrush. No scrubbing on your part, just move it back and forth a couple times.  Also works on tile grout"
"Hi Chris.
Thank you for a great explanatory video. 
Whenever you make a video next for engine cleaning, can you please a hybrid engine and an electric car too?
The purpose of this request is that, from what I know, despite disconnecting 12V battery, their engines are still connected to the bigger batteries."
I have seen this thumbnail in 3 different car washes lol
I used a water jet and cut my engine in half. Made it super easy to clean the inside. Thanks Chris.
Can of oven cleaner and water hose makes them like new again.
My car is a small block v8 and in the past it had overheated a few times spraying coolant everywhere and recently just had a oil gasket leak. Now the car constantly stink from the old oil and chemicals burning. It's such a tight fit in the car it's impossible to clean properly. I'm too worried to spray anything on it. Wish you were near greenville nc.
"Great video. On another engine cleaning video, you used different products. Reason why? My engine came out great."
if i only had a nice car to do this to lmao
Very good info for DIY
You always give me so much motivation and inspiration to work on my vehicles. Thank you
thank you!
Hey Chris I just wanted to ask should I completely dry my bay down before putting my battery back in and should I always tape off my battery wires? Thank you so much for everything you do for this community and people trying to work on there car big love from down under
"Honestly, your videos are the best I have ever seen on the internet.  Thank you so much!"
I started working as a car detailer a few months back. We just spray the engine down with a Hot Cinnamon degreaser then power wash it off. I haven't had a single issue yet.
So many errors dude
take a shot each time he says water
Hey Chris what's the name of the spray wax you using?
"Hello, again! These videos become addicting once you being getting motivated to maintain and repair your own vehicles. I really appreciate your videos! That van engine bay is what I have been searching for; working on 1991 Astro Van and there are oil build up and thick layers... following these steps will definitely help the cleaning process."
You crack me up...your voice and what you say are hilarious. I am learn a lot from you by the way!
YOU NEED TO GET OUT MORE !!!
Personally I just drive through my local river to clean the engine bay
That very well may have added 10-15 wheel horsepower.
Wow great job. Gonna go hit up my 98 grand marquis now.
why you dont use alcochol to clean wires
yer!!!
aye!
I really like the explanations! Greetz from Germany!
"What is a jagwar?
What is aloominum?"
"great video, kid."
i wouldent reccomend eating off of your engine if you have an oil or coolant leak lol
Vi clean his car better than I clean my dishes
"Idiocracy, what does it look like.. Do you only care about how looks?? Sad..//"
he talks like a 15 year old boy professionally
Awesome video!!Attention to detail! That was an amazing job ! You get what you pay for ! You mind sharing what you would charge for quality work like that??
Wrong the capacitors still store electrical energy long after the battery is out of the vehicle. So you still can cause electrical damage to components.
Would this help prevent plastic parts from cracking??
"Amazing outcome!
I made the mistake of getting my truck oiled, and now my engine looks terrible.
When the weather turns nice so will my engine thanks to your help.
Much respect:)"
"This is not gonna work in South Africa, because once you brush everything with the brush, the soap would have allready evaporated"
This would honestly make me want to do car detailing
tbh you can get the engine itself pretty damn wet I detail McLaren Ferrari's and much more and I soak the engine bay and pop on some reds digressers then brush everything and it works insane on cleaning out the engines I've gotten McLaren Senna engines soaked and had no problems so don't be afraid of the engine bay  the are much more protected than you would think I use a pressure washer to and have never disconnected a battery but that doesn't seem like a bad idea
Bout to start parking with my hood open
20:18 just change the bolt?
This is really great. Thank you!
First time seeing your videos. I can see why you have gained so many followers. I definitely appreciate your help bro! Good shit
This is by far the best video ever made on you tube bar none!
Even though you unhook the battery if there still electricity in the components so unless you drain the components you still have the possibility of a short
"Simple, amazing, beautiful."
Back in my auto dealer days we used a 3M engine dressing that takes this 2 hour process and turns it into about 20 min. Absolutely loved that stuff. Great video!
Should I do this for my Renault Twingo?
Can I also do this on a hybrid vehicle for example a 2021 Toyota Yaris hybrid ??
wow! Nice clean engine man!
Do you still have this mustang
clean my balls
Thank you for doing a detailed video showing how to clean the engine bay.  I have looked in the past and no one ever has a thorough video so I have always been afraid to try it.  With your video I feel confident I can get the job done w/o doing any damage.
Sounds like alot odf BS and common sense
aw man.. i wish i had a vette like that
Even though this video is for educational purposes i watched it for entertainment and it was great
what do you do with your old dirty microfiber towels?
"Your product list has markers, but not yellow that you used in your video."

"Amazing video thanks....Here in Texas, if you remove the battery and reset the ECM, you need to drive quite a bit to get the ECM ready again to pass inspection. This can be a real hassle if you're close to the inspection date. I know you can connect a small battery to the cigarette lighter plug to keep the ECM powered and preserve its memory. Can you demonstrate how to safely carry out this process? Option 1: with the battery installed, Option 2: without the battery but with the ECM still powered through a battery connected to the cigarette lighter plug."
"Microfiber is no good, gets caught on everything torn to shreds, i see you using it only on gloss on plastic.."
14:31 did ur pcv valve pop out
If this is your most recent video can you make a tire changing process
What do you put in your soapy water?
"grate video, i am a new sub i worked as a car detailer, back in my high school years and i love this video!"
Instructions unclear: My dyson vacuum clear has permanent water damage
Bloody amazing mate!!!!
17:40 what?!?!?!
First class presentation Mr Chris Fix!
I had a Car that had that Aluminum Finish on Black I ended up Sanding a Polishing it until it shined I got it almost to a Mirror like finish
Thank you
"thanks man, but is it not dangerous to use water like that?"
Is it bad using steam to clean your engine bay? I've seen some videos online advertising this.
"Yoo thank God Chris is into Car detailing , if not he would be a Methodical serial K*iller"
"Good video many people don't pay attention to the engine area, one thing though you may have to put a hundred miles or so on the vehicle to see if there are any codes you erased the history file when you took out the battery it will have to build a new one."
I used this video to clean my cars engine and it looks fantastic! The only issue I'm having is my toothbrush tastes terrible now and my breathe smells like a pep boys garage....maybe I need a different tooth paste!?
"Thank you for this video, i will attempt to clean my engine myself after this."
I have detailed cars for over 25 years. I started my own mobile automotive detailing business MPH Mobile Detailing.  I would just cover the battery with a bag. Same with spark plugs & distributor. Never removed the battery for a engine clean.
Conclusions: I PROBABLY AINT GONE MESS NOTHING U if I be careful but I really shouldn't..
Slow and articulate being detailed and informative...
it took you over 10 min to start...
Love the content especially with the clear speaking and going into detail with the explanation....good job Chris
"What about armor all on the plastics, I try to use it sparingly inside the car because of it vaporizing onto the windshield, your Ultimate Black water soluble looks like a nice product."
Very detailed instructions. You made it looks so easy.
Chris must be a zillionaire
"Did this on my Hyundai H-100 (pretty hard to work on because of the tight space to access the bay). I swear people are like, wtf is he doing detailing while watching a movie (It was this video). LOL Thanks Chris!"
my oil cap somehow came off and now my engine is covered in oil. pls help.
wtf 2 ads now f*off youtube
what if it's not possible to use a water hose?
what kind of soap is soapy water
"Is it possible to wash like this right on the street? ""Does the Environmental Service allow this?"
also am gonna sub
i wish a famous youtuber would pin my comment some day :D i love cars btw
"Chris, dish detergent is really not a good degrease to use as it contains salt and will cause corrosion of metal surfaces! Just like you never wash a car with dish detergent for the same reason! Use a degreaser designed for the job (there are many brands to choose from)."
"Love your helpful videos ,, just wondering if you get any flack from your neighbors about all the cars?"
bing ai recomended you this is quite helpfull
Why does Chris fix it always have painted shitty cars lol
"As a Meguiare's fan I'm glad to see he's not blacking out the logo in his newer videos. When it comes to paint and detailing products, they really do rock."
"Great video Chris. Great editing, narration, and camera work. Very easy for someone else to follow and didn't skip any of the technically important parts."
Also be aware that you can get fined and charged for washing toxic chemicals into your driveway and street and sewer. EPA. $$$.
PUT ALUMINUM FOIL OVER ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS!!
Thumbs up!

thanx
What about Hybrid Cars with those orange coloured cables?
I did this and ate off my engine and I accidentally dipped my sandwich in some brake fluid. Ok to still eat the sandwich?
Thanks for the video! This is my first time seeing any of your videos. I just find it impossible to believe you have NO negative comments. But then again it is 2023.
Can I still brush my teeth after I clean my engine with my tooth brush
Is it safe to use tire foam all over the engine?
Now i have motivation and knowledgeto do this with my Ford Focus :D Thanks
I use a pressure washer with a lower pressure nozzle. Then just use a spray protectant to shine everything up.
Instructions unclear my car exploded
Is it the same for the diesel engine?

14:38 bri'ish people are fuckin LIVID rn
"@chrisfix Kudos for having a Mustang with over 100k miles on her, and the engine bay looks great.  Good job young man."
Lowkey like to watch this video over every once and a while cause it's so satisfying
"Stop, straight just hold up. You have been explaining the car to me for 5 min, and I already understand so much more then I have ever. I came here for satisfying cleaning and I am impressed with what I found in its place! Thank you for teaching me so much and not even meaning to!"
Worter
"If anyone hasn't thought of this, cheap makeup brushes from the dollar store work well as detail brushes"
Good clean vid but one problem. Aluminum is either anodized or has a alodine treatment to stop corrosion. The wire brush cleaning removed the protective layer so now the manifold is going to start corroding.
"Hey Chris, I have a question, if I wanted to paint the interior of my car what would be the right chemicals to use? Would the same process for the hoodliner be used for the inside headliner of a car? Also, is there a special process for painting interior plastics? Or special products? Or would it also just be spray paint? I'm asking because I'm interested in blacking out the interior of my car at some point but I'd like to know the right products to use and procedure."
Feels illegal to spray water in there bro
You're low on gas though
Nice job m8..love it .
I might be want to eat the engine bay next
"Hey cris fix, what's a good spay bottle for molding on my dashboard? I bought spray bottle of mold armor for vinyl/plastic cleaning! You think this will,workm8n my case? Thanks......"

Man you the best person ever have done this. Great job buddy
Dude great video
"Old cars, yes you can clean the engine. NEW ONES, you don't. With all the computer parts that can get destroyed. It's not worth trying."
That Mustang engine massively triggers my OCD. It's messier than the inside of a space shuttle.

Someone spray painted the interior of my camaro. How to I remove the spray paint?

Nice good job nice information and awesome hood stand on the Mustang lol
"You can spray water on motor just don't spray it directly down the air intake, which is easy to avoid. I've been doing it for 35 years and no issues. The rest looks good, nice job."
Thanks!
Best video I have seen on this topic. Thank you.
Well ok. I guess I'm not cleaning that.
I hate it never ever use water on engines fuses sensors electrical I hate it

what was point of this?
The Best and maybe only thorough vid on YouTube. I'll do all but rather/mostly use a well squeezed damp towel and spray very sparingly
"great video glad i found your site,Some of these i've used for 50 years lol learned some new stuff from you. Thank you I might do one for my youtube channel with my 04 tundra trd sport."
your voice NEVER CHANGED... WHAT??
Nice
Amazing!
"Make video to how to fix not starting engine car but this everything failed and you need to fix like 5 things I don't remember what was 
5 was like timing battery and oil or gas  gas pump i don't remember but i think you got the point"
Really great video full of common sense tips overlooked by most fanatics.
"Bro, you are literally helping me. Thank you for the videos"
"Cleaning your engine is like cleaning your computers registry, the cons far outweigh the benefits."
You only need to disconnect the negative
I think we need new profession just like this engine washer servise
"I'm just happy you called it an engine not a motor lol. But seriously, great video."
When i worked at a dealer we would spray the engine bay with foamy engine brite then hose hose it all down and we never disconnected the battery.
"*_captions at _**_1:29_**_ saying ""and ""soapy wooder"" lmao, love this channel and it's content_*"
where can i get a chris fisx plate sticker look great on my tool box
"Chris, that wire wheel on the aluminium isn't going to work out well in the long run. If the wires are made of steel you will impregnate that alu with ferrous iron which means ultimately you will have rust stains on the alu in future. If your wire wheel is made of brass or bronze then you'll be OK."
Good job but Too much talking..
"Nice lunch, bro. And the car is cool too I guess"
"""soapy wooder""... love it"
stop saying wooder

You always do a good job and helpfull content.
Me after an Adderall
Degreaser and a water hose. Done.
Great work bro
Awesome
so I took my engine to the dry cleaners and now I'm banned??
"RainX. , and spray depressed also works well. Like 409"
Alcohol also cleans  well drys fast
"Dry clean, air compressor with long reach extension works well"
I used to clean my 2008 stick toyota pickup without covering any parts and the bay was so open. I used foam degreaser never used a brush just let the foam sat for a while and then spray water no covering. Then blew the excessed water with my blower/vacuum. I didn't have any problem with it then years later about 10 years the truck got stolen
Amazing Job
Bro called his coil packs distributors lol
Ye ole 1990 f150 is so old when my dad was working on it an air pipe broke it still ran tho.
no problems no check engine lights and no gas
What kinda sandwich was that
I just power wash that with some rim cleaner. Then when I'm done spray armeral all over it. Takes 5 minutes and looks just as good.
Cracking metal by changing its temperature rapidly is a myth. You figure this out pretty quick through blacksmithing.
INCREDIBLY WELL DONE VIDEO! BRAVO! I cant even think of one thing you could do better here. Video is cleaner than them engine bays!
This is something I'd love to do to my 98 cobra. The engine compartment isn't dusty but it could still use a little sprucing up. Oddly enough I actually bought a bottle of that meguires black plastic restorer yesterday. Where can I get those brushes from?
"20 differents subtitles, man. I miss those kind of details so much in videos!"
Great job!! Thanks!
The work ethic!!! Unmatched
The Trim Restore looks like magic. I didn't know about that kind of product.
"We have our ""HOES""  top clean the engine"
"this video was very helpful, thanks a lot. 

but why would you eat on your engine bay XD"
Quality work and information sir. Thanks!
I dont think putting water inside the vital parts of your car is a good idea. Dirt and mud just reinforces the pipes and shit. Dont use water ... it makes me nervous... oof
This video was amazing! Exactly what I needed to see. Thank you!!!
"Great video, great tips. Thanks!"
Excellent presentation and energy.  Gret job
What about carburettor cars?
what`s wooder and wher do i get it from???
Second you hid the bad bolts I went to a different detailer btw.... Bad parts need replaced....
Quick q about the aluminum.... Should I be chrome polishing it after to protect and shine?
"hi Chris, thank's for Engine bay cleaning tips.
how you clean the alternator?  i can't see it in the video"
"That came up nice,great job man"
just wash the car wait a few minutes and then upside down the car shake it up that's it!
Dish soap is great for pretreatment on greasy dirty laundry too
"Hi @ChrisFix !
I really want to clean my engine bay especially because I had not taken off my engine cover in almost 2 years, BUT a lot of my rubber wiring harnesses and insulators became extremely brittle and broke off to the touch. Should I be concerned about this, and is there any way to redo the wiring insulation? Thanks so much in advance!"
"Anyone in germany knows where to get microfibre towels? 

Only find expensive oned when i look for it on amazon..for body use"
"End of the video, engine is clean. What lubricant use for shine?"
Best coating for undercarriage of car please?
Such a sh*t video. Learnt absolutely nothing at all.
"I wouldn't paint the hood insulation  you better have new plastic tabs to re attach it they are not that easy to remove on all cars the insulation tears easy. When you disconnect your battery your car computer will have to reset. A lot of cars have a coating over the aluminum wire brush it and your screwed it's a soft metal getting a uniform look with drummer good luck. Use a hand steam cleaner water not a good idea on any engine. Last you can simply use wd 40 on a rag and wipe same results half the time plus you won't have a big mess. This way you'll be cleaning your driveway and washing all that crap into the storm drain. Wd40 does collect dust but protects metal and electrical.  Water creates rust and shorts electrical systems. Spray degreaser on the hood that is going to get all over your windows and paint so now you added another 2 hours washing your car and waxing it.
If you have all day and money to replace things this is great!!"
"6:40 - please, keep the vacuum pipe away from the car body, e.g. by keeping it on the shoulder/between your legs. You'll thank me later :)"
"Rags, microfibers wipes an spitshine."
That is outstanding work and results! I have a 74 MGB whose engine bay has gotten a bit unsightly. I'm going to give it a go now that I'm inspired.
Beautiful
Thanks for a very informative video.
Much appreciated after 5years you r a Genius
"Nice! 
Thanks for the tips !
Greetings from Romania , Europe!"
Before this video I took my 06 Honda pilot to a self wash car wash and I cleaned my engine with no damage to anything and I did none of these steps besides use the engine settings at self wash. Now I have a 08 jeep liberty that needs lots of tlc and I may use this method above to restore the engine as the car has been sitting for 3 years so I'm working hard to make her look good.
yeah but does it make it go any faster ?
You can cover with rubber the side canals to get rid of dirts. you can buy it online
dont get wuter in your car
what is distributor? a coil?
"Try use diesel to clean  the engine, no worries on damage something"
Thank you man. I was searching a lot someone like you ^^
"I love how his videos are timeless, it doesn't seem like this video is 5 years old at all"
You're a legend!!!
i know this video is 5 years old but I just got a car today and your videos are EXTREMELY helpful man you explain it in a way that anyone can understand and I love it bro
How about a hybrid engine bay?
Those weren't distributors! They're distributorless ignition coil packs! Great job on cleaning the engine I actually use more water.
great video!   my OCD and myself are a big fan of your work.   also the 'Wooder' bottle makes me so happy!  :D
"Dont wash your car engine in your driveway, oil and engine fluids will sink into the groundwater. In germany it's even forbidden to clean your car/engine in your driveway and can be fined! So please be aware of that."
Super professional ...chris fx
the enthusiasm sold me
I need help on my 04 Acura tl
love it. -how long does it stay clean tho?
"So I ate my engine bay, and it was clean but my car wont start."
If you use a OBD2 port memory saver is there any risk of shorting out electrical circuits by doing this with the battery disconnected?
"I liked when he said, get the pipe brush. As he knows everyone on his channel has one."
Absolutely the best video of this type! Kudos!
That's exactly the same thing my girl uses in the shower except they have a different name for the products at bath and body.
"Noooo. NO! oh GOD NOOOOO. NOOOooooooOooo. You dont ever super clean engines. You condition it and thats it unless you mud pit. Moving mechanical parts love slime, oil, grease and whatever else keeping it away from water and corrosion. See it as a nice patina."
I chopped my engine in half like you said? How do i put the 2 halves back together? Bits and brakage everywhere
"Hey Chris my son made me watch this video and asked if we could clean my engine and we did. 

My son really likes you man"
"really beautifull, Thank you very much"
"Hi, good job and instructive. Thanks."
He's playing my summer car in real life
"First: awesome! Second: I would have loved to see some more detail on the rust removal part in the enginebay. 

Will do this tomorrow after replacing engine mounts ;)"
Thank you Chris! I just washed my car by your steps and now i get a clean car and a nice bonus - no need to buy gazoline! Cuz my car dont move!
"I love this video. Very detailed and with your video I feel confident doing it myself. 
Thank you so much."
Why you have a lot of car?
"Thanks Chris, I'm  so empress  the way you explained it. I love to watch your video.  More power thank you for sharing!"
i dont have a toothbrush
"Oh my god, my air compressor is actually useful besides airing up my tire"
"Well Sir, you motivated me...For the last few weeks i have been collecting supplies.   Today it was over 9 degrees out so I decided to dry clean my engine of my newly acquired classic Buick.  It looks AWESOME now.   In the Spring i will do more with the wet cleaning.   THANK YOU for your inspiration."
I just bought a new '23 Rav4 Hybrid.  Reading the instruction manual made me terrified to clean the engine bay!  There were so many warnings about getting things wet or breaking things.  I'm thankful for this video and will try the tips here.
"Best part of the video is 20:45 when Chris almost starts laughing because he's so happy, love it."
I love his toilet seat emotion in his voice
Newer cars need a constant voltage supply or you will lose tuning parameters and infotainment settings.  You can use extra care with water.
Spray foam tire cleaner. Spray give it 5 mins. Then blow off with compressor.
@ ChrisFix. Do you still have that Ford van?
0:03/0:04
Warter
The beautify of this tutorial is there is No music.  Great work Chris.
"I leave this job for my car's next owner. I mean, it is a car."
An inspiration and goal for my 44 year old vette
the 30k people who disliked don't have an engine bay to clean
Where are you located I would really like you to clean up a car I just bought
pov i have a honda so i dont need to remove anything to get to anything
im only a kid
how menny steps are there
my dad is eddy
Just use lots of brake cleaner. It just evaporates.
too much talkig bro...like a old women
"At was the Best professional video I have seen. Nothing was boring. Not one extra word was included. Some YouTubers ramble and ramble. It's not the Length of the video that is important, it's the Girth. Right girls?"
Awesome!!! Thanks for share dude
"Awesome video! Quick question, did you clean the battery the same way as the rest of the engine block?"
Wath about the grease bottom?
hey how come you show what it looks like can you keep it for a surprise
One of my first videos I watch 4 years ago
What si the vacuum you use it seems suuuuper powerful
Wait until you have a nagging wife and spoiled brat kids. Good luck trying to rub one out in the bathroom...LOL!!!
Even though I almost never see it I want to do this to my normal ass car
dude ur awesome
Just wanted to say an FYI do NOT use a normal vacuum to suck up water. Vacuums like Shopvacs have their electronics isolated and rated for water so are safe. Great video man!
"CHRIS FIX!! YOU WERE RIGHT!!! MY ENGINE WAS SO CLEAN! I TURNED IT ON, LET IT HEAT UP, COOKED STEAK AND EGGS ON TOP OF IT, ATE ON TOP OF IT, THEN BRUSHED SOAPY WATER ON IT TO ADJATATE THE LEFTOVER FOOD, THEN WIPED IT DOWN!"
"Im always scared watching these kind of videos, if it like only works with certain cars, or like cars only made for usa market, idk man, cheers to u... what im basically saying my knowledge of cars isnt on par with u, so im scared of fking things up... but its nice to somehow see how it goes i guess :) Cheers from Serbia"
Phenomenal content! You can really hear the joy in your voice. Keep these videos comin'!
What about doing weekly maintenance on a new car that just requires using damp microfiber towels everytime I clean my whole car? Thanks!
"Step 0,get a dinosaurus horn ,velocyraptor eggs ,and buy the products from mars,then clean it"
"Worth a mention: If you have worn seals on your injectors and/or spark plugs, this isn't something you should do - the soap spray will seep in and dampen your plugs, then your car won't start until you've dried out the wells with a compressor etc."
this due ghetto cleans the car.
"hey guys, I did the same thing and confirm the result. Dont hesitate to do it yourself"
Super good video.greetings from Europe
"Thanks Chris, these are videos I need most."
Total waste of time and energy
Yo Chris what if we have fog lights connected to the fender near the battery ?
Anything even remotely resembling a Mitsubishi 3000 (~year 2000 edition) should have its engine bay cleaned regularly by steam...its pretty much fact!
WoW ! Really too much bla-bla it pissed me off
great. thanks guy.
"I have a Honda CR-Z, i can't remove the battery for it's hybrid purposes. What do you recommend?"
"Buying microfiber towels are ridiculously expensive in Iceland so I need to use the small microfiber cloths (40x40 cm) because they are ""only"" $8 for 5 of them"
I never use a microfiber towel.  I hate how they feel and they don't absorb water as good as a good cotton towel
"and poof ,a little hard work and patience and your car just became more valuable."
"If you want to simplify this process, just get a McCulloch steam cleaner.  No need for water spraying everywhere, or chemical cleaners.  Sure, the initial cost is more, but if you own a few cars, or you want to do detailing as a side job, it pays for itself after a few cars and all you need is water and electricity."
This is the best YouTube video I've ever watched in my entire life
This a good picnic idea
Most important I learned to spell wooder
"Your way takes too long, too many steps. I know people that took a pressure washer to their engine bay and it worked perfectly and only took a couple of minutes."
Excellent and very well presented video in all aspects.
Disconnect the battery?  Many vehicles today must remain electrically connected as per manufacturers system requirements.  What is your recommendation for this situation?
How to clean carburetor 4 cylinder 1000cc Suzuki alto engine bay.
We did a few upgrades as well as cleaning but Chris's system works
These is why older cars are better than the newer car have too many sensors
Chrisfixes family must be happy to not pay the mechanic
"I cleaned my engine bays once a year, I never showed them to anyone.  My friends were gear heads but we never painted our nuts or showed them off.  How fast you went was way more important."
Awesome teaching skills.  Thanks so much!
"I'm honestly confused on how the engine is so clean that the last time we saw it, it was like it was just washed. Good video"
Thanks
Very helpful but I don't have a driveway or house. Just a self cleaning car wash.
awesome man
how do I clean my tesla?
"Too much talk, not enough do."
I hate cleaning without water
Just spray Tire Foam on the engine and let it sit
"I HAVE A BURINING QUESTION! 
My dad just doesn't disconnect the battery because he is ""scared""  And the service center clearly told disconnwct the battery but no need to remove it. Someone f ing comment what could happen. I'm a electrical engineer and he doesn't listen to me that shit can short out."
Chris's left hand for President! Great video
"impressive man, you made it simple. Just elbow grease and a bit of brains from now on"
Damn that washer fluid part did make a huge difference
21:05
"Great Video, i know it was made a while back, but I can't find the ""black non flammable fabric paint"" all fabric paint i find is highly flammable. Thanks if you can help."
and thats why i don't want to clean my engine bay and risk shorting a car because i want to clean a place where no one can see anyways. So much risk for so little reward.
"Some folks do not own a tooth brush, I know I work with some.  YUK !"
Just hose it
"5 years late to the party and I don't own a car nor a house (with a driveway), nor any of the products you showed, but man...this video is as satisfying to watch as it is tempting to buy an old car just to clean it :D"
"Hey its me from the future, you'll have to redo this in 2 months cause the roads are filthy as shit"
Too complicated and time consuming.
Thank you so much for the video man. This is a life saver
3:18 anyone noticed this video glitch here?
Im glad to see you use a Yota for off-road Thats how I know you know your shit ...lol
How tf you get it so dirty is my question
Watching this got me thinking Chris should do a skin routine care lol I would definitely watch
"*Soapy ""wooder"" hahahahahaha*"
No question! all answered in the video!
"What kind of hose attachment is this that you used in the video? I want to see where I can easily find one. Thanks, Deacon Hill"
Is it bad to just spray it without the garbage bag because I've always seen people just spray there engine off and start it up and nothing ever happened but idk how to go about it as in if I should go more professional like this or just spray it down
Much appreciated
"Be careful. I deep cleaned my car just like the video. Now, I have parasitic drain. My battery runs out every two days."
U suck
OUTSTANDING! Many thanks!!

I love this channel
Why did he just spraypaint the camera ITS GONNA BE HARD TO CLEAN OFF
Thanks Chris so helpful and we'll explained so that we don't make serious mistakes during this process while cleaning.  I appreciate that  you show cleaning methods that aren't expensive. Your comely available products.  Thanks again Chris. Keep up the great work.
"You covered everything and i was impressed when it came to electrical, i deal with cables that get chomped through by a pressure washer at work all the time, so its good you hinted on that!"

I'd be very careful disconnecting battery on some of these cars!! You could fk them up!! These newer cars can spike!
Camber plates....nice Mustang GT!

Got chills from the dirty to clean transitions
Whats your soapy wooder mix ratio

Sending my full support Ariel3dvlog
Nice. I'm sharing this video with the kids. lol.
what about car computer installed in engine bay. People say it should not be watered?
*Soapy Wooder* lol love it
I like to see you do a video on detailing the undercarriage.
Wow they're cars are expensive
Is it the same for aluminum cold air intakes?
That sandwich looks good right now
Excellent!
What do you do with the microfibre towels afterwards? Clean and reuse or chuck away and buy new? Using the washing machine would not be a smart idea no? since it's a lot of grease?  Actual Question
I did this to my car before I sold it. What a difference it made. Thanks Chris.
Just cleaned my engine bay for sale my car and sold it in 2 week
"Wow, you made a very daunting task seem easy. Very informative video as well. Thanks for the video!"
.
"I once ate my lunch off my engine bay, and ended up with skid marks."
5years later.. Im gonna wash my engine bay
Getting water into your engine bay is a dumb idea. You can easily wind up with corrosion and short circuits. What's the point anyway? You don't sit inside your engine bay.
Ohhhh these videos are orgasmic! Makes me wanna go back to school for car repair shit!
A lot of work
"Chris Fix is so good that I would buy Soapy Wooder from him, fully understanding that it's just dish soap and water."
Chris fix you da man gr8 videos all of em !!!!
I think I have an oil leak. May not be a good idea to do this yet.
That washer cover letter painting was so satisfying
"Can we clean the battery the same way? Water down, rince, wax, and all?"
Chris can help your subscribers Happy by giving theme tool's thru raffle ty
I used to think detailing was some magical thing i could never do. Your videos guided me through several super cleans on my own vehicles 11/10 this stuff works
I'd give you $200 for that result.
"five seconds here, 10 seconds there and boom, your whole day is gone. Only a few tools they say"
this video can be used for annoying people who say ''you missed a spot'' because if you do. they will be very very quiet.
You saved me sooooo much money
Does this improve the performance of the car in anyway?
Very handy video! Makes cleaning the engine bay less daunting
"2:05 video starts; battery, water issues
5:13 dry clean
9:09 wet clean"
44M views bro. that's crazy
"Ill have a bit of an easier time cleaning my engine as the engine to my car is out on a pallet, replacing transmission and transfer case"
*Aluminium is anodised. It's not supposed to be corroded .*
One thing though I don't see how just hosing it down first would push dirt into places that you can't get to. Water can get to anywhere better than brushes etc.
Fantastic. Thank you b
super  clean the enjan
"Love your vids, but wow! How many microfiber towels do you go through for something like an engine bay cleaning?"
"I came to watch this thinking I could do it. Nope, even just disconnecting the battery is beyond my skill set. Appreciate the video though."
Don't forget if you live in a state where you have to get your car inspected get it inspected before you disconnect the battery because it'll reset the computer and you'll have to go through a bunch of driving stages so it'll pass inspection. If you disconnect the battery before you get it inspected it will not pass and say computer is not ready
Where would a steam cleaner fit in here?  Great video as always. Many thanks.
I keep watching the video and it finally clicked. Keep breaking down the problem smaller and smaller until it's manageable. If it's to overwhelming break it down. This more than an engine cleaning tutorial it's a way of life. When I become rich and famous I will tell them the secret is too clean your engine bay like crissfix. Haha it's funny because it's true.
This is really one of the most well done instructional videos on YouTube ever.  Thank you!
Why do you do it that way are you Gotta do is spray all the wiring harness is with WD-40 while your car is running spray the whole engine down with tire D foamer shut the hood let the car run for a few minutes with the heat on then raise the hood and spray it down the engine looks just as good as you doing all that crazy ass work
I heard steam cleaning works on engine bays? is that true?
Wa-ter not Wuh-der
Great job ChrisFix and thanks for sharing!   How much would you charge for this service?
Could you do a video about maintain the car after super cleaning it?
perfect now i can wash the engine bay of the car that i don't have
"In case you didn't know, washing up liquid (dish soap) actually contains salt, not a good idea to use on steel (metal). Even if it's painted, there could be tiny chips or none visible damage to the surface. I would recommend using a liquid 'hand washing soap' from any pump style bottle. Better safe than sorry."
"I watch all your videos Chris. The way you explain things in such a thorough, clear and concise manner make your videos the best and simple to follow."
buy a tesla then
"Wow that only too two hours  Think that would take me all day.
But the engine looks great,  I need to does some of this, probably not the level you did but at least to get the main dirt/grime out."
How should I clean the battery? Should I put the trim restorer on the battery as well?
doing the lords work
Yo Chris how do you get animals not to get in your engine interior like rats cockroaches mouses
Great video's. Perfect editing keeps attention. I really like the way you did these. Thanks for the effort much appreciate
"9:17
""Everything you need to know so you don't damage your engine.""
*Then sprays around engine as if covering part of it makes any difference to the exposed wires and literally any other metallic part of the engine exposed to water*"
"You know I'm watching this video now to just sort of spruce up my engine bay while I swap out some spark plugs (most of the junk is out of the way so I figure why not) and wanted to say thank you a lot, dude! I've gained so much confidence from watching your videos to the point where I can just hop under the hood and get to work without thinking or feeling any sort of 'oh my god i'm gonna destroy my car' attitude! Thank you bro!"
"I have a question, how long has it been since we cleaned the car engine? every month or every 6 months?"
you could just put the car in water
"Started watching this because I like looking for tricks of the trade because working in the trades my whole life. Things I broke my ass doing, Then an old timer would watch you bust your butt then once he had his laughs, you learn a trick of the trade. Which most times it's life changing. Thanks for the video though"
who cares if the engine bay is clean i just want my engine to go fututututu
"u are British by saying ""wodah"""
Small things is all the difference!!! i agree bro!
"Anybody who needs pipe cleaners, I have boxes for sale."
@yo boy
I feel like you must be a Virgo.
What does a hard reset do
Nice work
"I learned a lot!  (Also, it wouldn't hurt to check the seal around the lid of the fuse box and make sure it's in good shape.  Water in the fuse box would be a real problem!)"
One of the best channels in YouTube... Should get a DIY award of something...
Lol imagine having a hood liner
Thanks Chris! This was super helpful and very well presented! Cheers!
clean another engine now
hi
For certain parts are you able to use lemon wipes to clean dirt off?
"If the was a world championship for talking, my money will be on you!"
"OK so usually I am mesmerized by your mad skills, detailed prep. and stunning results ... in fact I've used more that a dozen procedures on my 2012 Volvo S60 T6 Polestar.  Having said that, this video absolutely scares the h-ll out of me ... I find it impossible, no matter how careful, to avoid the high likelihood that I will damage some electrical component or mess up the belts.  While I will never have the courage to follow any of the water based soaking work, it certainly does help to know that I can do even more cleanup (I wipe down the bay by hand on a regular basis with soapy water).  Your show-and-tell on cleaning metal is a winner and sparkled up everything with the wire brush.  Keep making these videos they are insanely useful to all of us ... It would also be great if you can share with us what car jacks you use and other tools - I've had some bad luck and dumped 3 I had bought off Amazon over the years - none seemed to last no matter price point ..."
Just cleaned my engine bay yesterday. All your tips really helped out and I got to learn about my car in the process.
You're a legend. Thanks dad.
You should redo this so that the next gen can learn from you
"Well done, enjoy your enthusiasm"
You can't use a steel brush on aluminum. You will cross contaminate the aluminum and and will rust.
"Cool, but I'm still too nervous. Will probably just hire someone."
Does removing battery interfere with the internal computer system?
"Or a much easier and faster way - spray it with degreaser, let it sit for a minute, pressure wash it and spray water based dressing/shine."
can u give me a shoutout
so...just clean it like anything else?
The soapy wooder doesn't have the correct link! Could you mind update the right link to purchase!?
love the super clean videos great job thank you!!
Why do all YouTube people talk the same?
2 hrs is not bad and the best job I've seen.
But you bit the part of the appl that wasn't touching....
#1  is a crapstang
So basically 100 micro fiber towels is what it takes to clean a Engine..lol
"Outstanding video, My 2014 Corvette only has 10,000 miles but i really want to keep it showroon=m looking. This is a great help I need to list the steps on both sides of a 8 1/2 by 11 sheet of paper then laminate it so i can refer to it as I clean. I see I need a few for brushes and towels. Simply perfect for my Sat morning cleaning time. Now about my Wheels?????? Dennis"
Chris how does one protect his/her catalytic converter from being stolen?
My friend pressure washed his truck. We replaced spark plugs and we are waiting on distributor  parts now. Sent him the video. Glad to know the right way to do this. For when I do mine:)
"Nice video man. But, those are coil packs Not! distributers"
"You definitely break it down so that almost anyone can follow along and do these things that feel daunting, or as many, (myself included sometimes) are just plain ignorant to. The cost-effective and alternative methods are great as well.  You are a Legend as far as I'm concerned! You help so many people. The biggest High Five man!"

I am lazy to do all of these........because I have to buy all of these tools..........are there places that I can go and they will help me clean this up??? thank you

Not sure with my 5 series BMW I can disconnect my battery due to the technical stuff (sorry not a petrolhead ) it needs to have a reset or something that BMW do to make you take to them I think.

Than you Chris your videos are really helpful and enjoyable
Don't forget it's very very very important to wax your radiator cap
I want to say thank you for doing this YouTube video. I have seen others but they just do not compare to yours. Thank you so very much because I can do mine and feel good about it now. I do have a question: Can you use armor protection products on the engine compartment? Once again thank you!! Great video!!!
"Hey Chris, after using rotary to clean top of engine, should we add any polishing compound? in other words, was there a corrosion protectant before we polish and could we cause corrosion to come back faster? Any suggestion on buffer accessory to use that's strong enough to smooth out abrasive marks caused by the rotary? Thank you."
Heard him say f-u guys at the beginning lmao
What do you use to clean the brushes and cloths with afterwards ?
"This will be fun to do with my girlfriend...























No girlfriend here."

With drying you can also use the air compressor to reach some far or difficult places.

"Don't put water on hot engine 
My father cool down his engine by putting water on it"
Oh my God. I thought you were going to show us a 5 minute trick and that's it
Great job bro... Gonna try that this weekend.
"Well done, nice 'how to' video."
"I was looking on Australian eBay for 'Soapy Wooder'. 
Could not find it anywhere. 
Then I saw a write up in Urban Dictionary. 
 Soapy Wooder = soapy water. Ohhhhhhhh !!
It was Urban Dictionary which bought me to this video for explanation.
Slap on forehead. 
I thought I had an accent :)
I confess, I giggled like the idiot I am."
"Silly question, what types of gloves are these? I've got medical gloves but they don't go up so high. I've got kitchen types but they seem much thicker than these.
Thanks in advance."
Can you advise how to clean a Jeep Wrangler engine bay?
Easily the most satisfying video I've seen this year! Thanks for being you :)
AMAZING VIDEO! I nominate you for a Youtube award!
could i use the pens on the faded lettering on the buttons in the interior?
I just decided not to clean my engine bay myself cuz I don't wanna buy those tools and possibly ruin my engine if operated improperly...
"just ran across your videos, love your easy to follow presentations and haave been watching one after another since. Do you have a video on how to replace a pos battery  terminal on  a Ford 2002 F150or something similar.  Thank you for doing these videos."
"you do great informative clear and simple vids that are really well done so thank you for that, one thing that seems to be a glaring omission is the lack of any vids on glow plugs! I have searched your site and have not found any, is there any chance you can help us clueless with a vid on testing and replacing, and maybe identifying if glow plug or relay or other faults cause the glow plug warning light and if you can a demo of what to do when you break a glow plug off in the block? I am sure it would be popular and would help save many a nightmare, there are many vids out there but none as informative and easy to follow as yours, maybe I am just a brainless brit but I like things that are well presented are shown clearly ion camera and ok I am not used to the metric vs imperial but it seems to me that it would be very helpful to have both when stating sizes, etc as your viewers are worldwide it would save them a load of confusion and all needing to download a chart to see what size you are talking about. anyway, cheers for all the great work."

No one has engine bays that clean
Very cool! Thanks for sharing!
"Two hours?! You're a professional. It would take me four hours, but it would look as good. Great job"
So if people don't know the passcode to the radio?
When you do the engine bay it looks so cool it when you clean it
"Hi Chris,
thanks for your videos as they never get boring and are always positive! What do you do with the Microfiber Towels? Wash and reuse? If so at what temperature?
Thanks a lot."
"On the WD40 topic, pretty much most mechanics where i am sparay up the engine/ engine bay with it, but then again its an island so salt is all over in the air."
really good video and i love how u show the steps nice car too
"Also, with disconnecting the battery, if your car has any wires or connections that water can get into, they can rust REALLY (okay like in a day, so not really) quick if they have voltage across them. Disconnecting the battery protects from that!"
I keep mine clean and oiled it runs better with an clean engine.
What is the little filter on the intake of the shop vac. Interesting in added one to mine now or 3d print one with car intake filter
