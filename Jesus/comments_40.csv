Meanwhile they call people walking through the halls of the capital building a riot on the country. Dems are trash literaly human filth.
Prison for all of them.
"If these 16/17 year olds can start a riot over a PlayStation, Imagine what they can do if there is some extreme situation."
"This is what happens when you make it easy for woman to leave feathers and provide a financial incentive for the woman to leave the biological father, to become become a single mom on child support with no farther figure, or a string of dead beat men, 
if the single mom meets a beta man who supports her children new guy the mom will always be on the children's side and the stand in dad will have no authority over the children when they are unruly or disrespectful to him or crime related things 
At a young age,
Most of them so-called kids probably come from farther less homes where there is a lack of discipline or the bata man of the house has no authority to discipline the children.
Biological Parents need to be held financially responsible for their children's actions, 
And all fathers and stepdads or boy friends living with Kidd's should be allowed to physically discipline unruly children over the age of 10 to a certain level who live under their roof and don't pay rent without being prosecuted."
"You know what, stop complaining until you start voting the correct people on and the wrong people out."
"Encourgaed by influencers? If so, then I wish that those influencers would encourage these animals to jump off a bridge."
All because of some stupid gamer.
Jason aldean -Try That In A Small Town
Lol faux
"Let me get this out of the way. $75.00 for an UMBRELLA? I saw the umbrella and thought that looks nice. not.
I understand your point about how it depends on who did the action whether you should hate the action or not. I also understand your points on political bias
Next. Every public gathering requires a permit. End of discussion. You don't have a permit and associated security required You are held responsible. Write it into law all across the country. I said this when we all went through the riots. For all that is holy you have to get permission to hold tables at the park to have a birthday party and specify how many are planned to show and for how long.  The entire nation has had long enough to get these laws into effect. 
Oh. You just said about the permits....Agreed.

You have thousands of kids with $200 and $300 cell phones out on the street (during school hours?) Trying to get free playstations? That picture alone is a wtfudge bunnies? And we have the new phone every two years thing? Lord have mercy why are phones not built to last 20 years. I still have a princess phone from my room back in the 70""s. Save the phone money and get a playstation every 3 years.....and again. Why do we need to keep buying playstations and computers every few years. 
The problem is a disposable society and the toxic waste it generates. 

Yes. There were people there specificly wanting to cause trouble, since the instances of these event and the havoc created are showing up more and more. And the planned mob mentality seems to be quite similar to the instigators who traveled from one riot to another getting people riled up. 

What does it say about the world that this is what our kids en masse, must have, and they believe their options are limited. We need manufacturing jobs back and we need them now. Apprenticeships and Journeyman on the job programs  for a quality living wage, and USA products made with pride and made to last.

There is volumns of political and cultural crimes, hardships and just plain wrong happening in this brief clips. So, so, so much more going on here than just political agendas, bias and out of control teenagers...or even governments not taking steps to fix known problems from years ago, or poverty from Obama's announcing he was shipping USA jobs to China and India, making the USA a 'service and internet' global resource and shouting that Trump will never get industry back to the USA. We are looking at proof positive that desperation abounds and hope is in a limited supply. Our jobs need to be our jobs again. Our country needs be completely self sustaining again."
They don't even have to bus people in.....Representing
New York City used to be the greatest city in the world. Just remember that.
"Mob of ""teens"" and ""young people"". AKA, black people."
if the guys beating the thief were white they be charged maybe with a hate crime
The US is in shambles. Police kills unarmed individuals for being 'threats' but mobs on a rampage mean nothing to them?
"Yeah, OUTSIDE the subway station."
"The ""outside influences"" are Democrat policies."
"A civil war is on the horizon non usa, not between the confederates and the union, (most younger people will have little or no knowledge of that civil war)"
Game Boys?  Is this the 80s?
Interesting. They all look the same. Weird.
"Ironically, the 10 worst crime cities are in RED states."
Drop the mother of all bombs
Stupid black mayors
The mayor is a criminal himself
Mayor Eric Adams and co making more excuses for bad behaviour of lawless scum and lack of policing.
It's good to be merciful but it's also good to be wise and have healthy boundaries enforced and accountabilities to established.
Next thing will be to outlaw people gathering in puplic! For public safety  obviously. lol
"These kids old enough to know right from wrong, break out the raid on these cockroaches."
New york need to get rid of democrat politicians. That woukd solve the problem
So go fund me could start vigilantes starting with a 711 employee? Keep your mouth shut
"Time changed everything 
No more Teenage games 

They must count all the illegal activities same as adults in USA .

USA has too much freedom for teenagers.
Teenagers knew the Officers Or court will not punish them. This wil happen over Ave over again.

So The Gov must give heavy legal punishments to teenagers in USA by law."
Must be white supremacists....
"Lol...
Mayor
Governor
Police Chief
....look at them, and you realize why NY is now a shythole."
"ok not mobs a GAGGLE OF CUNTS, there you go.
Actions should have consequences"
"Stop looking at the as a group? They ARE a group. The word 'group' has a very simple meaning...

noun
a number of people or things that are located close together or are considered or classed together.
""these bodies fall into four distinct groups"""
"How are we SO certain that they are ""teenagers""? Is that really the common denominator?"
"People of Chicago, listen to me just once replace these democrats if you want a city at all,and yank your youth up and start teaching them respect by whatever means"
Not like in the old days we had Big Paulie pick up 10 people and gave them a 5 nite stay in their choice of ICU.
the Marxists won't insult their standing army.
Yo yo yo MTV raps.
While this is going on oh sleepy Joe and his boy are stealing all they can
No sleepy Joe and his administration got this started and its the norm now.
These Large gatherings of MOB criminals who should have gotten an A$$ Whippen (like I did when I misbehaved) when they were 10.
No if there were good kids in there they would have left when this started
Go after the one that promised the play station its not that hard .
that's yo people
This was like Trump's insurrection.
"Our children shouldn't get a pass when they do something wrong! Constantly giving them a pass and and excuse to act like this, creates this exact thing! They aren't afraid of getting arrested, or having to pay a huge fine! They know for a fact that NOTHING is going to happen to them! Terrible! If my kid does this? Throw I'm in jail and let him pay a consequence, so he will never do it again!"
Put them all in jail
Looks like the only valid point the mayor of chicago has is the one on the top of his head.
I'm not racist but my black slave is. It makes for a confrontational relationship
Gameboys... that dude is old
"Why do y'all care about us so much? Worry about Flyover, USA, and stop worrying about us!!"
Black teens
Lock em up disgusting!
This is typical behavior for this demographic
you can deny deny deny but Trump sent them to cause anarchy. Trump even lied that he would join them. shmeck
Mayor said Gameboys. 
Democrats are destroying the United States.
Fox lies are just loving that America is falling apart.... Still working for the traitor trump
Who is babies ?? Those criminals??
Dump
"Libtraitors infestation.... 

Jason Aldean said it right !"
Free game boys lol
Dems are out of their minds.  If you vote Dem then you are part of the problem and out of your mind as well.
1:11  What is Ofescate?
This is why we have 2A. Try that in a red city.
Gen z don't give a fuc. This is what happens when you don't slap your child for being an idiot.
"If you want to safe your country, so please deport all outsiders"
They're just misunderstood. And I'm sure the Dems will want those 7/11 guys locked up for ten years for beating that poor robber.
How come no one's asked a question yet did he even give any PlayStation 5S away?
"So sad our country is not the same anymore under puppet clown Biden administration, they allow it to happened, our country is dying before our eyes, homelessness like a wars zone in LA, SF , it time to put clueless man in nursing home, Biden"
Lousy mayor
Start going after the parents of the teens under 18. Why are your kids running around in mobs at midnight?
Its shitty parenting period
Wow....language folks don't call a mob a mob..
Lol Gameboys
"New york must demand their leaders take 3 open hand slap directly up side the head,  live on local news. They can call Dana White for a good slap fighting referees."
The Mayor and his staff are complete idiots
This Mayor is just another example  of backwards thinking ! What a complete and utter  IDIOT !
What a Idiot yawl voted into Office. Its a Mob. Not a gathering.
"SEND MORE IMMIGRANTS. 
MEXICANS FOR TRUMP 2024.I"
"This wouldn't keep going on if officers and victims were allowed to open fire on these young adult animals who are completely out of control in 2023. This is why our world is so messed up. These young adults in today world know they can do this because they know the officers and the victims can not open fire on them. If one or multiple of these animals are bashing in your car windshield and you open fire on there ruthless A z z . Then you are the one on trial . Its ridiculous the way our judiciary system is in today's world. To bad it wasn't back in the good ole western days, This kind of behavior wouldn't exist because these young punks would know they would be shot dead where they stand. Bring back the Western days and watch this kind if behavior disappear. I need to run for President, I bet you i would clean this stuff up ."
Try THAT in a small town
"Liberals have succeeded in breaking apart the family (especially with Af-Am communities), they have made education worse so these kids have little to no real future, have taken God out of culture, and they make excuses. Gee. What could possibly go wrong?"
America. EVIL YOUNG HUMANS...
What did they have to say about the montgomery brawl.
lol it aint just the libs who hate N's.
Charge the social media influencer with all the damage and disturbing the peace and destruction of private property
"Remember when they people of TULSA OKLAHOMA, Murdered all the black people in TULSA OKLAHOMA 
 Hundreds of Black People MURDERED. Who killed all the BLACK PEOPLE"
Democrat cities are Criminal Clown Worlds.
"This is an example of why we need to go back to traditional values and roles. If mothers stayed at home instead of chasing a career, children can be monitored. They can be taught how to behave instead of being influenced by social media and their peers. We have made material things our priority instead of our family"
Keep that energy when there's a large crowd of white people after a Stanley Cup win and they tear up the city
"These stupid kids see the bums in Chicago, so these jerks do the same thing. It is a Parenting Problem. Why is it a problem? Cuz the Black  kids aren't spending money the way the white kids do down on Spring Break in Fla. and the Carolinas.."
The white kids with money do Spring Break! No one comments on how obnoxious THEY are!
Gamboys BTW
"Ooooh now i get it there was outside people causing this right, now i get it
But there wasn't any FEDS at Jan 6 .
I know its gotta be Trumps fault isnt that the dems new call"
US should play Test Cricket .
Gee!  Like Antifa on Jan 6!
"But, Jan. 6th was an ""insurrection"" ? BWAHAHAHAHA!"
"Yep, they are not criminals if you don't enforce the laws. Sounds correct."
They don't want to say who it is if it was all white crowd imagine they headlines this is all black young adults no fathers and think they can do what they want they are responsible for 50percent of all thr killings in America is insane
"Al capone, really?"
They are all black people it's just how they ruin their own city's and look at the neighborhoods they are lawless its 90 percent more all black crowd
"Where are the parents of these TEENs?????? Not only should the teens be charged so should the parents and make restitution to the peoples damages.   Get if your Democratic high horse and admit your wrongdoing by allowing this,  and No outside funding for lawyers, bail or anything.  No more excuses!!!!"
"Sorry hoodlums are the problem they don't care about anyone but themselves and what they can take. It's time for ALL the caring and loving Americans to unite together against them. We must stop all this senseless violence's. Our young people have no personal, family or social values."
"If it was social media, it would effect all races."
Single parent? Working? No excuses. A child's character is developed by eight years old.
That Mayor needs to take off his  sun glasses to speak to the camera.
These democrats are so far detached and gone.  I absolutely and so sick and tired of liberal BS
They are not children...they are thugs...  America is doomed.. period.
"A city with an incompetent mayor, government and judicial system."
What do you expect. Bunnies causing the Mayhem. And bunnies running the cities.
Must be republican voters causing trouble again.
3rd world country
Don't listen to him folks. My plan is working and working great. Hope you all like eating bugs and trying to charge your car when it pops off.
"OMG I'm running alongside a car WOOOOWWWWWW WOOOOOO AMAZING OMG NO WAY.

SO PATHETIC, IT'S ACTUALLY UNBELIEVABLE"
"Jesus cannot come soon enough, this time we live in is evil at best"
Bring back the fire hoses for crowd disbursement
todays youth is the worst in the history of mankind.  To bad we have all these degenerates in our countries largest cities.  Makes you never visit these places.

Animals
South Sudan or New York
Imperialism (the woke one) falling apart
Liberals Lmfao trump 2024
On the 7 eleven. Employees need to start suing the company for hostile work environment and PTSD. When corporate start beeding money. You watch the lobby groups change their tune.
Here we go again!
The kids didn't have decent parents
The satanic democrats will never admit that they are wrong. Your city will fall.
Adams is just another satanic democrat and all satanic democrat run cities will fall and you will eat your own children just like they did in the Bible when they turned from God. If you are a good person git our. Your large food stores are leaving.
To call these politicians anything other than terrorists is inappropriate
Did anyone noticed the lack of diversity?
The five did not like to talk about the brawl on Alabama riverfront  dock.
"Large gathering?
What a joke."
The people that commit crimes need to be spanked just like the 7-Eleven if the police aren't going to do anything at least we get to spank in public defenders that are robbing and stealing
"If those ""large gatherings"" were white, Chicago's mayor would be rightfully calling them looters and thugs."
This reminds me of the continent of Africa.
"The outside influence they have a name. It's called antifa. This is what they do, by the way, and tifa works for the left."
A bunch of out of control kids who need their butts whupped!
"Not looting. Just because they are powerless people with no voice it's called looting. I wouldn't want it to happen to me or mine. But yet it is. Taking stuff that doesn't belong to you and the destruction of people's lives or work happens from the top down, and everyday to me. Get off us. Get off the people. If people can mask their involvement and blind in and use the people as cover just by offering kids a toy! The kids in this country wanting and needing a toy that bad? Lives must be miserable. Y'all all don't give em nothing. Make em work for it. And please don't forgive em. Think there is nothing wrong with the country? Well ok. Dang near make me want to become a democrat. Well we lucky for Trump. Outside of that I'd vote for Hunter Biden instead of republican"
We've been sold out folks.
I think any teen offender should be cut off from any social media
Lol reap what you sow
"Mr. Mayor i thought fireworks were illegal in NYC, especially in a fireworks free zone!"
LET NY and Chicago ROT....The people who elected this WOKE and Stupid mayor deserve them...
Little assholes is what they are!
Begin Humans good and evil  humans race Language all over the world and good and evil animals all over world always will be until the end of world.
I think it's better to b a criminal than a law abiding citizen in America these days
"""We've found the Enemy, and the Enemy is Us""!!!"
I see a common theme here. A certain demographic. Wild and out of control. Subhuman.
Only in America. Nowhere else.
This mayor may need cleansing asap
This mf really say Gameboy?  Gtfoh
Democrat politicians love the criminals and punish law biding citizens
"It's a MOB, dumbshit."
I'm so sick of these people and their mind games and their corruption!
Most of these teens are ninjas.
Where have they gone people. Existing on the surface only. What an absolute shite hole.
"ADAMS  ..  EXCUSES,  EXCUSES, EXCUSES    . NEVER MANS UP . NEVER TAKES RESPONSIBILITY."
GOD HELP AMERICA FROM BIDEN
Anyone part of this riot should get a mandatory 20 years in prison. Period!
Problem seems crystal clear to me.
Poor victims
"Put them N*****S to jail! Those are NOT KIDS, those are CRIMINALS."
EXCUSES...YOUR USELESS
New York Detroit Chicago Philadelphia all going down the tube due to lack of leadership
Also the mayor of Chicago needs to resign failure of leadership is not exuable
He needs to resign immediately for failure of leadership
If there were good kids there they would have had the sense to leave that situation or got way way back to observe.
Liberals and black people terrible mix
Offiscate?
Look at how he tried to twist the word mob#$?#!!! In that sense of the word mob means mob riot!!!!! Mob a vast amount of people collected into a small area the only thing being obfuscated is the mayor's own words
"Love it when they use y'all word.
Like they do in the streets"
Please for the love of god stop calling them teens.  They are black animals that they are letting them get away with it
He's the dumbest mayor I ever seen
good lord.. someone tell that guy what murphy's law is.
Do they have jobs to go to...they have lots of time on their hands .
Hmmmmm. Keep making excuses.
Liberal cities are cesspools.
why
"Teens, is that what we're calling them now? I liked joggers better, and some of the older names were even better than that."
Arrest them and throw them in jail give them a punishment so they don't do it again you people are making up excuses for them instead of punishing them this is why they do it
The mayor is a straw man.
New York looks like a great brand lol
welcome to the Communist Revolution
"Social media and city leaders, and politicians are winning in the destruction of America. Americans with half a brain, I believe will take matters into their own hands when it starts affecting them personally."
"This is the reason why Trump will be President again, we need law and order"
What a scumbag city
That NYC mayor is dense.
blame it on social media
Its really creepy that the democrats all sound the same when speaking.... always slow and passive agressive.
"What's all the fuss
Boys being boys"
"People act like these young fools lack free will. With that said, it stems from bad upbringing, and contrary to Fox analysts belief, a large percentage of their mostly one parent homes aren't working."
I hope Brandon Johnsons family members are a victim of a violent crime. I wonder what he would say about that
Breaking my heart. Haha
What a coward! These liberals don't have the balls to do what is necessary for the country.
Anyone trying to mob my vehicle will end up being washed from the undercarriage.
"This is why i dont go into NY anymore, i dont recommend visitors to spend their money by visiting either. Let the illiegal inmigrants and black kids take over the city and see how that works out for your leftist agenda."
oh look white people...oh wait
Same ol animals acting like animals
mobs.
Just hungry
"If you agree with anything these mayors and police chiefs say, you are a total fool, Fox news you are a bunch of Rhinos with a select few. Good grief!"
"A certain song is coming to mind
JS
Sad just sad! 
So much hate and anger 
People need to do better"
Too bad they dont have this kind of drive for demonstrations where our rights are being taken....at the same time grow up lol
How is she just going to ask about his tie and not acknowledge what he said
Worthless little animals
"There is one strong common denominator in this chaotic behavior normally perpetrated by impressionable sub-IQ criminals. From the African south to the American north, European west.....ONE. COMMON. DENOMINATOR.
It is irrefutable to any perspicacious mind."
When you don't have consequences for your actions then you have this crap go on.
That mayor has some mental issues to defend them
The black looters will get a pass and the Indians who own the 7-Eleven will go to jail.
Ok NYC COP. What happened? I know cop knows. You have your body cam. And your insite.
Oh America the Great!!. Slap the criminals on the wrist and punish law abiding Americans.
"Jan. 6th mostly white called 
criminals, these all black called misinformed youth. Double standerd anyone?"
"These historical, beautiful, cities are being trashed and ruined forever by these liberal leaders"
NY and Chicago mayors need to resign and let a real person take over. Chicago's mayor is the dumbest blind(no literally blind) person ive ever seen.
"Adams is a coward, Mayor Brandon is a coward. Obsolete fossils violating their own people through pandering enabling"
"When you focus on the good, the good gets better."
Mosty peaceful riots
They're not children you mayors are pieces of crap
Mayebw if new youk dodnt have so many melon heads!.
"Do they have parents, just wondering."
It's good vs. evil.
So I guess the parents will not be held accountable for what their bradley kids are doing. They should really put restrictions on cell phones and computers for teens and kids.
most of them have dark skin...says everything you need to know
NY MAYOR SEEMS HIGH?
"They're hungry, they can't get any food. It's an expression of their frustration. LOL!"
"TWO MORON  MAYORS, ARE THEY BLIND?"
If it was MAGA folks showing up and behaving like this the mayor would have a completely different opinion.
Game boy
smart phones don't help the situation
"bad school education, bad parenting."
"Notice the majority of the group...LOL An excuse to riot ""over PS5's""...LOL They all should be sent off to camps to be educated, there isn't even a ""re"" in that. Surround my suv like that and I'm putting the pedal down and plowing through. We will figure it out in court later"
That poor excuse of a mayor is dumber than BEETLEJUICE
This FOOL  is doing exactly what there blaming trump for hes bloody inciting riots and destruction of private and public property
No need to worry people...they are just large gatherings.
Why did he say game boys
The law of the jungle holds true !
"I dread to think what America will look like in another 10 years. Its going to eat itself from the inside out. You had it all guys, and you destroyed it."
"Now they riot in the daytime!
Bold lawlessness
I say equip 100 buses with handcuffs and go get them....process them at the local ball park stadium."
These situations are going to become more frequent. Soon these cities will be lawless wastelands.
"Which demographic is responsible? I have  no idea but they all look the same, must be cousins."
All Democrap fault.
The black mayors do not want to acknowledge the elephant in the room.
Typical liberal voters!
Saying look at all these black kids are not liberal at all. It's what is called the TRUTH!
Ever notice big city mayor's and state attorney's that don't have a clue about the rights of citizens and the law.
"And as we always see, the same African Americans taking part in the destruction. Nothing like destroying your own city."
Is outside agitators codeword for black fatherless teens?
"""'DemoQuacked""'...!!!(Citie$ Turned Neeedie$)...!!! Now Mayor'$ Throwing Fitttie$...!!! Getttofff your ""'HAMHOCK$""'...!!! NOW & ""'CLEANUP""'...!!! YOUR...!!!


""'NITTTY - GRITTTY'$""'...!!!

It was some white boys out there too tho
Oh a bunch of black teens acting like criminals and rabbid animals....nothing new to see here
"Because of BLM the marxists moved the criminals into  'office positions ' ,  now your reaping the rewards."
"DEAR FOX NEWS WATCHERS:
THE PERSON WHO CAUSED THIS RIOT BY HAVING A PLAYSTATION GIVEAWAY WAS ARRESTED IMMEDIATELY THE SAME DAY. WITHIN HOURS.

THE PERSON WHO CAUSED THE RIOT AT THE CAPITAL ON JANUARY 6TH HAS STILL NOT BEEN ARRESTED.

MORE PEOPLE DIED DURING THE JANUARY 6TH RIOT THAN THE NEW YORK ONE. 
THE NEW YORK RIOT WAS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT. 

WHY ARE THESE PEOPLE STILL NOT ARRESTED?"
"I THINK IT IS TRULY RACIST TO
INSINUATE A GROUP OF PEOPLE CAN'T PARTICIPATE IN SOME GOOD CLEAN FUN"
"""Hold on a second yo!"" It was someone from the outside. It must have been Putin, there's no doubt about it, YO!"
"""Hold on a second yo!"" These are not mobs of teenagers, these are gangs of pri-mates."
"Get over your semantics!!  They are baby Al Capones...Destructive, disrespectful, and devoid of the rule of law.  They should be prosecuted, and it the city of NY cared about its long term future, it would get it together and start enforcing the law.  You cannot blame Social Media, yes it is a contributing factor, but PARENTS and the LAW need to influence our kids and help them to understand ACCOUNTABILITY!!!"
I remember protesting the Iraq war in nyc and getting my face bashed in by police and taken to jail for not breaking the law at all. I watch this and look at these weak police not even able to handle teenagers.
Lol bringing Gameboys and smoke bombs
The color says it all
NEWS FLASH....THEIR PARENTS ARE PROMOTING THE BEHAVIOR OF THESE KIDS!
"This has been done on purpose where the mayors of the town allowed this thing to happen. We all know where it is thing is going, and I hope those young people will get a grip of knowledge. Did they destroyed it on life"
"These useless pro-criminal ""mayors"" giving these thugs a free pass to wreck the place are as much a problem as the mob themselves, There is a certain demographic which knows they can get away with anything and we are seeing a 24/7 Purge situation."
Black?
"Democrats do what Democrats do best, they lie and blame the innocent then punish the honest people."
"Founding fathers should have picked their own cotton. This country would be utopia compared to now. 
The only people that benefited from slavery are the people we see in this mob."
Call it what it is . Large gatherings of Blk people
"Yall need a mob of old school grandmother's with belts and switches walking the streets. No home training, not concern for consequences. Where are these people's parents! Where is the village that will check you if they seen you acting up, then send you home to be dealt with again by your parents."
Keep voting blue no matter who remember New York has a brand to maintain
HE NEEDS TO BE FIRED BLACK PEOPLE THESE RATING TRASH NETWORK LIKE CARLSON THE WHOLE TRASH CAST NEED BE LETGO
demoturds are cancerous cyst to Americans
A lot of racial diversity in these mobs isnt there?
Keep electing idiots this is what you get. Don't complain.
Game boys lol
"0:42  well, evidence says otherwise.
1:09 BETA!"
"My lord education and social influence including these so called psychological experts gentle approach to discipline and rule of law and respect has lead to this.

Reap what you sow (western world)

Same thing is happening in the uk (London, regent st)"
"Now what if you simply changed the location of where these ""gatherings"" happened, like the mayors front lawn or even better, the mayor's mothers front lawn.  Would the authorities react differently?   The answer is... yes, yes they would."
"Lord bring all the culprits to justice, may they be charged and locked up!"
"Please tell me this isn't reality. If these mayors had a set of testicles, they'd bring in outside influencers called WATER CANNONS! they are limp and useless"
This is just more proof that N.Y. is a failed state who believe they control the entire country.
You ALL are no longer parents......YOU SHOULD HAVE TO TAKE A TEST TO PROCREATE
I think those 7-11 employees were being very restrained.
They're all holding up their free Obama phones. Free social media to the idiots came from OBAMA.
you get what you voted for. Start holding them responsible for their actions. IE charge them
Try that in a small town
you get what you vote for!
"The Chinese government has monopolized online media! It's time to take action now! Come on, friends, let's make our voices heard offline! Let's make a change! Change this unfair world!"
The democrats need to be erased from the US! They are the most stupid and incompetent people ever.
Was right with you until you included january 6th.....did Paul Ryan and FOX write that part in ????????????
"Just a good group of kids, being kids!!!!!"
Lol...these two mayors and the perps seem to have something in common
The five idoits.
That seven eleven will get burned down. Because the village raised a bunch of animals
"Where has he been?  Social media was never supposed to replace parents. Calling out SM as if it cause the problem, that many of us have criticized for years feels like deflection."
"Pitiful absolutely Pitiful.....blame it on outsiders,blame it on anything else other than taking responsibility for this...."
"quote: ""You gotta arrest  people, you gotta prosecute people. You gotta put people in jail that deserve to be in jail."" --- Good luck with that!"
Mostly peaceful protest lol....this looks very firmiliar
The stupidity of Adams and Johnson on full display.
Dems want this. Civil war.
Anti-fa the actual fascists
Not hard to see who it is.
Oh. my demons- cratssssss
THEY need to be held accountable . Doing wrong is wrong . But you get what you vote for
"What an idiot! Keep defending the criminals! You voted for them! For those who didn't, I am so sorry you have to live like this! Stay safe!"
Got to love Dems
Antiva Da! They are getting paid to riot. DA!
Very diverse peacefull group.
Free Gameboys!
Fox is a joke not wanting to take action and just coward in their office to only talk about it like high school girls in the cafeteria.
Diversity is our strength
A large unruly gathering is a mob however you want to spin it. Wake up!!
Anything but that Epstein list and Hunter Biden huh? Lol
America is a joke at this point
But they're right this is the behavior you'd expect from a group of black kids
These thugs worthless violent mobs need to pay for their actions.
Saying that kids turned out to be brats because they didn't get the latest playstation USED to be a joke. We can all imagine that this riot has been deliberately caused and funded by those anonymous people who are not to be mentioned or investigated.
Got to fight fire with fire !!
Brandon Johnson is a joke.  Nothing will get better in Chicago with this guy.  Nothing.  I do feel sorry for the people who didn't vote for him though.
This is the result of a system that reduced the ability of father's to be involved in their children's lives as a whole on a broad society.
I notice race wasn't mentioned at all...
This mayor is disconnected from reality..
See how it progress and we have seen it so many times throughout history. Question is who do you think is going to push the button ?  Wake up America!!
"All of these mayors and governor's  disgust me. 
Who cares if there were agitators. Lol! Unbelievable."
"Oh, dear lord. He's continuing to forgive every monsterous thing they do as their lazy parents did. So many sociopaths have been born in the last 30 years. I actually predicted  this. 

Time to discipline these brats with water hoses. Easy solution. You start off soft with a warning. 

I don't understand why this social unrest is allowed. It has become such an uncivilized society because of poorly raised young adults."
"See, if you make crime legal, then crime statistics go down"
"I moved from NY last month, the best decision ever"
Hahahaha
Lock these kids and discipline them including their mayors!
ARREST ALL INFLUENCERS if this is the outcome!
Large gathering lol he is only saying that because 80 % of theses people were black
The man beaten has to be the one to file charges
They bring stuff cuz they are trouble makers!
Idiots!
Johnston is a nighmare he makes Beetlejuice look like a winner
Just another day of TNB
"Well done liberals. You brought Africa and the rest of the third world to civilizations that Europeans built. Bravo! Give yourself a round of applause! In fact, give yourselves a pat on the back, too. You deserve it!"
"It's the MAAAAAGA REPLUBLICANS, it's always the fault of the MAGA REPUBLICANS LOL. The woke left doesn't have anyone left to blame."
"I'm 40. When i was young, we only being called out to make a silly dance in a flash or a silly pose.."
We can blame Trump !!
"So he incited a riot, will he be indicted? no? only Trump? gotcha."
Laguar knows a bout telling
"Bleeps, proving once again, they are nothing but animals."
"In my day, we handled disappointment differently.  If we didn't there were consequences."
It's people like him that give the signal for them to do anything they want and no one will get arrested
"This is evidence of failed parenting, pure and simple.  Single parents are raising wild animals with no moral compass, destined to get shot sooner or later."
All I see is low income activities taking place..
The cops beat the crap out of me one night for running a red light  and hauled my but to jail .this is a bunch of bs .punish these animals .
"A black mayor, black police chief, and a black politician. All failures."
"I'm from another country, just wondering why are they all African American?"
I don't trust anyone who wears sunglasses when speaking to the public
"How about arresting the ""influencers"" that are instigating these ""large gatherings""? Used to be a law prohibiting inciting. And, those ""officials"" are some of the dumbest creatures on the planet. It is becoming obvious that these riots are part of their plan."
Start upholding the law and this crap will stop ..
Any mayor neglecting his or her duty should be jailed
"Ha!! The amount of mental gymnastics and projection they're doing here. Sure, they only want to be seen as individuals when it benefits them. But who was doing the grouping during Trump's campaign and presidency? Right wing conservatives. Projection at it's finest."
How did this man become Mayor of New York
Influencer = jobless f*ck nuggets!
National guard and salt pellets
Build back better!
"Insanity.... as if ""nice language"" is going to magically fix everything? are these people serious? Shouldn't these politicians get put into prison for allowing this? Why is it ok for Local politicians to allow crime of all sorts..... ruin the city? Im not going anywhere near NYC or any other city like this. Who is? so its self destructing and why is no one liable? Its sad, scary and disgusting all in one."
"A cop will gun a 5 yrs old if there's no orange tip on the barrel of it's toy gun, but buy god they won't call them looter's!      Ok who is selling crack cocaine to the government employees again?!!!"
I don't see any Asian or white protestors there....
The left used social media to control  the election and people's actions 7 year's now it's turning on them
Doea it wvwn matter if theyre from the oitsode or locals! OMG people. Theyre thugs no matter where they came from. Thwyre criminals..period!!!!!
Its so disappointing you cant even go to the city anymore and feel safe.
Honestly cant stand these people in charge in NY!!
That's regardless you still need to take the teenagers and teach them a lesson so it doesn't happen again remember free pass is saying just go do it and everything's fine our parents would have told us if we would have done much lies than what I have seen going on lately
FAUX News is worthless!
God forbids things that deny AGW and support pathological-liars from posting comments. Amen.
Mells loke B. S.  To me.
Why does it support Trump? List five reasons.
Yeah... BLM. Solved it.
These leftist are using the Intel and police agencies to go after the patriots and citizens on the right! Yet the left can commit any crime and they thems4lves disregard and break the rules of law and these Intel and protection agencies do nothing to protect the citizens! These are the type of things thatve been occurring in countries under communist control for the last 70+yrs. You morons don't seem to realize the danger of what's going on or are too cowardly to even talk about it!
"These criminals are not children. They are acting
 like adult imbeciles who are demonstrating their violence and total disregard for law and order."
What's wrong with u pepl?
Smallpox is very contagious within the Russian trenches and would be safe to use in Ukraine once the Ukrainian soldiers have been vaccinated. While this does not remove the threat of mines it does stop artillery barrages as all the Russian crews are infected with smallpox.
"Marxists destroying US through their slaves. All this people must be deported and their citizenship remived. They hate US,. must go."
"The driving instructor has to take driving classes and he was in the right place! He can sign up right there, if they let him! He's a menace!!!"

They haven't made Game Boys since the late 90s....just saying what a Boomer.
All Part of there plan
"AGITATORS,,, to blame,,,,   you mean agitators like the FBI types during 6th Jan?"
I live in Massachusetts I could care if they tear the whole city down to could I could care less long as they stay there let him stay where they are keep them out of Massachusetts
Who cares
"Look B. We're not talking about Omaha because the people protesting are in DC and that's what's being discussed! You commies are creating chaos in this country leading to the final takeover! Should they bring in nature. Guard? We must remember they have a police dpt. Who should be doing their work! Why aren't they? The left are totally responsible for this. But is it wise to bring in natl. Guard? Remember they follow orders of those in power. What happened with the military in  Afghanistan? They were given bad orders apparently purposely by the enemies on the left or handlers or whatever! This thing about the left using police, military or Intel agencies remind me of these dictators using military against the people in military coups! Could they be doing this to bring natl. Guard into DC on an election year to use against the citizens if they lose? Or if the 2020 thing repeats itself?"
This kind of spoiled people only happens in this country. We the only country that would riot over video games.
This is what happens when black Marxists run anything. Look at South Africa.
"C'mon now, tell the truth, it's a summer of love ,fun,  merriment, and bringing the community together."
What about this citizen in Salt Lake city killed by the fbi for supposedly making threats against him? How many people made threats against Trump and no one moved a finger? What about the leftist leaders who've gone around threatening the right and having people go to their homes to insult them and even try to hurt them?
"Parents, this is what happens when you don't paddle your kids' behind when they get out of line as children. Doing so instills that bad behavior has painful consequences, acceptable behavior nets rewards. These ingrained lessons are carried into adulthood. No, I'm not condoning child abuse, that is an entirely different and unloving act."
Influencers of Liberals
"Is this another example of the people in the city taking care of their own people, you know, like try that in a small town? I'll bet Whoopi would stand up for these people too they're just taking care of their own."
Mob just be honest
They are hoods and thugs
Yeah I would be mad if I didn't get a gameboy SP with either pokemon crystal or megaman battle chip network 3 for my birthday too!!!
THATS HOW WE TAME CARE OF BUSINESS IN STOCKTON.
"It is the inside influences pal, the climate of D dynamic of lying, cheating, and ignoring the laws."
Cmon fix the taxes for the working ppl no way mynsyate needs 250$ a week from me and this is what happens. Start fixing the country the right way please
"They are idiots,that's for sure, sad to say the Mayor is an idiot to because instead of doing his job ,he is backing them because the majority are black kids,it is what it is ,they are lost kids that need Jesus"
"Is that a riot?  I thought it was an episode of ""Walking Dead"" and Rick Grimes was driving the SUV."
"Large Gatherings 
Mostly Peaceful"
Who cares what happens in foreign cities like Chicago or New York? Fox should focus on American news taking place on American soil.
"These incidents are NOT ""agitators from the outside""  These are the way the kids have been raised to behave both from the PARENT and THE JUSTICE SYSTEM that REFUSES to hold these Punks RESPONSIBLE for their actions."
The racist is GUTLESS When you see a group of people you see black kids
Watch the mob videos with your eyes who is it? who is it? It's gonna take grown ups to fix this.Eric Adam's ain't nothing but an incompetent fool. Clean up your steets eric.Rudy did.
Someone should send in the National Guard. To stop that mess. And find who started or promised play stations. And arrest them.
"I always wanted to come to America for a holiday, but I think I'll pass on that now."
You allow this. Live with it
"These mayors are blind. Some of today's young people are ""like Al Capone."" It is mob mentality, it is kids who are local to the area and organized via social media. To ignore that is foolish."

We are reaching levels of cultural enrichment previously thought to be impossible.
I thought Eric Adams would be an ok mayor but he's a disappointment
liberals are racist and most of them don't even realize it
"I wouldn't live in NYC or Chicago if I were given a free residence and support money.  Gutfield is wrong, in that there is a bad black youth subculture at work under which gangsters are glorified, black students who do well in school are said to be ""acting white"", violence (especially gun violence) is promoted, women are degraded, and whites are demonized.  Add to this the fact that liberal city governments are holding back law enforcement, coddling the wildlings, and black activists are pushing black entitlement.  Until these elephants in the room are addressed, especially by black leadership and the black community; and law and order are reinstated; liberal-run, Democratic cities such as NYC and Chicago will continue to descend into violence and ruin."
What a numb nutz for a mayor!!!!
"These kids have adopted the democrat values. They are becoming the ""mostly peaceful"" mobs the dems loved so much in the recent past."
Eric Adams isn't going to do anything for you. You'll get it eventually.
Please apply this framing to jan 6.
amercan s need to see how other countries kids are educated. i went back home and the kids smarter than collage kids here.  they working or preparing for the future they know they politics they read news paper . shocking because this is your future.
"Telling me I need to watch my language, words, he can stick it & rotate on it!"
thats the mayor.??  children.? i give up good luck.
"Thereve been a few takeovers and military coups all over the planet in the last 3yrs since 2020 starting with ??? I forget all the countries, the latest I believe is niger."
To hurt other people because someone else did you wrong is idiocy. It's not these people's fault you were scammed by an influencer.
You are responsible for your own actions Mr Mayor. These teens are responsible for their actions too. Arrest these thugs and charge them!
Why is it all black kids? Is it BLM pushing these or something? It's not coincidence it's all black kids
No wonder there's terror they got Nikko Jenkins runnin things out there
Kudos to the 7-11 employees for beating the living daylights out of the thug.
They get away with everything.
"They act like Animals, TREAT THEM LIKE ANIMALS."
How much for Leonardo flyier?
Lock them up. Throw away the KEY!!!
People are so concerned with racism. Does anyone really think that behaving like _this_ is going to eliminate it?
They should get into sothebys Franchise and say we ARE un-Movable
"i'm from Europe and have a theoretically questions WOULD USA BE BETTER OF IF IN USA WOULD BE ONLY 5 % BLACK AND 95% WHITE MOSTLY PROTESTANTS? I have never beein in US, but this question comes automaticaly"
"Yes you dipshiite soyboy, Outside Agitators from Outside the Country you welcomed here AND the useless sacks of layabout shiite left in NYC after anyone who could leave did.   CrapHole!"
The mayor of NY reads at a 5th grade level. Nothing worse than someone dumb trying to sound intelligent
"These fools running your cities , you fools who voted for them"
"Those children are  killing peoples ,both those mayors are waist of space"
This should not be tolerated. It was a prize giveaway and they decided to turn it into a riot. Lock up anyone who's directly causing trouble or at least give them a short term criminal record.
Unlike these heathensn Al Capone actually did some good in his community and was respected by the people.
"More cultural enrichment and diversity, inclusion, and equity vomit. They are not teenagers, they are black teenagers .... all of them."
They all blame something else like social media or outside agitators but they never but blame on themselves. They never say it's our fault because our law enforcement is to laxed and to thin to do much good. Should have brought in the national guard if u can't control your own city you don't have a city.
7-11 shop employee deserves a raise
New York and Chicago mayors are pu-ssies.
"Outside influence, can't be our own blk youth  ! Your problem is there are videos of blk violence and everyone but the liberals see it for what it is  !"
"Kids ??? Do u still call them kids ?? Those are evils, it's clear that those kids are gonna be criminals in the futur with a unique  goal in life is to terrorise people in the streets ..plz save america, those people are getting out of controle"
Consequence free culture has led to this.
They charged Trump for telling everyone to be peaceful and go home on Jan 6th. So I suppose we'll see the online influencer who's responsible for openly inciting violence being arrested...right???
"Disgusting, God then my father would have been my frar if I fid this as a teenage ""kid"".  These ""kids' are dangerous!"
Colin Flaherty
Outside influences I don't think so. You got enough fugs in that city to more than make up for these. Gangsters
"boys will be boys, hey mayor"
"THIS IDIOT TALKING HERE SAYS IM SURE THERE ARE GOOD KIDS IN THE MOB CORRECTION THERE ARE NO GOOD KIDS THAT ARE IN A MOB
 GOOD KIDS WALK AWAY WHEN THEY SEE A MOB FORMING."
"Spank those naughty children! Spare the rod, spoil the child"
You need to bring back national service if they want to fight get them in the army
"I thought New Yorkers were tough and had balls, turns out they don't. You deserve who you vote for."
"Let us know the addresses just city, state, and race of those arrested, that will tell you who lives in NYC and who came from outside. Very easy to prove mayor Adams, as a former police officer you should know that evidence is stronger than your BS theories."
"The outside influences that caused this was a black guy who put these free  promises on the internet. The black mayor does not address this at all ""why Not"" because its a black person that caused this whole fiasco. Put this black guy in prison."
Da mayr he be lookin into it
How do you know these are teens?... There are more obvious traits that could be used to describe these criminals!
Just look at those non-descript teens!
It is bad parenting kids can be gullible and more influence by social media back in my day we had no cell phone or tv
Put crimals in jail!
"Teenagers the same age as those ""kids"" would have been seasoned soldiers fighting in wars in years gone by.  Maybe calling them ""kids"" is part of the problem...!"
"These kids today are so spoiled. They are lazy, disrespectful and have never worked a day in their life. I grew up in East Texas and we worked the farm, cattle, pastures and whatever needed to be done. WHITE PEOPLE TEACH THEIR KIDS TO WORK AND I'M PROUD TO BE ONE OF THEM."
"Thats why the police needs to arrest there
Parents if thay are 
Under age."
Dirtbag Democrats always blaming the innocent
Of course he's making excuses for the new Confederate army marching through the streets. They don't want US to fight back. And this time the Dixiecrats will take the country without having to fire a shot. They're using street thugs and criminals to do it for them.
"Are you kidding me, our kids are so messed up because we're messing them up as a nation... I mean God sum people are stupid.."
All these people in the street's did nothing wrong. Blame it in some outsiders haha
THAT MAN NEEDS TO JOIN SANITATION DEPARTMENT
Black teens? I saw black and Hispanic.
Spair the rod spoil the child
Voting has consequences. N.Y. has decended into a cesspool. Typical demoRAT run city.
"HAS ANYBODY DECIDED WHAT COLOR THESE PEOPLE ARE??  Maybe ask The big Whoopi...I""M pretty sure she can sort all this out....don't u think??  Stand bye people...stand bye..................just be ready to blame somebody.....!!!"
Liberal side effect
Should be delt with right away
Ya blame social media!!! Dummies
They should not charge the 7 11 guys!!!! Put the thieves in jail!!!!
its funny watching these guys try and do crime while holding there pants up. That's why you need people to control you because you cant control your selves.
Stop making excuses for these young adults they are old enough to know the difference between right and wrong. These are criminals point blank. They should be charged just like we would be. We have to stop this MOBS from doing this. Arrest them and if found guilty go to jail just like we would be.
"Thank you very much. We are all humans.  No, more  excuses.  We skin color  people, some of us  are perfect beings in the world, times for disciplinary.they have using skin color as an excuse and slavery to get away with real crimes. especially the one who was born raised here in America. Some of them are very selfish and disrespectful, and they are very orrogant. We all created by God's image. There's no black God or White God. One God's for ounce. Jesus loves all of us the same way."
"Hmm, it always seem to be folks of a certain ethnicity that commit these violent acts."
Only in Biden's America
Good kid resist violence.
Laws protect crimnals. The worst parenting in recorded history. Ive given up on this country.
Going after the guy guys...  Too bad then...  that the 7 Eleven employees didn't use a sledge hammer..!! Might as well make it worth it!!
mayor lips has no idea the danger of socialism -
Hes a twitch streamer no? People dont typically know the twitch ones
It's called Wilding!
"Lawlessness! Read your Bible, everyday!"
Maybe allot of them are ex-BLM?
"That mayor Brandon is speaking in such a  calm and soothing voice, like all is fine and those are just kids playing, no harm done.

I wonder, if he would get a call and was told that hundreds of those well mannered kids are attacking his house by throwing bricks, smashing windows and vandalizing he's property doing god knows what else, would he maintain the same soothing voice and calm face and continue talking that cra*p he was talking?

If you will allow these kids (16-17? not really kids) to behave like this and go unpunished, potentially they will become criminals and thugs. Just because you allowed them to do whatever they want. And the first to blame for it will be the people like this useless mayor.

PS. GOOD FREAKING JOB on these 7/11 workers beating the sh*t out of a burglar with a stick :D not everything is lost."
Democrat run cities and states only
Wow I can't believe in this day and age they can't get footage of these thugs and do a daytime visit and charge them it's done for the football hooligans in the UK dawn raids and they are arrested why on earth are they getting a pass
Time to build prisons right in  their communities so you can just lock them up and wait until their court dates come up in 5 to 10 yrs.
Idiots making excuses for animals
"Where there are Africans, there is Africa"
"'teens', 'young people'......yeah, ok"
They are not large gaverings they are hoodlums who are rioting and destroying property.they are jumping on cars to break out the glass.they are running around like wild animals.
Hey New York your mayor sucks
All black ! Say the truth
This is what black culture looks like! Enjoy it NYCb
They not getting their values or discipline at home either!
You mean like what they did on January 6! Set up with antifa and other people to cause the problems
The parents are working? Yea right. Most likely on welfare.
I'll say it over and over... This is a cultural issue.
"Union square is a rich neighborhood and a large crowd of people causing trouble 
This type of thing is never going to happen again"
You all did not want the police or courts
The kids do no respect the rights of other
Donald did it. And nothing happened to him. Oh but he is white.......
Call them what they are mob rioters mostly black. Typical.
"Attention New York! To all those New Yorkers who vote democrat, did you really expect anything different?"
"In some countries they cane you as punishment for stealing , in others they cut off your hands !"
These large gatherings are mob rioters. And they need Riot Control Cops to forcibly remove and arrest them.
how many fathers are even in their lives?
"if the mayors have these thugs that smashed cars go after THEM, they wouldn't make excuses"
"Just wait til the rest of us stop putting up with this. If our own government doesn't go by the rules, why should we. Purge. We should vote on that. January 1st.  Every year. Purge."
White teens killed a thousand of people you found thousands of excuses for them to killing black people now you talk about excuses
That camera man knows it looked like that dude was wereing one of those activist hoodies for that pink group they are ccp funded Adams might just be right.
"The question is why when a Black people are victims they need to protest to found justice, when white people are victims they don't need to protect to find justice"
Mostly black kids and black mayors forgiving the looting and destruction. I think the kids are lacking in enough positive influence in their lives and enough positive things to do. It's not a black thing. It's not a race thing. It's just how it's going right now.
"Its funny that all the kids are black, its funny how there the victims, but they are the criminals"
The way these politicians talk is cheap shows they cannot handle what they are elected for no excuse and deal with it bring criminals to Justice
My dad would have beat my azz if i acted like these thugs. I guess that is the difference.
NYC cops are the worst
This is Democrats during good times wait until SHTF in major cities it will be too hostile to be outside to even forage for food.
Why do people acting in self defense always get investigated but the crazies rioting are given passes?
Glad I visited NYC before the immigrants and ninjas took over.
I thought New Yorkers we're anti gun tree huggers?
"another reason why i would never live in a city, i'll stick to my woods and racoons"
Democrat voters
Water cannons would clean the streets of the garbage quickly.
"Age does not matter, a threat is a threat. You're not protecting anyone calling it something else."
The consequences for voting for open borders politicians. This is another countries problem.
Oh fox
Seems to be a giant elephant of color in the room
Same speech as mayor David Dinkins
Gameboys this dude is stuck in 2001
DemocRats are full of donkey she/it... and disco still sucks
It was an insurrection.
Can we agree that this guy is a boner in the locker room?  Was this chowderhead the mayor of Chicago at one time?  I'm gonna go start a riot.  I'm in Oregon so I can.
Just getting ready for 2024 elections. Nothing else to see folks.
Both mayors are absolute fools! Ridiculous response from both idiots. Ignoring the crimes of rioters.
"These kids need Jesus Christ of Nazareth Isreal. Please lord forgive them, for they know not what they do."
"""The five"" are the rights version of Don Lemon and Rachel Maddow."

New York Crazy
New Portland

It was a consumer riot.
Will they hunt them down like the J6 crowed
Not only are the oceans too hot to absorb CO2 they are already too acidic due to CO2 saturation that they can no longer support life; and the rain-forests are no longer absorbing CO2 either. Which is why global-warming is accelerating and insures our extinction by the year 2060 due to the AGW creating the refugees at the southern border.
"All ""those white kids are so criminal oriented. 
Oh, wait... they are not white, are they?"
"Here's an excellent and productive way to quickly discipline these heathen kids and turn them into Respectable MEN.... ANYONE 16-18 years old caught rioting or looting should be ""Automatically sentenced"" to 12 weeks at Parris Island -- Marine Corps Boot Camp AND followed by 6 months technical training !!!"
This will only happen until we have been completely exhausted and cant take it anymore. Until then we can pop some popcorn and lets the ziosoros's fund this bs

"*Paragraph 1 of 11.*      _IPCC: Window to avert catastrophic climate change is quickly closing_ April 4, 2022 This news article is from _Fox News._ The _Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change_ on Monday released its latest report, which found that nations are falling short of their pledges to reduce greenhouse g@s emissions in order to avert catastrophic climate change. While the technology exists to stay below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) of average global temperature increase.   X3"
"*Paragraph 5 of 11.*     _IPCC: Window to avert catastrophic climate change is quickly closing_ Global emissions are at their highest level in history: 54% higher than in 1990, and 12% higher than they were in 2010. Emissions growth slowed from 2.1% per year in the 2000s to 1.3% annually in the 2010s. The pathway to averting catastrophe is now clear and technologically feasible: Rapidly redesign the power sector to rely on renewable energy, switch transportation and heating to electric systems, and capture the carbon dioxide from the smokestack in the hardest-to-decarbonize sectors such as cement and steel production. For the situations where that is unfeasible, such as air travel, carbon emissions can be offset with the emerging technology of actually removing carbon from the atmosphere."

People will blame the party in power for the Mississippi River and Colorado Rivers drying up causing food and fuel inflation of another 15%. *And Democrats will loose the 2024 election to some runaway-AGW-denying wacko.* That cannot be made to understand that AOC had the word abortion removed from the KKKible; and Satan lied to it when He told it abortion was wrong."
"List five things the the best jobs creating president in American history has done that it disagrees with? Did legally-elected president Joe Biden cause the Mississippi River and Colorado Rivers to dry up?

"*Paragraph 1 of 4.*    _Thanks to climate change, vegetable prices have soared 40% in the U.S._ December 9, 2022 This news article is from _Yahoo News._ *Vegetable prices in the United States were up nearly 40% in November over the previous month,* according to new figures from the _Labor Department,_ and climate change is one of the reasons why. In California, an ongoing drought that studies have shown has been been exacerbated by climate change, has led to $3 billion worth of agriculture losses in a state that grows much of the nation's food. The megadrought, which covers much of the American West, has forced cuts in the amount of water that states like California and Arizona receive from the Colorado River. That has left tomatoes to wither on the vine, and lettuce to shrivel."
"*Paragraph 3 of 4.*   _Thanks to climate change, vegetable prices have soared 40% in the U.S._ The long-term climate change trend in California, however, is causing the state's government to take action. In August, California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced an $8 billion plan aimed at increasing the state's water supply and ""adapting to a hotter, drier future."" ""We are experiencing extreme, sustained drought conditions in California and across the American West caused by hotter, drier weather,"" a policy outline released by the governor's office stated. ""Our warming climate means that a greater share of the rain and snow fall we receive will be absorbed by dry soils, consumed by thirsty plants, and evaporated into the air. This leaves less water to meet our needs."""
"*Paragraph 4 of 4.*   _Thanks to climate change, vegetable prices have soared 40% in the U.S._ *The negative farming impacts in California from climate change are much the same story in Arizona,* which provides more than 9% of the country's leafy greens during the winter months, _Bloomberg_ reported. The combination of the drought and Colorado River water cuts have severely affected the growing season, and more cuts are coming in the new year. In August, the federal government announced that water deliveries to Arizona would be reduced by another 20%, starting in January of next year. ""Prolonged drought is one of the most profound issues facing the U.S. today,"" Tommy Beaudreau, assistant secretary of the interior, said in announcing the cuts. In Florida, the top supplier of fruits and vegetables in the U.S. during autumn and winter, Hurricane Ian caused up to $1.9 billion in damages to the state's agricultural industry, hitting orange and tomato crops particularly hard. *Studies have shown that Ian was wetter and more intense as a consequence of climate change.*"

During that time, thousands of African-Americans were killed by domestic terrorists like the Ku Klux Klan who tried to reinforce antebellum policies of white supremacy.

The Republicans in Louisiana had called for the Convention, as they were angered by the legislature's enactment of the *Black Codes and its refusal to give black men the vote.*"

"Fox News, it's Kind of called stereotyping. This is what a lot of People Look at, stereotyping Like for instance a lot of security companies such as certain names I won't mention And certain employees do it as well because they're not well-trained. They are unprofessional. Stereotyping is used throughout the whole United States. Just because a person dresses different than the other different. They assume hes a criminal. Which it might be that the person is probably Wealthy Educated experienced has knowledge. Without a doubt. But a lot of people stereotype because out of the way people dress. For instance, I walked to a target with holy shoes and a shirt. That's a little bit older. It might have A few fade or holes, shorts, Dickie shorts, black brown. Socks all the way to the knees. And these security guards had a target that I Shop around, let's say a certain city in the city of Torrance, California. There is a few targets there And when I walk in, there is security guard. Right away at the door of the entrance Assuming i'm gonna steal something Right away, now that is judging a person. No, what does that say in a Bibl Thou shall not judge, But of course, a lot of people don't know the bible And I am not judging, but this is the problem we have in America. Where people are good to stereotype and then it becomes A big mess in social media. And then everything gets entangled. But stereotype it's one of the big Problems America has especially in the security community. As soon as we see somebody walking, that doesn't look properly. We automatically judge, but it shouldn't be that way. Because we don't know that person. A security's job is to observe and Report and at the Torrance target in calthornya. Have security guards that love to stereo type? Give it a try. Fox News walk in there one day, holy and you will see. And I mean, with drags and see what happens. Great job is always fox news thank you for bringing it to everyone's attention"

"*Paragraph 2 of 5.*     _Walter Scott sh00ting: Michael Slager, ex-officer, sentenced to 20 years in prison_ Scott's mother, Judy, was one of seven family members who spoke before the sentencing. She recalled her 50-year-old son growing up as a ""happy, jolly child"" and then turned to Slager directly, telling him, ""I forgive you."" Slager began to cry. In his final statement before sentencing, the ex-officer said: ""I wish I could go back in time and change the events. But I can't. It's a very tragic situation. I'm standing before the Scott family and the court and taking responsibility for the actions of April 4, 2015."" Federal prosecutors had sought life in prison for Slager, who agreed to plead guilty in May to a federal charge of violating Scott's civil rights. That was in exchange for state prosecutors' dropping their case after a month-long murd*r trial ended in a hung jury a year ago. In that trial, Slager had faced 30 years to life in prison if convicted."
"*Paragraph 3 of 5.*       _Walter Scott sh00ting: Michael Slager, ex-officer, sentenced to 20 years in prison_ Slager's sentencing capped a winding case that followed other notable police-involved de@ths in Ferguson, Missouri; Cleveland; and New York, and it highlighted how rare it is for law enforcement officers to be convicted or to plead guilty in such incidents. A bystander captured the sh00ting of Scott on his cellphone, and the graphic video, which was viewed by the public millions of times, became a key piece of evidence for the prosecution. Scott, a father of four children, was stopped by Slager for a broken taillight. The cellphone video began recording after the stop, when the men were standing in a vacant lot. Slager fired eight shots at Scott as he ran away, striking him five times, including three in the back, a coroner later said. Even after he was shot, Slager handcuffed Scott's arms behind his back. Slager had claimed that Scott took control of his Taser and that he feared for his life in a scuffle after the traffic stop. The video didn't show Scott taking the stun gun. A co-worker of Scott's who was riding with Slager when he was pulled over told jurors that he didn't know why Scott ran. But Scott's family has suggested that it was because he owed back child-support payments and didn't want to be arrested."
"Out of control kids that have never been taught how to act.  Yet when one gets hurt, everyone portrays these kids as innocent.  It's the parents responsibility to teach these kids. Period !"

"*Paragraph 2 of 5.*    _Louisville police use excessive force, invalid warrants, discriminatory stops, and violated the constitution; DOJ review finds_ The review, conducted by the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, also found that police violate the rights of those ""engaged in protected speech critical of policing"" and that some officers used racial slurs about Black citizens. The city has reached an agreement in principle to resolve the constitutional violations found by federal investigators, the Justice Department said. The report is similar to those issued in several other cities, including Ferguson, Missouri, after the de@th of Michael Brown in 2014. The Trump administration backed away from federal investigations into unconstitutional policing, and the investigation into Louisville was announced early in the Biden administration, in 2021."

Want the U.S.A. to crumble?..... Being done DELIBERATELY by a coordinated TREASON TEAM."
"*Paragraph 3 of 5.*    _Louisville police use excessive force, invalid warrants, discriminatory stops, and violated the constitution; DOJ review finds_ The Louisville investigation came in the aftermath of the botched police raid that led to the de@th of Breonna Taylor in March 2020. Four Louisville officers were federally charged in August in connection with Taylor's de@th. DOJ's pattern-and-practice investigation was not a criminal probe, but rather looked at broader, systemic issues in the police department. ""Breonna Taylor was a symptom of problems that we have had for years,"" one Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD) leader told federal investigators. The report said that police officers' actions ""do not happen in a vacuum"" and noted that ""segregation, poverty, and violence"" affected policing in the racially segregated city. The police department, which is 81% white, was charged with patrolling neighborhoods that were predominately Black."
Vote blue this is what you deserve. I love it. Keep voting blue! You all deserve this!
"*Paragraph 4 of 5.*    _Louisville police use excessive force, invalid warrants, discriminatory stops, and violated the constitution; DOJ review finds_ The report notes that officers ""have difficult jobs"" and said that the LMPD and Louisville/Jefferson County Metro government ""have not given officers and other employees the support and resources they need to do their jobs effectively and lawfully,"" and that they had ""deficient training, substandard facilities and equipment, and inadequate support for mental health and wellness."" ""For years, LMPD has practiced an aggressive style of policing that it deploys selectively, especially against Black people, but also against vulnerable people throughout the city,"" the report states. ""LMPD cites people for minor offenses, like wide turns and broken taillights, while serious crimes like sexual assault and homicide go unsolved."" ""Some officers demonstrate disrespect for the people they are sworn to protect,"" the report continues. ""Some officers have videotaped themselves throwing drinks at pedestrians from their cars; insulted people with disabilities; and called Black people 'm0nkeys,' 'animal,' and 'boy.' This conduct erodes community trust, and the unlawful practices of LMPD and Louisville Metro undermine public safety."""
1:15 lets be honest this man refused to fail his homeschooled kids because he claimed the system was broke... the very system he built....
Outside agitators sound like conspiracy theorists.
Rioters are rioters.  Bring in the SWAT.
Somebody call the Montana and Texas militias. They had it right. Since the people we put in office can't seem to control or maintain perhaps it's time for a little vigilante justice. I'm just saying.
"They are mobs they are criminals , period say what it is quit candy coating these crimes"
"*Paragraph 2 of 5*     Attorney General Merrick Garland announced the findings Friday in Minneapolis, accompanied by Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Police Chief Brian O'Hara. ""As I told George Floyd's family this morning, his de@th has had an irrevocable impact on the Minneapolis community, on our country, and the world,"" Garland said. The Justice Department's civil investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department's practices began in April 2021, after former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin was convicted of murd*r in Floyd's de@th."
"*Paragraph 4 of 5*    _DOJ report finds Minneapolis police use ""dangerous"" excessive force and discriminatory conduct_ Federal investigators said the department conducts traffic and pedestrian stops against Black people 6.5 times more frequently than White people in the city, a rate only surpassed by enforcement activities against Native Americans, who are stopped at a rate of 7.9 times more than White people, when adjusted for their share of the population. And throughout the period during which the study was conducted, the department used force against Black people at 9 times the rate and against Native American people at 13.9 times the rate that it used force against White people, the investigation found. In all, according to the report, when compared to White people behaving in a similar manner in comparable circumstances, Black people in Minneapolis experience 24% more uses of force, 22% more searches, and 37% more vehicle searches. ""Though MPD has long been on notice about racial disparities and officers' failure to document data on race during stops, and was made aware of expressions of racial bias by some MPD officers and supervisors, MPD has insufficiently addressed these issues,"" the report alleged. The Justice Department's review also criticizes the excessive and unlawful use of force by police throughout the city, even in situations when race appeared not to be a factor. ""For years, MPD used dangerous techniques and weapons against people who committed at most a petty offense and sometimes no offense at all. MPD used force to punish people who made officers angry or criticized the police,"" the report said. Approximately 75% of the Minneapolis Police Department's reported uses of force ""did not involve an associated violent offense or a weapons offense,"" according to the Justice Department. One example highlighted in the report involved an unarmed White woman who was shot and killed by an officer in 2017 after she approached his vehicle and ""spooked"" him. That officer was convicted of manslaughter and the city paid the woman's family $20 million."
