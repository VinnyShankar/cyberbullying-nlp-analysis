Good for 3rd
"I absolutely love this team! Youth, chemistry, and raw potential. The future of the NBA is today!"
USA listing this year smh
We definitely not winning gold
"USA better get used to second/third place, Team Canada and the European countries are the new powerhouses now"
Go sir Jalen And for Usa
Know who else wore 10 on the US team? Represent it well Ant
"This is African team, only 1 Anglosaxon and 1 European"
France is winning the cup
Team could have been so much better
bro AE looking like MJ when he is smiling
They gonna get their Asses torn up!
"Lmao definitely C team - KD, Lebron, AD, Harden, Jimmy, Beal, Booker, Curry, Fox, Sabonis(born in Portland) , Ja, Demar, Zach, 
Etc etc."
I dont know but USA still so stacked at this point they will win it all again
Great value USA team
I dont need to see the other teams to know its an L
This is a b+ team
Canada has a much better line-up
"damn this is the usa team?? I can understand Brunsom, Edwards,  and maybe Reaves.. but everyone are shadows. Cant wait to see Reaves grow from this lol next season gonna be fun."
Edwards got some MJ bloodline
Where's Bron or kd steph ja
Yo this is a bad and good team
Hi.
Another bronze for team USA...
"14 is like ""I'm the Christian Laettner"""
New generation
atleast we got ant
No Jokic on Serbia... Doncic injured for Slovenia... No excuses for the USA not to win.
Is that fucking walker kessler up there? Bro got 1 invincible card now he think he invincible
Man our team usa team looks kinda soft
Great this US team is built off of rookies and bench riders ..damn the silver and gold medal these mfs finna get put out in the first game
Italy will whoop your ass for sure
"These young college players must prove their bashers wrong! And hopefully drafted soon. Carry on, Team USA (B)"
AR15
Might be the weakest team USA of the last 40 years
Josh hart? Really?
"Team wasn't diverse enough, need more white."
Don't sleep!!!
There is no austin reaves? Come on..
Austin Reeves the MVP
This squad trash we definitely taking an L
"Who the heck are these guy lol? Too many attack scorer out there. Dream team, redeem team, these guys are the Nameless Team."
Nexs dream team
All NBA Bench.
Zion needs to be out there. This is ridiculous
Dont know any of these kids usa aint going anywhere
"Yall average basketball fans don't understand DEFENSE. This is the ALL-NBA Defense Team USA squad. Defense and rebounds first, the scoring will take care of itself. The weak links on most Team USA rosters since the Athens disgrace have been TOO MANY WINGS and SCORERS, not enough defense and boards. That will NOT be a problem with this team."
Reaves gonna be clutch
Hmmmmm....
This the weakest USA team since college players man. Damm
Theres no way this is our us team.......like theres some nice players.  But like wtf is this?!
Happy b-day ant
Bro where thr fuck can we watch the fiba basketball tournament and when? Ive been asking this shit everytime and no one responds
LETS GO REAVES!!!
Canada team enters the chat.
"Cam johnson the dark horse, hes gonna shoot the leather off this ball."
Gives me Bronze vibes?!
You seen that MF Bobby??
If this team USA then we lost
Ant
This is literally our C team.
Austin reaves look so left out
Damn only one potential future hall of fame player in this roster
idk if this team gonna win even once
Paolo Banchero is a traitor!!!
"i guess i dont watch enough nba,
but who is #6 & #14?"
We loosing every game!!
canada breakfast is served
Probably gonna get slaughtered
"Bruh im old (33) everyone had retired.
The new generation is here."
Let's go JJJ!!!
Man they fina get they ass kicked
This is not a gold medal shoe-in squad.
ant looking like jordan
Yeah the gone be in 3rd place
I want the old USA
I think Paolo is Italian guy
Ingram looks scary

Great team go get that gold
"Man I'm not impressed, this is like our E team representing"
AR 15
BRANDON INGRAM MADE ITTTTT!!!
All role player
they gonna lean on brunson
lets go Bronze
"A strong team,maybe  6th place"
Good look for this USA team
maybe 4th place is enough for this line up not full power
Why Bobby there?
Can we just hand them the trophy now and not waist anyone's time
Not gonna lie Canada team looks better lol
Need. Bigs. Legit Center and power forward
Soft
Nothing but perimeter players
Were cooked
They won't have a chance against teams like Slovenia. They play together for years and this is just a team with young raw diamands.
Give Brandon Ingram the ball.. game over
The USA B team
Good for 5th 6th 4th at best.
B players from america still better than any countries best.
jalen brunson is going to drop 30
Full villanova
Where bron curry Giannis Tatum embid jokic Kd
We n trouble mark my word!!
Is LeChina on team China?
BI and AE gone carry
Ant wearing 10 for Kobe
BOBBY BOBBY BOBBY!
Team USA JV team
Sure loss
I actually think this team will be really really good
"I know everyone but 14 and 6.

Who are they?"
lots of kobe PE's
what is this team for
not a big fan of those threads i like the older jerseys better like the 2012 and the 1992 ones
We are so DONE we are gonna get SMOKED do you know what it took USA to bringnhome the gold medal last year we had to send reinforcements
Man this squad is so young they will have a hard time adjusting to fiba rules and playstyle. France or Greece might take WC trophy
Only one white guy that racist
I think this team will be down hopefully they can make it to creat to win
We might be in trouble
my fav player out of there is cam johnson
Top 7
Is this the bench
"Brunson or edwards the best player there, that says enough."
Gotta be one of THE WEAKEST teams we have ever sent out there smh. Def not winning this one fellas
This just may be the weakest USA team ever in terms of Star power
4th place roster
Sure lose
This the season where we say the other countries closed the talent gap
malabo to mg champion hahaha mahihina pinadla
Yeh silver medal
Boys gone get smacked!!!
Dead team
whoa josh hart listed at 6'4 no and ant edwards shorter than him
I promise they getting cooked by Canada
"This is basically the Young Avengers, FIBA Cup aint mean shit. Next year in the Olympics THE REAL TEAM USA will dominate"
We had way better options for team USA  these dudes are good but not the best
"China will beat them, you know they got 8 roaster on court"
Looks soft to me!
Yea we about to get dogged
Happy to see AR15 on the team
Where is LeBron curry durant and the others
Ant do look like Jordan now lol
"If Cam Johnson is on Team USA, then that really puts in perspective how many good NBA players come internationally."
Everybody got a fresh cut and then theres ant man
this has got to be the most disappointing USA team
Secure 9th or 10th place
Whos number 14?
Bobby Portis MVP
God luck cause dam yall need it
USA getting swept
No big man they gonna get dominated in the paint
the US def gonna lose to Canada or Australia
good squad but. sorry!
"Why is are PAOLO on the USA TEAM 
PAOLO FROM ITALY"
"Well sad part is JA MORANT should be the face of these guys

..but dude let USA down....smh 
You put that tat on yo body.... You better show that MAMBA MENTALLY"
Look at edwards man. So inspirational
My nigga is that Bobby portis
"ball hog Bronson,,literally"
Cam is gonna be the next Melo.
Paolo Banchero is Italian dude
The worst squad we have sorry
This team no shib could get a ring with the right coach.
Weak
Let's go USA
Bobo portis

No Maxey is disgraceful
This team does not win gold

AAU team vibes
"man they goin to need more fire, like D A. fox and Malike munk, ja Marent, zayan Williams, Taylor hero, Robinson"
"Aw shit, looks like there will be no gold this time...again. I fux with Ingram tho n ant"
Times are changing. I see few tattoos there
Not a bad squad. But I'd be surprised if they get a medal.
New gen
Team E USA squad

1st round exit
Haliburton an Jaren Jackson are the X factors
Whose #14

Was that cam Johnson without sleeves?
We need one more big man tbh
Paolo look like somebody from the early 2000s
Trash team bro not like before
Ayo pildi nani
You telling me these the best players representing America?
"Damn my boy Brunson and Hart on the team? Love that for my Knicks, but for USAB? Team is looking real star less."
Canada is better this time. Real talk!
Wait walker Kessler look like buddy that mocks lebron a lot
No way josh hart and ant are the same height hart looks a few inches taller but I guess it could just be the view
Lol
Les goooooo
15 is legendary
I remember when the best players in the league played for team usa
Chemistry about 16%
Ant is on his Jordan shit. Dude finna take it to a next level this up coming season
Ayo. This is a tough squad.
I hope they dont disappoint. Gotta take this seriously
Where can we watch fiba?
