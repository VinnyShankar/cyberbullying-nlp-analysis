"I remember I was a kid and I had my hand through the window and my mom started to close the windows. Good thing I have quick reaction times, if anything the passengers should be the safer one since the driver could randomly shut it on them"
"when i was little I got my finger stuck in a closing window for 3 minutes.
Its painful, but no, it definitely doesnt break your finger"
Not putting my hand in the passenger side window
moral of the story: dont pee out of the passenger seat
Put ur hands yeah
I love how people forget we have bones and bones are as strong as granite
When I was a kid I was in my grandma's car at bucee's we were driving to my cousins house and before we were there I stuck my pinky in the window I tried to put the window down so I could move it and then it got stuck I was crying and then my grandma is really kind she asked am I bleeding I said no and she said good thing your finger didn't get cut off (it was a scary experience)

Now try your hand on the passenger side.
"When you said ""Lets try passengers side"" and did the hot dog I thought that was your finger"
"Well you see, I'm tired of seeing these tests online. It's clear that a human finger has quite the resistance to pressure. Meaning hotdogs, celery, and other things that are not as hard won't trigger the safety system. Just do a carrot and if it stops, JUST STRAIGHT UP PUT YOUR HANDS ON IT. You don't need that much testing bruh"
"Hand ? Oh got it, sad for your loss"
Posterior passengers: ...
"I remember the day when I was looking out the window as a kid and my dad accidently closed the window on my neck. Luckily, nothing happened. (we don't have a safety feature like america)"

Idk if this was me but whenever the windows were closing I would put my hands or fingers at the top even though I knew it would hurt and put my hand up there until it squeezes it and brutally bleeds and then I put the window down and put my hands out and wait for tomorrow for me to do it once more :)
"Ive put my finger in, its still a bit red"
i wanted him to test his hand/finger on the side of *p a s s e n g e r*

"Instructions unclear, my penis has now been severed by my car window"
You don't own the car you lose a finger

From experience it does not break your fingers
what about the hand test on the passenger side?
