Were you able to do it?
I SOLVED IT ..... think of it like there is something ur holding like a bicycle
Easy
I can't.
No. I'll have an attack.
Hard AF but possible.
Yes! And I can do different speeds with each hand.
"Arms are a piece of pie, try it with ur thumbs"
I had to beat do you said switch then it was over
My body physically won't allow me to do it
Can't yet
takes a few seconds then you'll make it. :)
Guys I have a doubt that does the phone effect if I take near to lpg gas
Still I'm trying
Yes
Yes.
Easy squeezy. Maybe im already dead inside.
Its a bike
I'm lucky I can think
Yes I can do that both ways
this webpage cannot be reached! i need to clear my cache and cookies!
"Give a hard one, I've done this as a hobby since 20 years ago"
"That Neil, always thinking...."
I can forcefully do it.. but takes lots of effort
"Easier if you happen to be Sinister minded, commonly known as a leftie,and while we make up less than ten percent of the population, we are the only folks in our right mind."
Not easily. But yes.
It's easy
Legends came into the comment section without doing the challenge
Wow that was actually hard
This is harder than patting your head and rubbing your belly.
No.
Easy peasy....now go away.
Yes I learned how 30 years ago
Damn ... i am being trying for so long ...  you need to use your full force of your mind to even do 1 rotation perfectly
He is absolute genius
That was something they had me do in OT after my TBI LoL I canNot do it!
Its not easy but i did it
"Once you get it it's quite easy to replicate, been able to do it for a few years now"
Muscle training and coordination.
My brain was like shock with this
I can. I think I remember teaching myself how to do it.
I can do it one way but didn't try to switch before. Will try and get back to you...
I can if i rotate one faster than the other but find it much more difficult to do and maintain if I try both at the same rate.  Not easy either way but for me differing speeds help.
And that's about what he is good for.
Damn
"It is hard but you can do it after some attempts,your brain needs to get used to it"
Do you think if i can do this my mentality would be stronger
Windows browser disconnected
"Yes, I did. Just stop thinking about rotations, focus on your hands meeting in two points (top and bottom), from different directions."
Yes but why
I tried doing that fast and I traveled to the future.
This is very easy I usually do this in free times
Yep I can do it! It's easy. I learned how to do that when I was a kid.
My brain just froze.
"Bcoz thats the basic life saving function for climbing  like breathing etc ,controlled by  brain."
No problem
This has been plying for an hour on my phone
I did this stuff when I was training in percussion... Second nature now....
Do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around.   .   .   .
I can. Am I genius?
"whaaatttt!!!, why is this so difficult man ?!"
Did it after trying slowly lost 1200 calories
"My 6th grade teacher taught us to do this with our index finger tips, we practiced all year and most of us got the hang of it by the last day, if you keep your eyes centered on where you want your finger to land it's much easier:)"
People in the bg be thinking that neil is doing tiktok dance
Easy peasy....
I can but it's not easy
Yes I can do it easily and also very fast.
With difficulty
Give him a skipping rope and double dutch yes I can but with my hands open does that make a difference. Then I made a fist and did the switching not yet
No thank you. Bye
i know my brain dont work like sir Tyson. Not givingba try
My brain stopped working thanks Neil...
"Yes, try it with your fingers interwoven and use your thumbs rotating in opposing directions!"
You're reaching for contact Neal deGrasse Tyson
That was easy
Only because I practiced as a child
"Never been able to do that,  my brother can."
"""That's great sir, but what would you like to order? You're in Wendy's?"
Yes I can.
I can't Neil.  You win.  I'll go get myself turned to Soylent.
Rubber baby buggy bumpers?
No darn it
a drummer test
Crap! Noo!!
Can do this since the age 12
It is impossible because corpus Collasum  which connects left and right halves of brain.
The problem is how you think about the rotation. It is easy if you point your arms away from you and rotate both of them in the same manner. All you have to do then is to point your arms inwards and they become counter rotating. The key is to still think about them as  rotating in the same way.
system reboot required..
How am I not able to do this?
Whos hands are those???
I can do it.
Took me a while but i got it
"I think the problem is that it is a motion that will end up making your arms collide, so you naturally would not like to do it. I can do it far from my body easily, but the closer I get the harder it becomes."
"If you just focus on the 2 points where they intersect in their respective rotations it's dead simple.

If you instead just try and rotate them as 2 separate entities with no unifying metrics then it feels impossible."
I did it but one arm was a lot faster
I accidentally punched myself in the lip
A bit slowly but it's possible
"I could do it with great ease.
*^visible confusion^*
Did I gain some sort of superpower or something. 
Pls tell me"
boxers do that every day
Yeah. No problem.
"I dont know why but my right arm instantly goes into ""left mode"" as soon as i start rotating my left hand"
Annnnnnnnd here's the latest dance trend 'The Astrophysics'
I did it it's a little hard but yeah th switch was pretty easy but once new how to move I did it
that's like the old one where you must pat you head with one hand while rubbing you belly with your other hand.
I think my brain just flash fried itself
I could do it no problem
I can do that
We used to do back in the esrly 70s
Is it about being ambidextrous
try making a square using one hand while drawing a circle using other and you'll run into a brain collapse
"I used to try this when I was about 10, now I'm 30 but I still can't do it properly"
"I can do it. It's easier to just think of it as moving both of your hands up and down at the same time, but one goes towards you first, the other one away from you."
Nope...you win again Neil!!
never
Yes I can. Give me another
"Wow it's hard , brain training"
"Reminds of "" pat your head and rub your belly"""
Nope lol
Easy I bet you I can do it and he can't
Easy. But maybe that's because I've been playing piano for 14 years
I think we just broke spacetime continuum
of course I can! who can't?
"Here's one: take one hand with fingers closed and take the hand fingers closed, placed both hands together and pray with me. Can you do that ? It's easier than you think . #prayermatters"
Get of my YT you fud
Next time I'm waiting in queue at immigration I'll practice
Will power took a few tries can't do a perfect spin have to have on hand sideways but rotating
I can. No problemos. :)
That's how people get pregnant
One arm is travelling back in time
It's almost impossible.
"Hey,that's not funny,lol.
I can but it takes an incredible amount of focus.its not easy."
My brain cells have achieved absolute zero activity.
"It took a couple minutes.... 
but I got it."
Easily
easy...
Yes......   I can do it
Is this Guy the only Black Scientist in the entire United States!??
Omg this is maddeningly difficult...
Eeeeeezzzzyyyyy
Dude ur a joke
Love a video without captions!
WTF man. It is like my brain is trying to stop me from doing that even though my brain is trying to do that.
I can .
It took me like 20 minutes but I finally mastered it lol
I can do it!
"Years ago , my son may have seen the same maneuver and challenged me with it"
"Um, nope. At least not yet"
We tried doing this over 50 years ago in grammer school. DeGrasse is supposed to be a brilliant mind. He should not be asking the question; Can you do this? He should be answering the question; Why is it that most people can't? He probably doesn't know the answer.
"Okay, so I'm not the only one who used to think about this..."
The only time he's not interrupting somebody
That's a good one lol I used to freak people out in school I used to be able to do all kinds of stuff like this tricks with my fingers lol lots of fun
I love you!! So interesting!
yes.... i can rub my chest and pat my head at the same time and switch hands
"Yes. I can. After 2 min of failing. I can. Not in a fast motion tho, and I'll mess up after getting it right for a few seconds from overthinking it."
It was easy. But I can dance and have rethem
No
I feel like a drummer could do that better than most
Yup
Yes I can. And I am ambidextrous. Perhaps that is why.
"yes, and I have another for you !! , not only I can do it , i do it with both my arms at the side of my head next to the ears and can switch their direction !! , Neil , can you do it like that ?? , the ones that we do it, what does it means ??"
What dark magic is this?????
Funny that he almost fails and laughs at himself
"My Grandpa asked me if I could do it when I was like, 5, I spent a long time figuring it out, now, over a decade later, I've mastered it."
Very easy
"I got one for you, admit Jesus, made the Universe!"
I learned how to do that with my arms and also my fingers
"Oh, I finally managed to do it after 45 minutes but I think I turned my liver inside out"
"Sir, next window please....."
"Yes I can, I can also Pat my head and rub my belly."
"Bro, why am I being recommend this?"
"I got one for you: Can you pray to God and ask him to forgive you of your sin through Jesu, and ask him to be your Lord and reveal himself to you? It's harder than it looks because of pride .  But totally possible."
"My neurons went on a strike, too much work for their pay grade"
"No problem good sir. But I have adult ADHD at 47. So I'm saprised what I can still do sometimes. 
And you my man are the coolest scientist on the planet in my opinion."
I can do it No problems
I almost went BSOD
"I got one for you ,what is a women."
I love this guy
That was harder then necessary.
Yes !!!
Not really that hard....never understood why this is an issue.
I can Neil
sure .... that's just the Cabbage Patch - bare knuckle ballet if you will. sunnnnn Uhhp dowwwwwn >
My system crashed
I did it but slowly
Not hard at all
Someone gonna dedicate their life to perfecting this now
"My grandpa made me this challenge when i was a kid...and i trained for a while but eventually i was able to do it.
A decade has passed and I'm still able to do it with ease"
I'm off
I failed so hard...
I flail my arms. I assume it looks like I just ate a scorpion.
Seems like Zombie exercise
Been doing it since childhood.....
Ok I did it now what
Ppl who have a specific brain surgery which separates the left brain from the right can do it
My brain is playing dinosaur game
I gave up
Yes sir
In dance it's easier
"That is very hard to do. Your body and mind naturally want both arms to move in the same direction, and you tend to go out of sync or start moving the same direction. Both legs, probably the same way. Why are we humans like this?"
F yeah I got to the point of slowly doing it and I mean slow
I can do. At once it seems hard and interesting but now it is more easy but still interesting...
Aaah very scientifical. Much impressive
"Never listen to criminals, believe me they should pay damage they did. End of story"
I can do one way but not the other
Yes I can...now tell me what it means guru?
No i can't
Broooo ainntt no way
Bro is simple. Really really simple. Stop
I can't do it!!!!
"Works better using your legs while sitting, to try at least..."
No!
"Yes, but it is harder than it sounds"
I can do that. I got one for you. Stand up. Rotate your right foot/ankle clockwise in a circle. Then simultaneously with you right hand draw a 6 in the air. Got ya!
I think I just sprained a lobe
A robot could
Tyson is high af right now
"Yeah, I could barely do it."
It is hard
I couldn't
Ez but if your a drummer it's les difficult
That's good!
How much practice do i need lol
Come to an Indian temple sir. You will see. We do this on a daily basis.
Almost like patting your head and rubbing your belly
"Yes, i can. Im a violinist. Jackie Chan can actually rotate one in a circle and the other in a square. He's inhuman"
Why would I want to do that?
No can do.
I used to do this when I was at school- people believed it was magic haha
Is this meant to be easy
He just became smart to me
"Took me a second, but got it down perfect."
"once achieved...it is called ""quantum love"" lol!"
Where are my choir conductors at?
"Weird, but it felt natural to me..."
Been doing this challenge since i was a kid
Man it's so hard
Can't do it but gonna keep trying until I can because you are showing it can be!! My brain needs a new exercise.
multitasking is a myth
I just glitched
yes I can
Is that like patting your head & rubbing your tummy at the same time?
Seems this may take some practice...at least by me.
"The ""brightest"" modern physicist."
Just imagine standing like him and doing the exact movements he shows you. I admit it took me a couple mintues to realize it
"Brain : nah bro i control u, not u"
Can you twiddle your thumbs opposite to the other?
"My neurons stop snapping, trying to rotate one arm first then the other"
not hard at all. and he's a rocket scientist?
"I can do it, but now I forgot where I live!!"
Bro really came from outerspace
"Can do it easily, but.. i don't see what thats supposed to tell me lol"
i can do it
Nope. Never. Nada. Not even with 2.5 million years of practice.
You know what Neil....can you do a random act that I instruct you to do?.... can ya? Can ya do that? Yeah shut yer face Cleveland
y so hard!?
No. Your the only one to know opposite direction. Your so smart. I learned this in elementary school.
"As a drummer playing over 25 years, I thought I'd have an easier time with this. Nope, it was possible but took some concentration. Well done, @StarTalk"
Connect failed attempting to Re-establish
YOU ARE A TRAITOR
Can you be more YOU now?
Kinda?
Does this mean I have a very high IQ?
"If you can do it, what does that mean?"
No i cant ahaha
Huh?
"Its all about the start. If you start them both off together it's fairly easy to do.. But having one already going for the other to join in is difficult, for me anyway,"
Yes. Yes I can. I have been able to do it since i was little because I heard it was impossible and wanted to be the exception.
He's right it is harder than it looks
Not possible
You a god
"Slowly, but doable."
these  are some challenges your mind accept passionately but fails in no time.
I did it but it was quite hard and it needs a tone of concentration.
Good hachich maybe
"Yes i can, this is how i do it :
Use my left arm to do the outward motion and use my right arm to do the inward motion
The key to do this without a lot of practice is to do the motion of each arms with different muscles.
In my case i used my left arm to do the outward motion mainly using my shoulder muscles while my right arms doing the inward motion normally
So yeah i basically cheated"
"I have another one for you. Have two computer mice, one for left hand and another one for your right hand and switch your hands every single day. Your IQ will skyrocket."
"I have seen that from a Wana be smart people, trying to impress hard working people"
"Yep, I can do it :)"
I can
Wait until you learn that you are the sum total of two inteligences made by the two halves of your brain.
Omg i have been bragging about this my whole life but you just added a switch to it. Must learn new skill now.
"No, my wrist is broken."
is this a martial art style? it might confuse the heck out of your opponent.
"""Sir please my water broke let me go to the hospital"""
That was an awesome trick thanks
Double it and pass it to the next person.
My physics teacher could do this and it was really impressively. Shoutout Mr. CM
Took ne 5min to do it exact but slowly
U got me thinkin'
I was eventually able to do it but it feels so weird
"There's 1 more question: Whats the name of the rat, who betrayed the real US president?"
"Sonny boy, go back to class, recess is over."
lmaoo it feels so wrong
"So I figured it out. You gotta do it slowly at first, and then you literally start dancing. Neil's doing some top tier psychology trolling here."
"I have been doing that since I was a child.  It was a challenge my father used to do to all of the 4 of us.  
We got special treats if we succeeded.
He also challenged us to do jumping rope  backward with the rope and forward with your legs/feet.

I was able to do the hands, but I could not due the jumping tope trick."
he's finally losing it!!!
why does this guy always come off like the biggest stoner on earth?
no my brain is not working like.
"Time longe ? To acheve thet 1 proceser 2 directions  360""  ande seouyitch repite apeset derection?"
Halfway do It brokenly lol
Still wonder why he is popular scientist .....
Does not compute
He cannot do it
Yup.... did it since school....
Take one arm and rotate it fast meanwhile the other arm rotate it slower towards the outside going faster and faster and there you go.
I see no problem here?
I thought I was about to get Rick rolled.
Those aren't your arms now are they
Just know that your arms will always both be at the same elevation.
"Yes, after engaging ctrl+alt+del"
Yes I can and it feels unreal for some reason
I just did that and almost punched myself in the face
Can you make a fist and shove it in your mouth then sit on a spike and rotate..would be better proof of gravity than mic drop...just a thought
I actually practiced this when i was a kid
"Neil, are you lonely bro?"
"Easy! The key is how you picture it in your head... Instead of picturing the arms rotating in different directions imagine them moving together towards the top, then towards the bottom."
i did it in less than 30 seconds
Rollem up rollem up.  Throw it in the pan ..
Yes I can but I may fail the first few attempts.
Neil looks like he's been skipping sleep for over a week.
F*CK
I literally cannot do it
Nope
Does not compute does not compute
He makes it look so easy
"Yes, I've been doing this mind trick for some time now."
Damn what a mind boggle. Took like a solid 2min to figure it out without weird pauses in between and the direction switch for my brain to not give me weird error codes.
"Yes, I can"
"Yes I did.
 .. I can teach it to you.. bring hands closer to your body, and move them in the opposite direction.. now move both hands away from your body as is, and again move against each other when farther.. and repeat..."
That's  hard!
Since I don't have any goals lately I'll keep practicing every day until i do it when I do it I'll come back to my video and update it if u don't see an update... Well I'm either dead or still trying
"yes. easy, since i was 6"
Who else thought it was a rickroll?
Error error brain system failure
"Pretend to hammerfist someone on top of the head with one hand. 

then uppercut them or another head with the other hand."
yes
"You mean like an Atom? 
Bro do I look like Adam to you!?"
I learned how to do that when I was a kid. My dad showed me this..
If you think about the fact that your hands have to pass each other at least twice before completing the circle it helps
Hard for 30 seconds
"My grandpa used to show me this and tell me if I could do it. He was a really great guy, this really brought back some good memories."
"Remember doing this back in p.e lesson aged 8
I think only 3 kids could do it properly an"
"Im surprised I can, especially after reading all the comments lol"
I can do it decently easy
That was the ezzzyest thing ever
"I dont usually have problems with these tests, why is this hard for me? I can rub my head and pat my stomach and reverse that but this is confusing me for some reason"
Too eays
"it took me a bit, but i did it (very hard)"
"I cannot do that...



Yet."
Well played mr tyson...
He acts smarter than he actually is. How tf is no one else seeing that? Elon Musk is much more intelligent
Why did this make my arms so sore?
I could do it since I was 12 and I'm legal now...
"When I try, one arm just start going in another direction"
Yeah I can do it
Ez
I used to challenge it with most of my friends in my childhood and only few could do that beside me.
Done! I Did it.
"So I did it, but I don't see why I am?"
Wait what
I can!
"Yes, I can. I can also tap the top of my head and rub my stomach in a circular motion. And switch hands."
Took me 3 hours to learn this s**t
Thanks...still trying at 3am
no I can't
My brain is struggling to understand this
What is happening?!!
I think we finally found a way to defeat Chuck Norris.
Please tell me how to do it I'm having a mini brain freeze
"Mike what have you done to advance science? I'm not talking about rewriting somebody else's protocol? I'm not talking about distributing somebody else's achievement. Do you have a theory?
Do you have a piece of glassware named after you? I know what women want. They want their purse to match their belt and their shoes."
Okay okay NOW he is just showing off
"Every video You do , look just older,...can You stop that?"
"Try to imagine them as balls and move them faster when they are to get lower ,Igot the hang of it pretty quick and I was able to do itkinda fast"
Soo hard to do lol
After 1 minute I did it for 5 seconds
the secret is just focus on one hand. you're welcome!!!!
I've got enough problems on my own neil. Dont...
Explain why I can't do it
Yes i can but I'm both handed
My brain keeps jamming but I'm getting the hang of it slowly
Its easy
"""Sir this is a wendys, what's your order"""
wtf
"Yes, focus with the hand you dont write with and docit with other hand"
Easy peasy.
Its hard i did half of it then they recenterd
"I was abe to do it, just don't look towards your hands then u will be able to do it"
Holy cow how
A firs This genuinley hurts my soul to realize this is challenging to most people or to offer it as a challenge BUT I've visualized & done this in Qi Gong & flow Arts for years and I remember it once being confusing to grasp & the concept fighting the motion initially
NPC'S : system override
Yeah easy
"Yeah, I can)"
am i special or its just a joke cuz did it in 1 go
Cuase nerves changes sides
Nah bro there's no way I lived for 15 years and never knew you couldn't do that well i can't do that
How can you do that?
Damnit
Tinininim... Windows shut down...
That was just impossible
That's crazyyy
IT WAS WIERD.
Noooooooooooi
took me a minute but i got it lol i love brain games like this
The peoples Indian temple i can do this all day
I can do it... very slowly.
NDT was like: *Do you wanna feel like a normie in the presence of a genius? Try this*
You can do that if you suffer from extreme OCD i found a pattern to do it
I did it just by copying how your hands looked. So it didn't take too much brain power for me. I don't know if thats cheating tho
"Sir, the is a Wendy's and I can't see what you're doing bcuz you're talking to a speaker in a drive through. Now please drive forward"
idk but i think i can
"""okay sir, can i get my candy back now?"""
I us to be able to do it. Not sure if I still can.
I always end up on the most pointless videos when watching YouTube shorts
What happened when the moon started rotating at the speed of 50km/hr ?
Bro pushed impossible to the next level
I ended up in the backrooms
"Very easy... So, now why is this a question?"
"the gatekeeper speaks,go back to sleep sheeps"
Super easy
Wow it actually is hard af
"I can only do it in either direction for a couple of seconds. It's not so much that my arms want to go in the same direction, but one arm usually starts flailing chaotically."
After a minute of practice i got it down
Had to go slow
My brain knows how to do it vut my arm is a spastic
I can pat my head and rub my tummy. ;)
Easy peezy lemon squeezy
Leave me alone
yes and it isn't that hard
Before the brain injury no but now yes I can
"Here's a better challenge. Follow the science, not the consensus. Can you do that?"
Ezz
"I did it on the first try and switched 3 times
I think I'm doing something wrong though"
I've been trying to do it for 15 minutes and I'm still unable to do it
**sets phone down**
My brain is not braining
"I wasted too much time trying to do this, and I can only kinda do it."
How long did it took him to get the hang of it
Hahaha best trick for drunk people
I can rotate index fingers in  concentric circles in opposite directions but can't reverse the reverse orbitital directions.
Nice try those are CGI arms
I malfunctioned the first and second time but got it the third time
If you're wondering the question was asked does he like the current president
You can train for it if you can't do it
Part 2?
Couldn't do it till I hit a dab
Bro made me sped with that
Its very easy I learned it since grade 5
Can't do it.
MotionControl.exe stopped working
Definitely yes
I use to be able to but I think my age has affected this
Watching this tickles my brain
Wtf how did I do it?
I can do it very easily when on elementary school
How am i dying from laughing at this sh- IT'S NOT FUNNY BUT IT'S SO WEIRD
"Took a second but i can, and also switch it back and forth"
Yeah? Am I genius yet?
"I couldn't at first, but after a few rotations, I could do it slowly. With good practice, one could do that at a normal speed"
I looked like I was having a seizure
Brain. Exe is not responding
Haha only one revolution
My brain isnt braining
I did it
"I can but they aren't in circles, more like vertical ovals"
Check engine light came on
System Failure in my brain
"Takes a bit, but when you try enough you can do it really wasily"
This is my trick.
Is this deep fake?
The npc test
"For years I can do this. i still impress my friends, i learned this when my teacher showed me, little bit of train i think you can do it."
Yes I can
Oh...this trick i tried when i was 10 years old but none succeeded can anyone tell me why..i figured it out early..?
And just like that i wasted my 1 hour trying
Incredible hardddddd couldn't do it fr
My brainn...AaaAaAhhHh
"Try closing your eyes, it gets easier. Managed to do it very slowly after a little while and not for long."
""" Brain stopped working"""
Glitch in the matrix
Wanna be your friend so bad PS just bought your book today!!!!
Nope.
I was able to do it however every time I switch direction I fumble slightly. Overall mission accomplished
I just killed my last brain cell
"I also have a challange for you.
Read the quran"
Took me a little while to figure out how to do it with ease but ended up actually doing it. You just do it outwards and then get closer to do it and close your eyes to do it and then you can do it perfectly. That's my process
I can do it but i cant switch Hands does it count?
"I'm genuinely having a ""wtf is this witchcraft"" moment"
HOW
Hes AI generated
No I cant.
"Took a few tries, but I got it"
Yeah that's old
Easy.
I dont have the switch
This is literally impossible for me
E Z
ERRORS
Nerd flex lol
I swear bro it must have locked like I had a seizure
I tried that a long time ago i did it over and over until i did it
One arm and one foot is even harder (at least for me)
Try with fingers and still a fail
I would probably be able to do it if I could stop hitting my face with my fist when trying out this sorcery...
This was charles mansons final aquired skill that failed to get him laid before he started eating people.
Easy....peezyyy....buddy
Yes. But I had to go in z mode.
This was my parlor trick in middle school to mess up the jocks.
i can do it really slow
My great grandma used to tell us stories and do that same thing but with her thumbs at the same time. Like how
Ooommmggg not working system failure
Bro interrupted himself
i did
damn thats not harder than it looks. Its WAY harder than it looks!
remember always trying this as a kid and my brain would just fail
I did it i swear
I swear to god I figured this out in grade 3 lmao. Me and friends used to do it all the time.
Doable but takes practice. Took me 10 minutes to find the rhythm
"Dr. Neil, I suppose Drummers & Piano players can step it up on this one ..."
2 hours here. Still can't do it
I was able to do it but it took serious concentration and many many attempts
Took ma a bit but yes actually!
Got me feeling dumber than I already am
Yes but it's difficult
I can do it but the one going outward is alot slower than the one coming inward
This is the grown equivalent to rubbing ur tummy and patting your head lmao
"""He's probably out cheating on me"" 
me:"
Failed
i did it but my mind played  tricks on me first i had to really think about doing it and i did
That was harder than it looks
well i can do since i'm in my 4th grade
yes i can i love asking people to give it a try!
"fine Neil, because this is interesting,  I forgive the interruptions for now"
Damn took me a few tries but yes I can
