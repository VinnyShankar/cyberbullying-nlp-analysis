Wild pigs will tear up ypur corn crop. Be prepared to move them or lose your crop.
That the cutest baby pigs wver

folks I know keep a rifle in the cab .
Where is a pig with the babies now would be good to know
Too cute
Run the porky pie and bacons down dead
"That's a domesticated sow, but she and her piglets will turn feral if left to roam.  At least she gave birth to the piglets in the open and not a cramped fucking gestation crate."
"Poor momma, please say the machine was stopped and help was given to this mamma and her babies"
"Mi auguro che sia stata salvata, insieme ai suoi cuccioli!"
BACON
Os animais tem fome.tomara q essa pessoa tenha sentimento
Good save Sir!!!
BBQ in the wild
Sucks. She and all those piglets need to be killed but I wouldn't want to face that decision.
What 5 year olds thought when trying to figure out where the animals were in the farm. When the typical person thinks this pig is a viral HOG edition
Isn't this the channel that shoots hogs with helicopters?? In that case her plus her babies are doomed!
contrived.
Go fast
These are a trillion dollar a year problem.. pulled pork sammich
Drop it in low and go!! They are dangerous and destructive. Gotta go
Poor Mama is still nursing.
"Shes not done spitting them out either Id be grabbing them, thats a farm pig that got out, enjoy the little babies because in 6 months they are 180 pounds!!!"
Yum...bacon bits !!!
"Big-Fat Sow and her little piglets.....suey, suey!......"
Reap what you SOW
"Mae e mae,agora e so o condutor da maquina ter compaixao"
"Detente Sr  maquina ,rescate a los chanchitos."
"Oh, I'm glad they saw her before it was too late. Cute as can be."
Just stop she trying to move her babies and protect them animals got more love for their kids than some humans  they first intention is protect
Me supongo que pusiste a los lechonsitos en un lugar seguro
No encuentro la continuidad del video
"There's nothing to harvest in this field, for the safety they might used harvester to approach close to new born piglets and mother to replace them."
Ainda bem que que o cara parou
"It's disgusting to see how the video ends there. The person just wanted to record the mom's fear?
Where is the show of compassion with the person recording actually helping em to safety so he can finish his work.
But nah, he just records how scared they are and leaves us wondering what tf he did to em.
Ion trust people enough man I hope them pigs ok"
I hope that farmer left her tf alone man. I really do :(
Kill it wild pig who cares they destroying crops n fields
So schaun die heutigen Wildschweine aus-In china!

Time to put the the tractor in sausage making mode.....
"OMG so effin cute!   That's what we are thinking.    The momma pig is thinking,  omg omg what's that monster coming for my babies!  What do I do what do I do"
Burn Them All (Mad King's Voice)
We are being abducted

Ein Hausschwein  im Maisfeld?
"Did they tell you about their ability to cut visceral tissues, while out of their bodies......that's right, to Human Being's flesh on the GROUND, who do not come out of their body! It a REAL Tonya Harding storyline!"
Pense na bronca que ele arrumou.
"Ach herjee ... ich hoffe, die kamen lebend davon"
amount of intelligence from reading animals is amazing
How cool. I got more pigs than I had before.
"hati2 ada hewan  ma  ansk2 ny  lg ngsuh   kasian, brenti dulu   bang,"
Thing had puppies Right in the middle of harvest Season
No go bro it's over rover shes looking like what should I do I got my little ones here I'm sorry please leave us be for give me
No creo  que siga
"Clever sow, to jump up to protect her piglets without squashing any of them."
"Hopefully this farmer moved her babies behind his machine where he had already harvested the crop....
...so she would follow him with her babies.  Then he could continue his harvesting without harming the piglets and Mommy !!!!!!!!"
Is this a vegan farm?
Thank you for stopping!
The sound and the fog makes this erie af for me
Sacanagem vc coloco ela ai  tira agora sem traumas
Go around
STOP !!!
I love that one little spotty piglet.
"Grab the moms and her pigs call a far,er put them in the farmer truck and there we go the moms and piglets be safe and happy"
Amaizing
Thats where all your crops been goin... into that fat khant ripe for the Pot
Good pig
A un corral

Ham sandwiches

Die wurden alle Suppe.
"Well it's bout time you showed up, I'm lost and been squealing for hours."
It looks like the women moved the babies to her barn and mommy followed thank God that could have ended badly
I hope someone was called to move her and her babies to somewhere safe
"Catch her, easy enough to do. In the barn she goes to raise her kin. We did it a lot where I was raised, and they were wild ass Russian cross breeds. No B.S, it was normal."
The Mama looks like a domesticated pig.
YOU MONSTERS! YOUTUBE YOU ARE DISGUSTING TO PUT THIS ON MY FEED!
Para
Help a lady and her babes out!
"This animal has more humane interesting, and some of the women that are mothers today!!! And you know damn well this farmer probably called it a day or one through the other side of the 600 acres and started over there!!!"
now that is free range pork
Nice stand of corn .
Dude why did you stop? The big one would have gotten out of the way and the rest of them would have just not been a problem 3 years from now
Come here my future pork chops!!!
wild pork
Yhhjjjhhu
These babies were like 3 hours old for the looks of walking and legs look with out stretch
bro the moving farm vehicle is such a beast lol
Mom's are the best.
Sows will kill her babies if seriously threatened. Back off!
"I pray you helped the mother and babies , so glad you stopped"
That lies interesting for animals we are growing up to eat for food...never understand
Record their reactions as they are turned into baby bacon.
When the channel name finally makes sense.
que lindo
help?
Looks like Trump with his Cult members.
Now THAT is a viral hog
"She not done yet, still giving birth"
"I would have killed them there because when a herd starts rooting, everything is destroyed.
That means the plants you eat will not be in the store, so you would have nothing to eat."
That's when u just put it in reverse n go park it ur day is done n let mom n babies alone
"Sure, hope he went around."
I wonder what happened
Did you save them
Little bacon pops
bacon for the next few years
Stop please
hope they save the sow and piglets
She has eaten your profit
Que coisa mais linda
Pigs got out this guy isn't going to hurt them it happens all the time on farms sometimes animals get out and it's usually a community effort to get them put back in their homes this isn't a slaughterhouse.
Bum Fat Family........Fat Family...kkkk
"Those are probably his own. 
Feral Hogs are much darker in color."
WOW IF she is a farrow sow having piglets out in the open like that you DON'T get close to her they can/will take you down.
Helps to mow faster.
Jesus people are mushed up in the brains.

The field looks like an infinite abyss
take them out of the field move it somewhere far away
"I told Mom & Dad to stop complaining about me leaving the pig pen gate open.....

I'm going to find the mama pig & piglets TODAY if the last thing I do!!"
Not sure I understand why they don't just immediately stop the machine. Why creep up on it slowly?
"Do not disturb the animals with heavy vehicles, they are very sensitive seeing the sound and appearances of  heavy vehicles and it will create a panic not fear, pls understand.......if unfortunately happens okay, but scene seems  repeatedly creating the panic to mother pig..... This panic is equivalent if we know earlier that some one is throwing a bomb in our home terrous.....same feeling........"
Maior a maquina pode parar sim
Mmmmmm bacon
What you gonna do now
John pork
That pig is a better mother than Alexee Trevizo
Run those things over
Looks like we got us a sow here instead of a boar.
"Lol, oww mom you just stepped on me... I already have trouble walking n now this, thanks mom."

Hoffen wir dass er drum herum gefahren is
"When directly confronted with actual pictures, we people care - when going out shopping, we people don't care where it comes from. Only thing i really hope is that in less than 10 years we will have artificial meat that tastes 99% like real meat and costs not more than real meat and is accessable all around the globe in all areas. it will be only then, that people can stop eating normal meat because there are no remaining reasons to do so."
Piglet meat is delicious.
That is cute as hell. What a ferocious mama.
Fabian ge da weg
Should I make bacon out of them
A nicer video would be showing the machken stop and the animals relocated
Shoot it!!!!
Turn around and go backwards the way you came.
"Poor lil pig family,Hell the farmer outta just fkn skip ahh small piece of crop and let em be."

Hopefully you can exterminate them before they cause too much more damage
Please dont hurt them...rehome them
Pig & piglets shit in your harvest!
Woohooo bacon
She just had those very recently
Little piglets can barely walk
That's Dick Darstardlys combine!
"my assumption, she might still giving birth, normally female pig give quite a lot of baby (4/5-17/18, depends on age and diet) , and sometime it take more  then 1 full day.  But, irregular birth can be dead of less chances of servible. 

And, you can only see 7 of them quite recent and one is very fresh born."
Dude you could of had baby back ribs.
bro speeeeeeed to kill pig
Don't you dare
Woww
"Pork belly, anybody sorry somebody had to do it"
Yummy bacon with corn
"Ugh you should've kept right on going. Those things are everywhere. I like pork and animals. Yet, it is insane how fast that litter of piglets can multiply"
Blue states don't pay more taxes. Blue states are taxed more.
Don't make sense with tiny pigs
She was so scared!

"Wtf stop, you can see she is in so much distress,but yet you gotta get the video ."
Free bacon...
"""Fight me demon!"""
"Makin' more bacon, now I'm hungry."
They don't move then you move stupid human
That corn looks ABSOLUTELY terrible
How come a white pig in wild farm? Believe if hogs was there
Looks like mother pig just gave birth.
Next year you wouldn't have crops

",Salvalos dos mio"
The pig must be killed because it is an ugly animal
I hope you respect the space of the big mother pork and  her babies
Pier thing at least call someone to come get them and get them a good home
Comon
Allahuakbar tolonglah jangan diapa apakan binatang yang tidak berdosa itu..semuga Allah SWT membalas jasa anda Amin ya Rabbal Alamin
She just had her piglets to
My mind: more pig=more food
"Going to eat all your crops, got to take them out"
Ayo
Not a wild hog considering her coloring.
Pick them up and have a barbigue in the next month
If he would shut off the combine she will walk on her own way out and little pigs will follow mama
"Wir bringen die Sau zum decken, weil die Ferkel schmecken"
B
Why even keep that machine running that long
Just plow thru them a little sausage flavoring is always good
Bacon
I didn't know we planted bacon in this field.
"Yes she brotected the babies it's a mother thing. I don't think she was wild, I grew up in the woods. Every year when it got cold we butchered a few 5 one day the most. Salt wraps on the quarter and the rest of meat. My uncles hogs you could walk right up to them in the woods. This hog looks just like his tamed ones. The piglets to. All white most feral hogs have color in there markings. You judge it!!!!"
Piglets as cute a s a puppy
Que bueno que no los mataron
Que lindo porquinhos .
That's sad:[
una chancha recien parida..pobrecita los ha traido al mizal ....buen lugar
Everyone remain calm the pigs were killed peacefully
"A Lion is watching this on TV like "" Everyone be quiet turn that up...where is this happening?"""

Nice
I hope save all the family.... other way Fuck humans.....
One of them looks dead
Aww.
Bebessss
Eyos no

"That big look delicious
Pls make pork eating video"
Do not disturb her...

Go ahead
Qu'est ce qu'elle fait la ???
free bacon
Go around!
Did you save her and her babies?!  Did you just kill them all?!
trample them
Omg shes terrified.  Heartbreaking
Hopefully they shot all of them. 7 piglets ready to breed @ 6 months old able to have three litters a year with 7 to 13 per litter so average of 9 per that's 63 piglets every three months & 187 per year... yeah shoot all of them.
Grab the shotgun
Let's hope he put them in safe place
Please for the love of Allah keep driving
Resien los tubo
U should turn off the machine n shift the family to some other safe place
"A Wildsau reist aus , a dumme Sau bleibt stehen"
Where the daddy at wtf?
Minced meat.
Yummy bacon
Well if you run over a little one she will just eat it! Kinda looks like someone's domestic hog got loose.
"I'm shocked how many people fail to realize that this mother can feel fear and concern for her children.  You can tell from her body language and facial expressions that she is very desperate and nervous.  Pigs feel compassion and empathy, it's been proven.  And many other animals possess these social skills as well.  Always reducing them to their instincts is stupid (but then it becomes easier to eat them)."
Ido hope he turned the machine off
They almost maid it lol still ended up as food.
So what you gone do Mr farmer with the big ass tractor? You gone go around?
Why scared them like that. Assholes
Aaaayyyy
Dijo la chancha ya valimos tocino

Had to shut the camera off to get the 22 out.  Can't have hogs wrecking the crops
Mmmm...bacon
wie ging das aus?
Mmmm que rica fritada
She eats all the corns of field and she is scared of punishment
"In Texas, he could technically keep going and make some bacon bits. No season on hogs and you can literally pay to fly around in helicopters with automatic weapons and exterminate as many as you can with no limits. Hogs are extremely destructive for farmers."
Spero che li avete salvati
She looks like a domestic pig that found a place to have her piglets.
Why did you stop the machine go ahead
Fat moma on the loose!
I hope this driver stops to shoot mama & babies out of the way !!
Ruined the farm. I would hunt those things down for food if I had a chance
