He is the best commenttator all around the world
Africa All stars team wins the game
Aaaahhhhhhh France gets Penalties in every WC final they play
I was speechless. France celebrated winning the WC like Man City winning the UCL. Shame on them.
Africa 2.0 playing really well
"Messi, Messi, Messi. This is old and no one should care. Messi one Qatar 2022 World Cup against France. The 2018 World Cup was one step below 2022 World Cup.
Argentina v France for the final (France won the previous final), and Croatia grabbed third place (2nd place here). Argentina was eliminated by France in the round of 16 in 2018, and World Champions in 2022.
If you say that France has been in more finals, you are ignoring Copa America finals because that is Argentina."
THE FIRST TEENAGE WORLD CUP FINAL GOAL SINCE PELEEEEEEEEEE HIMSELF
What was France doing to there mangener
2023 ?
Absolutely deserved L for croatia
I love Mbappe with PSG
Game Rating 7.5/10
Most Boring final ever.

who's the commentator
LA FRANCE A REMPORTE LA COUPE DU MONDE !
"Seeing this rn in 2023, I felt like this was France vs the World

The same can be also considered for the 2022 final except being France and Portugal vs the World"
"One of the most beautiful World Cups in the history of soccer , counting everything ( logos , presentations , stadiums ...)"
Congrats france for your first world cup
Africa not France
I was so cheering for Croatia that day but unfortunately this France team was so strong and they took care of my primary favorite in Round of 16 and then my 2nd favorite in this final the moment i saw the Mandzukic own goal i knew France was gonna take the cup home
They win 4-2.then they lose 4-2 against argentina
Why is noone talking about loris's goal keeping
The bestworldcupfinalever!!
Africa Congrulations World Champion Russia 2018
Sudac peder

i'm french i like croatian but RAMENEZ LA COUPE A LA MAISON ALLEZ LES BLEUES ALLEZ
"Kylian Mbappe Is Now A 1 Time World Cup Winner.Go Ahead,Turtle"
biggest robbery in football history
Mpabbe and Haaland will be an even greater era then Ronaldo and Messi but they were great to watch to when they played in Spain.
prime griezmann - 2goals 1 assist in world cup final
Francee... Talents and Team spirit.. with Great Coach De Champ......... Unitedddd Team..... One LOVE
iam here
croatia robbed
Why was number 7 after he did the penalty shot why did he do the take the L Fortnite dance
1:55 does any one notice Kante? he look so cute
The world wanted Croatia to win but the FIFA wanted France to win
From today i hate perisic
"Allons France !!!
Nous sommes les champions!!!!"
"Peter Drury always making a match look like a movie, absolute legend"
"The one and only reason I don't like mbappe, he made me cry back in 2018"
Mbappe was an animal since the start
"4-2 finals 2018 France wins
4-2 finals penalties 2022 Argentina wins"
Croatia can beat anyone but france was waaaayy beyond their level. Similar to how Morocco got France to end their dream and Argentina was the one to stop a repeated France vs. Croatia 2022 final
espetionly Luka Modric
france might best croatia BUT CROATIA IS STILL BETTER!:D
I want croatia to win:(
Best moment
MBAPEE- OH MY WOOOORD
"2 minutes
Yep that's pretty much sums it up"
Greatest robbery ive ever seen...
"1:10 
bro went POGBA POGBAAA"
1:02 speak for its self
"""The first world cup final goal sicne pele himself"" That's how much of a great pele was and mbappe is going to be the best in the world too!"
La peor final de la historia
"Greizmann:
*runs, stops, emotes*"
Look at prime france I was rooting for Argentina but still felt bad for France
So in 2018 world cup Russia Belgium gets third but in world cup 2022 Qatar they get grouped that makes no logical sense to me.
"Many people will come to this video and they did not think that there were controversies but if they watch the entire game then they will see that two goals scored by France were controversial, the first from a non-existent free kick the second from a penalty that the Croatian where the arm was in a natural position and where unfortunately it was a penalty but what most caught the attention of that penalty was that Griezmann (who was caught on camera) tells or wants to tell the Croatian goalkeeper where he should shoot so he can score the second goal, Although later I realized that the Croatian goalkeeper in that final was injured and the question is who lets an injured goalkeeper play in a world final? I ask myself that question to this day because at least 3 of those 4 goals that France scored could at least have been avoided. (For me this final was either agreed or stolen from Croatia)."
pogba him
I think 2018 world cup is best
"1:10 pogba..




1:20 mbappe

Commmetry"
Mbappe is a future GOAT
00:01
"... if france one 4-2 but argentina scored 4 and france 2, 4-2????"
The fact that the second ever teenager to score in a world cup final after Pele and after exactly 60 years is amazing!
Does anyone else not remember this at all? Like this did this even happen
"For the ones saying bout the population of croatia , quality > quantity, thank you."
"2022 france is second and croatia third, they stick together always LoL"
"Pogpa,kante,griezmann,giroud and mbappe is the best"
"1:21 mbappe has now scored a hattrick in the 2022 world cup, what a player he has real potential."
M BAPPE  is better of with the cup he does every thing for the team and he just gets the golden boot he is the reason why they won  and in the 2022 world cup. They  diden't win but he got them to the end . he does every thing for the team but gets a boot so you should let him get the cup next time France wins
robbery
"2022: ARGENTINA DEFEATS THEM BOTH
croatia in semi final
france in final"
France
I hate this English commentary guy
GOALLLLLLLLLLL
In the future I'm a France player
Ref was paid off.
It was the best  world  cup final
Before there was Salt Bae..
Ni el partido ni la ceremonia final fueron tan emocionantes como en 2022. Felicitaciones en el 2018 Francia. Pero la mejor final del mundo de todos los tiempos fue la Qatar 2022.
The champion france
I want France win
"Crotia and France Both Beat Argentina 2018 ! 
And Argentina beat both of the to win The World Cup 2022
Thats is Something unbelievable !"
Remember Mbappe was 19 at this time...
Netherlands & Croatia are unluckiest teams ! Made it to multiple finals but ended as runners up!
Only a loser celebrates a penalty goal like that
"mbappe
2018:the first teenage goal in final after the legend pele
2022:the first world cup final  hattrick after geoff hurst"
1:10
Did you Know that France won 2018 world cup against Croatia by 4-2 and lost in 2022 against Argentina by 4-2 In penalty shootout
"Argentina lost to both 2018 WC finalists in 2018
Argentina beat both 2018 WC finalists in 2022
A lot of things change in 4 years, wow"
The only regret I have about this French win is that Pogba became a world cup winner.
"This is the worst final I've ever seen 
No offence"
Noooooooooooooo!
Croatia vs Africa
"""He has screamed that in."" What an incredible commentary"
2022 final Is the best !!! All drama tension sadness victory found in one game !!!!
Nothing excites than the final between argentina vs france 2022 final !!!
Messi is the GOAT.
"French! You got this back in 2022!!! You were tought a lesson in 2006 and in 2008 from Italy, too!!! A loser gang, that's what the french team is."
Who is in 2023
Rigged ..
This Time Argentina had the last laugh
"Mbappe: we r world champions
Messi: no u r no longer ,we r the reigning Champs...the crown is with the GOAT"
I'm so glad france lost
France was missing pogba is this 22 world cup.
Even for 2018 1:01 is cringe af
Why were the English commentators in 2018 much more exciting than the boring 2022 ones?
This is by far the best commentator
How the heck did Croatia make it to final??
"2014 Messi cried, 2022 Messi is laughing all the way to Argentina. Now i can finally say Messi is the Greatest of all time."
Andddd yeahhhh i found something strange out that France won against Croatia with 4-2  World Cup Russia but when I go back see final result Argentina Vs France World Cup Qatar it's ended up 4-2 again.coincidence???
Legends watching on 2022
who here after final wc 2022!!
2022 trophy celebration looked more better and royal because of the dark lights
France will win in 2026 mbappe will get another one
Mbappe vs Argentina was a great world cup game
var work in 2018 but not in 2022
Bad Final when you see the Final in 2022
The commentator is super cool I wish he was in 2022 World Cup
How times fllies instead of france griezmann now mbappe takes france every penalty
"My guy was doing the ""L"" dance  at the people."
The scoreboard of Croatia/France and France/Argentina is same but it's only in the penalty kicks
"I hated this match 
The most boring final in the history of this tournament"
"Am I the only one who ""remembers"" that Croatia won in that final?"
"Croatia came 3rd in 1998 France.

 They then came 2nd in 2018 Russia.

They now come 3rd in 2022 Qatar.

Incredible team they have, very proud of their effort and work in these games. I hope they win themselves a gold one day (maybe in 2026?)"
"2018: worst WC final of all time
2022: best WC final of all time"
"football is the best sport these world cups truly delivered, Vamos Argentina"
"2018 france croatia 
2022 Argentina france"
Who's here after Argentina won the world cup 2022?
Not going to lie this was a boring final and it was expected.
It is clear that Europe and countries such as France and England are countries of exploitation. Almost all of the French team consists of Africans.These countries should bot be included in the world cup
"Where was Pogba, Benzema, Kante, Nkunku and more?"
can't believe mbappe only 19 at that time
I came to Watch Mbappe after 2022 WC Final
Here after Argentina beat France 4-2 on penalties in the final
"Anybody Watching After 2022 Final 
Please Like here"
I seriously need to know why this official fifa channel didn't upload a single fifa wc 2022 highlights.
yea 2022 was more exciting
If this team was facing Argetina well we all know the result will be different!
Let's just realise Argentina beat both World Cup 2018 finalists
2022 Final was much better than 2018 Final
4-2 argentina vs france
Who's here after the 2022 world cup
Here to see Mbappe happy face after losing 2022 worldcup against Argentina.
Mbappe has to wait...
"Finally, Here after Argentina the legendary Lionel Messi won ,2022 fifa wc final."
Croatia are very respectable given they have a population half that of my city
"I am so happy the african team from France lost.
Diversity is a weakness."
"Considering that Brazil won against Italy in 1994 (the year Brazil lost Ayrton Senna), lost to France in 1998 (France was the host) and won against Germany in 2002 (only to get beaten up by Germany 7-1 in 2014), will France make a comeback in 2026?"
to think that 1 year before this mbappe would basically be a highschooler is insane.
I'm here after Argentina Wins FIFA WORLD CUP
Whos here after they lost
I came here to relive this moment after France lost today.
Who here after World Cup 2022?
Who are there after 2022 final?
France was just so close but Messi was there and congratulations mbappe Ik he was gonna get a hat trick and win golden boot and walk past the wc trophy like Messi did in 2014
"France won World Cup in 2018 with 4-2 in regular time.
France lose World Cup in 2022 with 4-2 on penalties."
And Now France Lose versus Arentina
Can't believe mbappe won a FIFA World Cup at only 19!
"I wanted Messi to win his World Cup @ Quatar 2022 , even though as a nation, I supported France so the outcome was fine for me. Really glad it was a competitive match in the end rather than being a walkover for Argentina."
after seeing sad face on mbappe i rewatched this after france loss to argentina in world cup 2022.
They already won. Let Argentina win now lol.
"0:00 this didn't happen in Qatar, did it?"
Who's watching this after Argentina lifted the worldcup?
anyone here after Argentina Vs France?
Nothing will beat the final of 2022. Amazing
Here after Mbappe Heroics in final
Fun fact Argentina won
Whos here after argentina won the world cup 2022
France almost had it again! Croatia got really far too! Congrats to both!
Missed
The next World Cup final has started!
FRANCE MADE IT AGAIN TONIGHT. TWO STRAIGHT WORLD CUP FINAL WINNERS. CONGRATULATIONS!
Will Messi complete football and become the ultimate GOAT or will the French create history with consecutive WORLD CUP. just under five hours to find it out and i'am starting to get very nervous
Here is the planet's ultimate game the final of the 21st football world cup
And Today we will stay on the top!
Legend watching in 2022 december
France gave away 2 goal so easily
Africancia cogetelo a argentina para que messi tenga pesadillas hasta que se retire del futbol
africance chapion 2022
1:22 I've never in a longtime seen a player like mbappe the dude is a just incredible in his own ways
"Matt Ryan at it again guess he was like ""28-3 in the sb wasn't enough.....i can top that from 1x time to 2x time record holder"""
Croacia pechos frios
TOMORROW THE STORY REPEATS
"France is winning it again,"
"Don't worry Croatians, Messi will get them for you"
"Is it me or does nobody see the ""refereeing errors"" that favored France, for example the ""foul"" of the free kick to Griezmann that ended in a goal?

Something more debatable is the Penalty that they gave to France with the hand of Perisic."
incredible World Cup Final
Super match
"Wow, cool football!"
1:50
"Now France are in the finals again, this time, against Argentina"
"that game won't happen against Argentina, believe me"
Time  for France to win it again in 2022
Did Benzema play this world Cup?
"I'm 19 and Mbappe scored a goal, and won the World Cup at a younger age than I am.  Nuts."
"This world cup final is not interesting at all, Croatia made it look very easy for france"
I seriously do not understand why it takes FIFA two days to upload highlights of the previous game in the 2022 world cup!
goalllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
Slapped
"4 yrs later, France is on the final again & should defeat argentina in the finals"
New champions Argentina
France win 2022
1:25 chills since Pele!!
"No foul free kick given to Griezmann and OG after that,then handball witch these days is not handball and wasn't then but given like FIFA always gives to those in need !! VAR is brought to this game so they can manipulate easier..."
Looks like France is going to be the third to take a back to back win!
France + africa vs croatia
THEIFA HELPING MESSI STEAL TROPHIES
France will get it again 2022
"Croatia is the most underated team in football history, its insane that they have a population of 4.5 million and can produce one of the best football teams on earth, i got a feeling they winning again in 4 yrs"
"No way that it could beat France, Better team win the cup on that day
."
"Who is going to present the trophy at the start of the 2022 World Cup Final? Lahm did here, since he was the 2014 winning captain. If France, as expected, do go through to the final, Lloris would be playing that game and cannot do this trophy presentation.
Edit : It turned out to be Iker Casillas in 2022, who also presented the trophy in 2014 final."
Il vont refaire la meme chose cet annee il son chian
La france a acheter ce match
"just came back, after Croatia's loss against argentina"
Let's repeat this again!! please I know the Quatari have a bias  for  argentine  white....  but France has to prove that they  are within that nucleus...   they must  prevail!!    Beat the  moroccans  and then beat  Argentina!!
is the 2022 French squad better than this one? Wondering if they can win Argentina
I hope Mbappe destroys Argentina. Qatar 22 is in favor for midget Messi to win. Every game ref is paid for midget Messi to score BS penalties.
Who is here again in 2022?
Congrats to this AFRIKAN-FRENCH football team fow win this world cup 2022 in Qatar
Am seeing crotia again to the finals
This time 2022 world cup final will be played by Croatia vs. France and next win see Croatia 1-0 France
Croatia I die with you
Most scandalous match Ive watched in such a big match.
"Final world cup 2022 Will replay, between France vs Kroasia , and winner France"
Apa jadinya jika ini akan terulang di final 2022 ?
if france v crotia on 2022... it's will be epic game !!
Morocco
"Will happen again, with Croatia taking it home 2022"
"History is repeating itself this year,France all the way up."
Africa 2.0 = france
"Man f France , anyone but them"
No penalty.
This felt like a friendly game lol.
"Worst world cup final i have ever seen, this match is not equal game, too easy for france, because croatia reached final with luck and always via extra time or penalty shoot out, so their stamina, endurance is down.
And croatia level is not for final so this match No goosebump, no drama, no intention, no tactical, just so many goals."
final terkonyol
Usess match ever one sided match
"Probably the worst final ever.
3 out of 4 goals Croatia conceded were Og, handball, gk mistake."
France will win the World Cup again-
You all ready for rematch?
"Crazy how it can happen again, but now they have a keeper!"
Morocco 2022
"for the uninitiated, the 1st french goal came from a free kick won by a blatant griezmann dive. moreover, it would have been disallowed under new rules because pogba who challenged mandzukic for the header was offside. the second one came from the penalty that according to the new rules (and old too, but vaguely) is not a punishable handball."
Mbappe life's = pele life's remake live action
and we might get the same match up again.
Croatia deserved the World Cup especially since they beat us (England)
"Can't believe 4 years ago this occured. The greatest month of my life. 4 years later, it comes to an end. In a week, this will repeat itself. The planets ultimate game."
POV:Argentina win the world cup by 1-0
Argentina vs France final.
2018 final moroco verses crotia
Fifa 2022 Will Again......
I watched this and I think there is no fans for France!!! I don't know why?! May be someone says their blacks they are not French they are blacks... What a racist people  thinking like that!!! In the comment box full of Croatia fans!
Croatia never had a chance in this match and this new French squad is even stronger and dangerous.
"Its December 11, 2022 and I believe Croatia vs France could happen again next week. My hope is Croatia will be the winner this time if happen."
Rematch in 2022?
Why people saying no african team won a wc? Watch this video
0:28 pure football
Fun fact : You came here because you know it's going to be the same in 2022
Croatia will meet France again in the 2022 world cup final
Imagine Croatia vs France again
"4 years later, both teams are one Match away from repeating the 2018 World Cup final."
is this for England to won this year tonight we going send France home for sure
"im still here, after 4 years. i have to say not deserved, refree on their side, he made sure france won."

Fun fact: France vs Croatia can still happen again
FU hrvatska.
I was rooting for Croatia during this game. It is sad that France won
Allez les blues
Hoping to see this again
The most useless and boring world cup final ever
Football World Cup
FIFA World Cup
mbappppppppppppeeeeee
M' Bappe is Dangerous like Captain Levi!
2018 world Cup is my favourite.
Incredible how it started to pour down rain when they won too.
"I must have skipped that 2018 world cup, and here we are 2022, time flies."
For france and possibly now the world.
"VAR ruined the game, pinalty and offside"
"such a lame final, Croatia was against weak teams and always won in penalties or extra time. It's just lame, I hope Brasil take them out"
Viva la France!
Now I look back at this Cro have a better keeper now
"France pay for win
Croatia win in our hearts"
Boring world cup final
this dude really did a fortnite dance in a FIFA world cup final
Africa world champion
I feel like penalty should be banned in final
Is it just me or was the Croatia goalkeeper not about it
Jesus Saves!
"Very strange that Croatia recived 4 goals on final when they were almost perfect on previous matches"" to play for a draw""
It looks  like an agreement between ..in which  France will have an easy win ..and France Football will give Ballon d or to capiten of Croatia LM

The ""Final"" was enough to celebrate for Croatia"
France for 2022
is this France or Africa?
"That was a BS ""handball"" call that I and every Croatian will remember as turning the tide in France's favor."
"""The first teenage world cup final goal since Pele himself"" is the greatest achievement any footballer can ever achieve"
France is in Africa?
"The dumbest finall all of the time,,"
Is this is the french team? I thought this was South Africa
bro did take the L
"Poor goalkeeping
Though"
It's was the best moment
I am sure croatia and france will be in final again
How half the french team were from the colonies.
I do feel bad for croatia look at their goal keeper lol
What a match
Who's here after Tunesia choked France
"Was never rooting for either team but watching the ending brought a tear to my eye, the beautiful game will never die"
Worst world cup final ever
Oui
W
0:58
Croatia will win 2022 wc
Seeing Griezmans celebration is jarring lol
"Own goals
Penalty (handsball) 
GK Blunders
Pitch invader
Fortnite dance
the funniest final"
"X: How many times did you watch this
Me: Yes"
i still remember like it was yesterday especially pogbas goal incredible it was one of the best and memorable days in my life
4 2 is a crazy score for the biggest sporting event each 4 years
Time flies
Peak Griezmann
The most boring final
"The stupidest, silliest most boring world cup final"
Who's the commentator ?
Where's pogba now?
Viva la France
The job is done
LOBILLOS MUSICAL DE DURANGO.
Who is girl at 00:01
Croatia also plays well on this match
Nostalgia
What a win for france
Croatia were R O B B E D
1:02 FORTNITE LOL
France with only 2 French player kekw
What a blooper of a World Cup this was. Worst one I done ever seen.
Croatia should have won :(
France? More like Africa
Griezman itu gabia main bola sumpah percaya ma gua
BELGUIM WAS BETTER
2018 WC>2022 WC
Worst wc final ever. No one knows where Croatia is and how they reached the final. Was the least viewed final ever i didn't watch it.
africa world champion
Mbappe so underrated at this time
Jesus is King
Mbappe> Ronaldo and Messi
Mbappe> Ronaldo and mezsi
Am I the only one commenting we when are in the 2022 World Cup
I hope to see similar match during this World Cup
Man i miss the hype for the finals
to this day i still think that if they wore the lucky black-purple uniforms we would've won
bro where are the fifa world cup 2022 highlights? fifa did well with them but I cant find them here anymore for some reason
"This was actually a great World Cup looking back at it, the vibes were amazing."
I was 12 years old. The world cup creates so many memories
What is the name of this speaker?
Well deserved champions
Last time pogba did anything
France is champion
ready for 2022!
Africa vs Croatia XDDDDD
So nice to see lahm
Who's here before FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022?
"4 Years, 4 Months and 5 Days Later
FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022"
"*Today a new World Cup begins after more than four years of waiting, so you have to enjoy it as if it were the last*
*Let's enjoy the great goals from the great matches of the great players and this last World Cup with 32 teams*"
pov its 2022 and World Cup 2022 just started in Qatar
much respect for CROATIA
Fixed final
Many didn't enjoy this game. 6 goals is too many for a Fifa World cup final
Hiii
"This was the worst final out of the past 3. Everyone knew France would win although I wanted it to be close game it wasn't. Hopefully this world cup has a close, unpredictable final."
"Been to Croatia a couple of times. Humble, traditional and honest people. 

And they barely have a right to be where they've been as a footballing nation but that goes to show you just how hard working they are. It's not a coincidence either, the Bobans, Sukers and Srnas of the old days are proof of that."
I'm here before World Cup starts tomorrow
"This world cup final was insane, lets hope this one will be insane too"
One day for the new World Cup!!!!
Legendary commentary
Time flies so fast....it was world cup 18 final ....and tomorrow is fifa world cup 2022 qatar
Croatia done very well getting to final but i always felt some team wood hammer them England had 4 clear cut chances against them in semi Russia had at least 3 you don't win a world cup with a weak defense
goal
1:01 bro accidentaly pressed the emote button
Semoga terulang kembali timnas Prancis juara lagi tahun ini
The match felt like Croatia were handicapped from minute 60 onwards. Their energy levels disappeared. A shame because had they not been so exhausted we might've seen one of the all time toughest finals in the world cup
Croatian team 100% Croatians.....France 95% African.
Not as memorable as 2010. But congratulations france
"This year, I think france maybe eliminated from the group stage."
"for the people who feel like roasting lloris for the mistake. The defender should have just cleared it but instead he passed it to a keeper who was being pressured.
I am a fellow GK"
The most rigged match in history of fifa
Respect
Griezmann deserves aids for the fortnite dance
Some forgotten final
Running midfield by kante and pogba was really scary. But how about the line up of midfield this 2022 WC?  Without including pogba and kante can make a different version of france?
Croatian goalkeeper was bought out
Griezmann will pay for that dive and that celebration when he scored pen
Balkan pride. Bravo Hrvatska!
We are back
"a smile on pogba, makes me smile"
Worst match of world cup ever
I remember going crazy when Croatia equalised it
Looking at this before 2022 wc and tbf he all knew france would win this game but for Croatia to score two goals it exceptional
kinda unlucky for Croatia; a penalty followed by two unstoppable bangers.
Pure joy!!!!
Great dive by greizmann
Mostly African players from French team
It's not Team France it's Team Africa.
Pogbaa pogbaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
"Bunch of frauds - France. Every goal was a fraud goal
Most pathetic world champions

Only Griezmann and Giroud were deserving world champions"

The worst world cup ever completely ruined by var and bad teams
I love croatia. I supported untill the final.
Hope France stays at group's phase this time. Only penaltis.

"The most boring final in history, the penalty ruined the game"
Pogbas goal was like a shot from training ground
Imagine if Croatia actually had a competent defense
Mandzukic underrated af
messi
Time files so fast and we're counting for the 2022 world cup

Africa
France is the best
Griezmann showing no class once again.

1:08 - 1:15
Great for Croatia..

"Missing Karim Benzema the most,If he was there france team was fullfilled.Eventually he is going to Qatar with that trophy and also maybe with the balon dor."
For a world cup final this seems very underwhelming
What? Croatia played against France in the World Cup Final 2018? I thought they played against Africa.
The first teenager to score in world cup final since pele this was the rise of legend mbappe
"Sunday July 15th 2018

10 Denmark"

So excited with this commentary
France becomes first ever African team to win the world cup
"It's just absolutely incredible to see a country that exists for only 30 years with a population of 4 mil citizens,  playing in the world cup final. Although they didn't win the game, it's still stunning."
The Worst World Cup Final Ever
i have never stop watching these highlights
"Man this is a cool coincidence, the 1st world cup final was 4-2"
Kongo won it fair and square
cant believe a  whole continent (africa) won a world cup
France weakened after 2021 Euro
Now that Croatian guy who scored will play with the spurs gk
Now who is after Croatia take the Revenge of the world cup 2018 final
"Sad that Croatia didn't win, it would have been incredible if one of the games superpowers didn't win it, business as usual for the big team though."
Who's here after Croatia beat France?
"Le van a pesar mucho las palabras a Mmbape, Francia eliminado de fase de grupos en Qatar 2022"
"I think croatia could won because they played much better than france, if you watched the game, france scored because of luck and then croatia fell apart"

Amazing Croatia
Imagine if England defeated Croatia in the Semi-final
The only team in history to win the world cup with only 10 players playing during the whole championship.
Dam I forgot Croatia made it to the finals

"I really wanted Croatia to win, but better team won. I always want a new country to win world cup"
Are we ready for 2022?
This still feels like yesterday
"France, greatest country in the world."
Time flies like a fly
Most pathetic world cup final
Next for France?
foreign legion vs croatia
The difference between the gap from 2014-2018 and 2018-2022 feels massive. The 2014 world cup felt ages ago and the 2018 felt like last year.
Still watching this
I watch this video because i really miss the best version of griezmann
quel malheur j'adore la Croatie
This is the worst of all  world cup finals played  in 21st century
This is like friendly match goals

Gate ball use the brain
I can remember watching  this with my dad
Next follow the planet cup event
Boring final
mon matuidi mon ami t un vrai guerrier
Pogba in EDF is one of the best midfielders of the world.
"Croatia  is very  dangerous  futbol national  team against  everyone. 
Amazing"
Sve neki Afrikanci u Francuza
It was so funny when greizmann scored that penalty and did Take the L
"I was in Munich Germany that time.. in India you don't see so much craze but back there though Germany was out of the world Cup but still there was football madness all over.. once France won all over the road people were celebrating.. bear, bottle of whiskey and dancing, honking, it was delight to see that craze..i too got some celebration with locals, French...still relish those photos.."
Here before the 2022 world cup
"Man, 2018 was something that you would like to go back to."
"look at my video where Griezmann dived, thanks ref!!"
"Pogba , Pogbaaaaaaaaaa"

This was 2018.....and this is 2022.... time is so fast
I remember at the end of the final I was telling we're gonna have to wait another 4 years and now here we are in 2022 to witness the Qatar word cup!
"I felt kinda bad when Croatia lost, but its ok."
ion understand why mbappe pointing at mandzukic just enjoy and celebrate the goal dude
I have celebrated finding a candy in my pocket with more passion than the french scoring at the world cup final...
Congrats Africa!
Still watching this in 2022
One side game.
That is not a pantay to France one of the player has a hand ball
Hopefully we get as entertaining a world cup final match as this. In the forthcoming 2022 world cup later this year.
Almost Four years later....
The game that made kylian mbappe..
Am french and I want return in 2018. Miss.
Francuska nema 2 prava Francuza koji igraju za nju sve crnci.
"World cup 2022 is here.
Time flies"
1:00 look at this bast*rd.... why do you show the looser hand Symbol...
"Today is the first time after the finale I had the guts to look at the game again. That day I was so heartbroken (I am Croatian, obviously) that even before the end of the game, I got out of the bar where I was watching the game with my friends. I went for an hour-long walk to chill myself, like a walking Forrest Gump. I never even wanted to look again at the game.. until today.

But we celebrated the whole night in Zagreb. It was so crazy, like we won the World cup! We were proud of the team and Croatia. I even ended up in a German tv sports show filming in the city. An amazing day I will never forget"
"How Lloris even gets in goal for them is baffling never mind skipper

USELESS"
Worst Final
China + India population:2.7biliion Croatia:4milion ..?
Mbappe scares me
Nice to see Phillip lahm
"French scored the first goal of FIFA World Cup 2018 Final at the 18th minute of the game, what a sign of the future"
France super lucky they must have stepped foot on a fox both first goals were mistake of oppenents even with Argentina
All those who threw for France here are winning the World Cup
"As a German, I'm glad I didn't have to witness someone of my team doing this 1:02 in the finals."
"Time goes by so fast, and I hope Portugal and Argentina will be in the final this WC, Cr7 and M10 will together end their legendary career.

But it seems impossible :("
This was kinda dead
"As a Croatian I'm still gutted about the result I thought when perisic scored we had a chance I really hope that croatia at least win a medal this world cup but I doubt that we are far worse than 2018 no rakitic, mandzukic, corluka, subasic all those who carried us to the final they are gone and we haven't made replacements for them I doubt that we'll get past the quarters ALI AJMO VATRENIIII"
Croacia llego ahi porque le toco con ewuipos faciles. La final fue francia belgica ese partido si era de machos
5/4/2022 watch again
This game wasn't seem like final
Cant believe it has been 4 years
africa won the cup
"Looking back, both great stories. But, Croatia had played 3 overtimes and penalty shootouts before finals. Dead tired. 1 day less of rest and judge was wrong in two occasions which have proven to be goals for France at the end. Nevertheless - congrats to France but in my mind and in mind of lots of other people around the world - CROATIA'S TEAM WON THE HEARTS that World Cup. Amazing"
Who says time machine not invented yet.. youtube is the closest thing to it.
"France Croatia 1998
France Croatia 2018"
France did not deserve to win
Dos tercios del equipo de descendencia negra (con todo respeto) xd
"Still angry about that penalty decision, never a penalty in a million years"
Wow
Africa wins the World cup not french
2022
