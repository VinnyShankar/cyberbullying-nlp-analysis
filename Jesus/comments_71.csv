"During these times I suffered from cancer and depression at the almost beginning of Covid, and since I have gotten better."
Dogs really do smile.

Watching this in 2023 squad?
Average day in norway
i dont understand how people think frogs are disgusting. they are so funny and cute
2:26 johnny english reference

"""this is your yearly dose of internet"" confused me for a second."
2:35 only in russia
"I really feel bad for that frog, i wonder what really happened to it. Anyway 2019 was actually the best year of my life, kinda missing some good old days of 2019"
This is your YeArLy dose of internet.

"It is not russian, it is ukranian copter"
4:46 proof aliens exist
2:55 WAIT HOLD ON?!
2:31 average day in russia.
No way I thought the caterpillar was breathing through its nervous system
$100 says those russoterrorist helicopter pilots are toast now (dead). I would also be willing to bet another $100 that when that that fly over the highway was filmed those pilots were drunk as fuck. Glory to Ukraine!!!!
Thank you for brightening the internet. Your amazing
Why is no one paying attention the speed on the bottom left. 2:29
Y'all i cant see any elephant

"Your video compilation is so refreshing and entertaining.  Comical, informative and relaxing.  It's only because I don't possess more time that I haven't been looking at the selection on your channel.  Your channel is the best entertainment on YouTube and the web.  I finally decided to watch today because if I didn't today, I never would because I wouldn't ever find any extra time in my life, anyway (although I had watched one video at the time of subscribing almost three years ago).  I'm so happy I decided to view your content today.  It's magnificent."

I don't like the animal ones. A lot of them involve stupid humans and animals in distress. Would you consider not using animal clips or at least being more exclusive in your selections. Thank you
4:06 For the thumbnail

Aliens 4:49
squishy 4:14
0:23 GYAT
"2:27 That`s why you should never specify a country not to annoy anyone. This is a video from Ukraine, seeing that the helicopter literally has the Ukrainian roundel. It`s also very logical as the video is most likely from the eastern regions, where people speak Russian, and they had a war at the time of the recording, which explains the presence of a military helicopter"
4:13 good god. Clean those nails
I wonder what type of butterfly the catterpiller will be.

1:24 anyone else feel breeze?
Day frog a savage
5:00 bruh way to ruin the illusion
Lucky mouse.
2:30  Flying low over a road is done to 'sneak' under radar.  Road traffic creates 'interference' which helps conceal the aircrafts presence.  I've seen RAF aircraft do it (though not so low) in the North of England.
God loves u have a great day!!
who new that covid was a thing

"The ""Russian helicopter flying in Russia"" is actually a Ukrainian helicopter flying in Ukraine. Its flying so low probably to avoid air defenses or something, depending on where this was recorded that is. Because the war in donbass has been raging strong since 2014, so if they it was filmed in the donbass, from what i recall the war picked up in intensity in 2019"
"ok, that was NOT four years ago..."
2:28 it's Ukraine airforce (blue dot in yellow circle). Hello from Ukraine
"why is no one talking about the fact that the helicopter that flew over the car one, The car was going 200kmh?"
