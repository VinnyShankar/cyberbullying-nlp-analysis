"I was a little kid and my mom and I were driving to Virginia to see a family friend. 

This was pre smart phone age. Back when you printed directions from MapQuest. 

My mom stopped to ask for directions. And I remember I was sitting in the back seat with my DVD player and the window down. 

I had one of these float up to me and fly away. I was scared shitless. I distinctly remember the red furry body and the stinger. Now I know what I saw."
The pain man! Oh god! How dose he do this
I like-13:42
I like1:14
That's nuts man. One time I was in Florida. Long story short. I passed out in a fire ants nest. Didn't know it at the moment but I was on fire from my wasre down. I then had to take a greyhound bus trip back to Virginia. 14 hours of being very miserable. All I had to help with the pain was the beer i took with me on the trip. I still have scares. Never want to do that again.
My dad picked one up in Indiana and ended up in the ER

"Grass is a type of plant with narrow leaves growing from the base. Their appearance as a common plant was in the mid-Cretaceous period. There are 12,000 species no A common kind of grass is used to cover the ground in places such as lawns and parks. Grass is usually the color green. That is because they are wind-pollinated rather than insect-pollinated, so they do not have to attract insects. Green is the best colour for photosynthesis.

Grasslands such as savannah and prairie where grasses are dominant cover 40.5% of the land area of the Earth, except Greenland and Antarctica.[4]

Grasses are monocotyledon herbaceous plants. They include the ""grass"" of the family Poaceae, which are called grass by ordinary people. This family is also called the Gramineae, and includes some of the sedges (Cyperaceae) and the rushes (Juncaceae).[5] These three families are not very closely related, though all of them belong to clades in the order Poales. They are similar adaptations to a similar life-style.

With around 780 genera and around 12,000 species,[3] the Poaceae is the fifth-largest plant family, after the Asteraceae, Orchidaceae, Fabaceae and Rubiaceae.[6]

The true grasses include cereals, bamboo and the grasses of lawns (turf) and grassland. Uses for graminoids include food (as grain, sprouted grain, shoots or rhizomes), drink (beer, whisky), pasture for livestock, thatching thatch, paper, fuel, clothing, insulation, construction, sports turf, basket weaving and many others.

Many grasses are short, but some grasses can grow tall, such as bamboo. Plants from the grass family can grow in many places and make grasslands, including areas which are very arid or cold. There are several other plants that look similar to grass and are referred to as such, but are not members of the grass family. These plants include rushes, reeds, papyrus and water chestnut. Seagrass is a monocot in the order Alismatales.

Grasses are an important food for many animals, such as deer, buffalo, cattle, mice, grasshoppers, caterpillars and many other grazers. Unlike other plants, grasses grow from the bottom, so when animals eat grass they usually do not destroy the part that grows.[7] This is a part of why the plants are successful. Without grass, soil may wash away into rivers (erosion)."
I understand why you do this to show not to mess with that insect or animal

"I felt so bad for you but mostly for the cow killer because its being forced to sting someone and being forced to stay into a container. Please, let me now if this at all disturbs the  animal/insect."

We get these in the Central Valley of California as well. They are incredible insects. Peoples minds are blown when explain they are wingless wasps. Such beautiful colors too. We get them red and orange.
Ngl I have been stung by a cow killer
I dont even know how he has even abit of braveness to do this
"When I was like 8, I saw one of these outside, and I smashed it. I hadlue how much danger I was in"
These things were migrating through my backyard at my house on Lake Lanier in Georgia. I was playing outside and saw this giant ant with pretty velvet fur on it. It was in the shade so it looked more purple than orange but yeah I'm glad I got up and ran when I saw it. Nearly walked over my bare leg and that would have prob been a hospital visit.
You are so brave
i cant remember how long its been since i've watched this
When this guy dies his body should be inside a muzem
This man is the original tough guy

Stop getting stunned for YouTube
How is he not dead yet I know that's mean but dang bro's immune to death
How this person survives
The most insane thing to me is that he has the dexterity and mental capacity to recapture the insect after being stung
Dang if I was if I got stung by that I would die RAAAAAA!
This man is immortal
He somehow laughed while getting the sting?
"You should want a tiger shark, and a great white bite you"

"My Dad told me when I was a boy
You don't know what being stung is , until you've been stung by a Cow Ant"
We feel so bad for you
Coyote literally laughs in the face of death
"If this insect can kill a cow, why he dont die?"
I bet I could eat you and you could still survive.
Don't do this to yourself! You could die. Stay safe
He is like my science book
He is my role model of being brave
