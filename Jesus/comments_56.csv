"Why glitter? Why not glue,acid,nails,etc.. a REAL deterrent."
"A Simple Grenade would be a Deterent Forever..
Why Not."
W
Nothing sweeter than some well engineered revenge.
this is better than justice served to a thief !!!
"Glitter, herpes of the craft world. They will find glitter in everything forever."
We have a huge epidemic of porch pirates in Grants Pass Oregon. We need some of these traps in our area.
I'd use nails instead of glitter. Thieves must be punished.
Mark rober on his way to make a glitter nuke:
Lol lol lol lol lol lol
Watching all of these glitter bombs again lol
Love it !  Now there is hope.
Any idea how to find YouTube scammers? Please
I am beyond impressed
I love this video
It should say nuke dropping in location in 5 seconds
If it wasn't for those awful couple you wouldn't be making these machines of revenge
"Irony : an engineer named Mark Rober dedicates so much attention to catch actual ""robbers""

Great video, great chanel, great engineer and great person !!"
A normal dude would have just bought a gun. Mark is over here making some Home Alone contraption just to mess with people. Amazing
About 5 minutes ago
Is this trap sold on Amazon yet. I want one
do it again only use claymores
I bet they do it again!!!
I have now watched this 10 times
Karma Karma KARMA
bro why are you so chill hey literally stole your package
love it
I'm trying to understand how the package itself was filmed in one guy's car (the one who was talking about his gf) Did a phone fall out?
This is where his Villain Arc Started.
The last person was like the most chill about it
Can you make me one!
"I wish someone would get one of those big grass spiders who is carrying her babies, and put her in a box, and write fragile on it, and get it filmed somehow.  I would, but I live in the sticks, so no porch pirates."
It sprayed 6 times during the demonstration
You should design cool devices for the cops.
You know someone actually tries on his YouTube channel when they actually change the captions to see what they said.
4:11
America is the worst place to be in
5:29 it like a white box
"""What do I do about porch pirates now that the authorities won't do anything? Oh wait. I'm Mark Rober"""
"Please notice these perpetrators are NOT homeless, visibly poverty stricken, or minorities."
88mill views lol gahhhhhjjh
"He is the literal definition of ""I'll do it myself""."
I want one!!!
""
"using cellphones is overengeering, why dont you just use ESP32+CAMERA+MODEM"
What car is that???? Mark?
Wow! Wanted to know was the weight of the glitter light bug small or micro mini
no ufens
bro i hate gliter
Here we see the origin of the porch thief hero
Brilliant.
Love it.  Wish I had one for my front porch.
If you are new here this isnt a prank video
"3:34 that's brilliant
As an uncle with 3 nieces, I can tell you glitter is the devil's particles. It's almost impossible to get rid of. This is a perfect use for it"
Y u so smart
Rewatching all of these in 2023
I LOVE it!!!!!!!!!!!! Maybe you can find a cheaper way to construct these for retail sale. Flood the criminal market with glitter.
You could sell those. Everyone knows someone that we think should have one
I thought Glitter bombs were illegal?
this is what all started
Dont take a package meant for someone else .... frickin losers
I literally threw up laughing so hard omg dude lmfao
Dude! You are My Hero! I just had my 3rd truck cover stolen and it had three locking (one thin metal with small combination lock) thingies attached. I am sooooo feeling violated! Wish I could do something like this.
Love you Mark
love how some of the second guys found it funny
6:37 they enjoyed the glitter
MR look so cute and young
I love this
1:23 Dollar Tree employees.
"Ah yes, the herpes of arts and crafts. Glitter. I once wore glitter to a dance 2 years ago and i still find it around my house."
Yeah
"Glitter takes an eternity to get rid of. And even if you think you've cleaned it all, years later you'll still find more."
I would have just track down the first package thief with all those resources got his identity and open a civil case against them.
You make it sound so easy to understand this stuff I like it...... What gets me is the other dude was laughing at him....
You can tell you love what you do
crazy its been 4 years already
love these videos.
Honestly the police being useless assholes is no surprise.
Thank you for everything you do sir.
"Dude, load it with ink.  Lots of ink"
"As tempted as I would be to put an I.E.D in the package, this is also funny"
It would be so amazing if we could purchase these to put on our own porches during the holiday season
"Imagine those ""lovely couple"" were honest, this whole glitterbomb series wouldn't exist."
I'm here after 5.0
Woaoaaaah this is sooo coool
It was well worth all your time and engineering to make me laugh!  Well done!
"""Who you had in here?"""
cus of these 2 he caught the big scamming companies :)
4:10 might be my favorite part of the whole video.
Not effective enough. Put something that does damage to theif's property
There still getting 4 phones out of this
The police is a bad joke
That porch pirates created their worst enemy
Macaulay Song-Culkin a walking Legend.
"I love this, I wish I had the resources to do this from me and my channel too!"
Hi Mark...Thanks for this awesome video and all the things you are doing to get back at thieves!!  You're one smart cookie!!
4 years ago today this amazing video was released
You should use pepper spray trap
Came here after 5.0
That theif had a girlfriend?
"Glitters cool, I use a lot.  Thanks for the video."
This is the definition of a butterfly effect lmao
"You live in a bad, very crimey area"
Replace the swell glitter with fentanyl..
Sometimes I doub the U.S. is a first world country.
Brilliant !!! I like the  ink suggestion below .
'The greatest invention ever born'
"It would be funny if the just started dismantling it, and you Rick roll us"
He also bought 4 phones
"I never thought he would risk multiple phones just to catch these guys, amazing"
Love your videos Mr. Rober
"Boring, next time dog crap"
Cool! Now use mustard gas.
I thought home alone 1 was at 656 lincon bulivar. Turns out I was wrong.
"I watched Home Alone last night. ""Are ya gonna giv up or ar ya thirsty for more?"""
4:21 last night I was watching this video and it reminds me of the supernova
"I don't understand that. Here in Germany it's illegal to put a parcel on the porch, because it will be stolen!! The delivery guy has to give it to you or maybe your neighbour..."
Ahhh yes home alone the first one I like the scene when buzz choked on the pizza
"Blue dye, damage control"
But some glitter doesn't really do much.
You need to sell these.  There is a guaranteed market for them.
Should make one that flings out razor blades
This should be a TV show.
Thanks
looking at the number of package thieves that have guitars hanging on the wall is pretty interesting.  guess it still pays better than being a musician :D
This is at a level that's hard to comprehend. You Sir are a genius!
would have been better with explosives
Are you still doing them.
The second you realised you just robbed the greatest engineer ever.
how can i make something like this but with something different inside
Should of used oil based gloss paint all over their car or homes hahah ..instead of glitter
Brilliant!
How much for one of these?
Hype for 5.0
You need to sell these things!!!
Cops make me laugh crime is not worth looking into.
You know mark you have a product to produce and sell.
Next time but some sort of liquid to make everything wet/sticky/slimly.
Imagine they brought the package to a funeral and opened it there
Imagine what he can do to his sons science project
I've seen enough to know how to reconstruct it.
Please please please give us ideas for catalytic converter theft!
5:00 did you just dox yourself?
"4:22 4 yellow, 0 purple
(taiji reference)"
"""Keep the change, ya filthy animal"" Got me. LOLAF"
The dude in the beginning really got caught with 16k cuz of the 4 phones lmao
My dad told me to watch this and I loved it!!!!
Lol
"I think there was a violation




































meme"
"Mark, I believe your video as real.  Your imagination & engineering abilities are stellar.  I have an idea that I'd just like to throw out to you.  San Francisco's automobile break-ins & theft (lots of catalytic converters)  is ridiculous.  I have a very nice motorcycle.  Many of my neighbors' too & others have scooters.  I had an idea about 2 years ago for an invention to deter auto criminal behavior.  Make a device that would deliver an electrical shock when it is engaged ;  like a car alarm but an electrical shock instead of sound which people (even thieves) are desensitized to. What are your thoughts, if any?"
I'm a little late
Ridiculous scripted
"the home alone reference is the detail that make this video perfect XD, when people ask me what celebrity id like to meet, i never hesitate to say Mark Rober"
"So much work, but in the end must have been satisfying."
Imagine being the first guy to get glitterbombed all these years later.
"Here's my saying when it comes to porch pirates and thugs.

Violate me? I annihilate you."
This I love!
We haven't been to the moon or have  unman vehicles on Mars.
This is again a song regarding the most hated birthday party of your life. Be ready as this Drug lord wished you a very Happy Birthday!
Someone literally stole from you and the cops say it's not worth there time. Every cop in that city needs to lose there job and give them to someone who would actually do the job we the people pay for them to do.
"Hear me out. I'm not a criminal,  but you should put sleeping gas. Actually nevermind don't do that..."
We had public punishment in the USA.  Time to bring it back.
You are a genius. I am sure your viewers want this product too.
Great video!  It makes one want to do this to every single thief.  The only problem is using glitter.  While it very effective glitter is plastic.  Do you really want to make pollution worse just because some lazy loser crook is alive?  Has to be a better way!
"Mark, I have a problem living in an apartment,  I keep getting door knocking and management break ins.
 What I need is a top corner door camera with audio for both inside n out, 2 cameras.
 What can I do, please help."
I really wanna make one of these so bad.
You should use supergleu that wastes their interior
They still get 4 phones in the end lol
I guess you just marked the robbers
You need to use dye. Make sure it ruins there interior
LOL
did the phones get stolen at any point?
6:00 the tie fighter sound got me dying
This is like a glitter version of your elephant/devil toothpaste
i love that its glitters and not critters!
"What if Mark Rober, never got robbed?"
All YouTube roads lead to Glitter Bombs
Wait did he leak his adress?
"This all started from just package theves
Then he started saving people from scamers
Now he is shuting down scamer work places"
*A T O M I C  B O M B*
"Coming back here after re-watching your catching scammers video
The fact it started from here and now is going to a whole another thing"
"""Keep tha change ya filthy animal!"""
The To and From is almost as brilliant as the glitterbomb trap! X'D
wow
so funny!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
My question is how did he get three different stealers to take HIS package
"Wow that's LG G5 phone , nice choice for camera !!!!"
anyone else here watching this in 2022 and knowing how much mark will dedicate to this project?
He should sell this!
Can he make more and sell them?
"5:55 Yes!
6:30 YEEESSSS!!"
I HATE glitter so I'm weird I guess
How much would it cost to buy some? We have a ton of porch pirates.
And this is how first glitter war started
revenge is sweet
Well done Mark Roder
Lesson of the day don't touch mark's  packages
You helped build the Mars Rover?!
funny
t
a
m
I love these troll videos
that was so cool you should teach us how to make those in a video of yours
5:45 he looks like MatPat
you should become a cop and arest some people
My mom hates glitter even though she has glitter in the basement
4:23 looks like a new galaxy being formed
"This is incredible, you are my hero"
why not just call the owner and they will grab it or why not just make a shute for the pakages like why ;-;
You doxxed yourself and the thief at 5:00
Boi you Albert Einstein
That is very clever that is one way to teach thieves a lesson lol
I love home alone movie!
Mark is a super hero
"Today was the first time I watched the last part of the video for whatever reason, and that far spray part almost gave me a heart attack. Legendary Stuff, sir."
How nice of him to show us his car
hey brother I live in the bay area and working they stole my backpack and my phone I know where they live but the police can't do anything. Would you like to help me teach them a lesson?
"why are they living, scammers?"
Amazon needs to get into the dye pack business.
"Mr. Rober, please enter into a business selling these things.  I'm sure plenty of people in certain places (San Francisco comes to mind) would like to buy these things.
Edit: Grammar corrections were in order."
The glitter parts a joke try using bronze powder it's impossible to clean off anything
2022? Anyone
Wireless charging mat disguised as a front door mat bill help keep the charge
"Who knew this would of evolved into Mark working with the police, and others friends, sending spies to India to combat scammers"
"Absolute Best!!!  the only thing better is rest of the videos in this series.  You have to check out 2.0, 3.0, and my favorite the scammer call center!"
Only see color
Please use something recyclable or food grade glitter as a substitute for actual glitter because actual Glitter is not eco friendly and really bad for water bodies.
big
Imagine getting attacked with a glitter package by a NASA engineer
4:48 Ayo whatttt
You should use skunk spray so they can't get rid of the smell
And this folks is why I have trust issues
"i just realized that this got referenced on henry danger season5 episode 21
which got aired almost a year later after this on September 21, 2019."
"Hey genious, love you, How much you sell it please, would buy some dude!"
do one where you get a private detective to find package thieves
Should put a bottle of that bank note ink inside that squirts blue staining ink all over them and their stuff
This is where it all started! :D
Where were the farts on the guy at the end?
Love it!
What would be worth the police s time?
Yooooooooooooooooo
Bc you used to work at N.A.S.A
"Sir, you are a genius and a hero and I salute you"
"Police: nope

Your Wallet: *bruh*"
"The police said this wasn't ""worth their time to look into""? Seriously???"
Were you able to retrieve it from the last perpetrator?
The couple after seeing all 4 videos: *Nervous Sweating*
So funny
"Mark rober in 2050: so i added a nuke, its a small change that will do just a teeny-tiny bit of damage"
And they never stole a package again
In soviet russia we use explosive+paints for this
"Do you have any of these for sale, Mark?"
I honestly cant believe this was 3 years ago.
No comments?
is their a chance i could order one of these
noice
That filthy animal deffinitely kept the change
pls sell this bro this is a dream for ppl getting revenge !!
"If Victor Von Doom and the Joker had a baby that decided to fight crime to atone for the sins of his parents, that baby would be Mark Rober."
buaetiful gliter
Only in America will the thieves make themselves out to be the victims.
"I Think in Texas They Don't Allow it, You Can Be In Prison For This And You Are In The News"
You made me scared of opening my own packages
you should use this glitterbomb on the forth of july.

And laugh at the run!"

6:27
Hey. I have enjoyed this video like three times atleast
those four guys definitly had a wide voccablulary
Lakeside since oaks
Purely socioeconomic factors.
I did not know HomePods existed 4 years ago
This is happening because you dummies defunded the police.
Can we just appreciate how Genius is Mark Rober.
Why did they blur the guys fsce
What if mark rober and the hacksmith colabed
"Genius, priceless for thieving porch pirates.  Mark you are simply AWESOME!"
The porch pirates are not just random people. Please be honest about this.
"This is ACTUALLY one the THE BEST things on the internet , EVER !!!"
so satisfying to watching. they get to keep 4 phones though. would be better if its somethign they can't keep
I love how the pirates laugh
I watched this in Spanish with my mom (thank you btw) and I never seen my mom interested in something I like I saw the squirrel one too!
couldnt they just take the phones inside
They deserved it
he is the best at making traps
I love kevin
You can probably make more of these and sell it to people who have problems with porch thieves
so the scammers walks away with 4 cellphones?
best saga
Why do all these porch pirates talk to themselves out loud?
There are many people in this nation who are scumbags and have a warped moral compass.  You are brilliant.  Please come speak at the school where I work!  I can't wait to see more.  Happy New Year!
i hate liars and thieves
"Ah, how far we have come..."
I need to buy one of these
This channel should be playing in every boring airplane trip. The hours would go by fast
This is genius lol
"So this is the origin lore of mark's glitter bombs, truly epic for doing god's work !!!!"
"""I'm gonna over engineer the crap out of it""






*4 years later*"
who's here after watching 4.0
"Who doesn't love glitter? Oceans. Fish. 

Microplastics are bad. And yes, unpopular opinion: they're worse than package thieves."
Amazing
the third dude has reformed and now creates his own glitter bombs
"6 months plus getting a package stolen just for an 8 minute video, respect"
Anyone come here from 2021?
6:33 hahagahaha
my favorite ones are when they open it alone and contemplate their life choices
Who u had In here 8:03
"Mark Rober, over-engineering the crap out of packages since 2018"
Where can I buy this
this video makes me want to see how long I can hold my breath
"Yo, can GlitterBomb v39.0 have a Rick Roll?"
Bro I saw your video and then my friend stole one and I let him open it
karma always comes back like a boomerang
Just watched this again after enjoying version 4.0 you are a genius and I love your videos. Keep it up.
Wish I had the resources to build stuff like this guy does :(
"Why did the police say it wasn't worth their time, whats the point of a police officer then??"
imagine they saw the video and they realized they made a big fool out of themselves
"Are you giving those 4 phones?
nooooooo"
ZMM on the ASX. 99% down. Awesome investment?
"glitter is too easy to clean up, it should be ink or something"

Is there a way to do this but with tear gas?
Use pepper spray. Hahahaha
Thanks for your efforts.
imagine if they just broke the phones lmao
That is AWESOME!!
"Its not over-engineered Mark, its absolutely GENIUS."
What is your freakin IQ?
"""My girlfriend's gonna get in here like who you had in here???"" **Famous last words**"
I LOVE YOU
I would put pepper spray
"He can make a magic delivery box, but yet he can't find a barber with eyesight."
AWESOME !!!
This guy is the reason I want to study engineering
YOU MADE CUROSITY!?!?!?!?!
NANI!?
3:20
I just wanted to say that this is brilliant and you're brilliant!!! I could only dream if being this awesome.
this is actually so funny that the thieves get pranked
Invest in RAN on the ASX. The next bitcoin?
BRILLIANT!!!
I'd love to buy one of these
"Yeah, I just don't understand America. Why people stole other people package?"
Who just go back to this video to be happy
"I hope they get some sort of punishment from the authorities, little stuff like this is the worst"
I have watched this about 13 times and still it is still interesting!
This ending is greater than the LOR ending
such a genius
He said that it sprays 5 times and it sprayed 6 times
"Brilliant, did any of these guys go to jail?"
Mark Rober andre turbea and vsause  need to be friends
I know you worked at NASA before your life love your videos
My hero!
Where can I buy it
The home alone bit is so funny
Cool
You should do something similar for pumpkin thieves.
Wow are you a brainiac!!!
"If he wasn't canadian, the 'glitter' would be something else"
This guy has to find a way to sell these things I would definitely buy one
I love you Mark
OMG  Kevin  I love that movie
"My kitten and I are watching this video: Kitten:Meow purr 
Me:PLZ STOP WALKING ON MY IPAD"
4 phones...
Next time use skunk juice! LMAO
The glitter should have been bed bugs
2 years ago
They should fill that spray box with raw sewage.
I literally peed myself watching this...so funny to see these idiots get played.
Does anyone have a file of the shipping label?  No reason...
This SO COOOL
WOAHGH
"Start selling it , put your idea in the market."
Love this!
"""DEM BROS HATES DAT STANKY THANG""! GREAT! NOW, make a box with 440 volts & 50 mps and melt these A-holes down to the BONE!"
"Wow I am sooo impressed, that's what those thieves deserve"
Ya thats what they get hahaha
This is crazy!
I get alot of packages delivered to my house. I love this video. That's what they get.
"Do you sell these?
I want one!"
"Why didnt u just make a mini camera instead of using phones?
Surely u can make a mini camera with all the phone abilities"
"If your doorbell camera doesn't do this

*Whistle on package theif*


Get Vivint smart security"
and thts wat ppl get for being thieves
If it wasn't for the robbers this video would never happen.
"i love robots and when he mentioned he built one and is on another planet,  my mouth was forming an O for the next 5 minutes."
Oh my gosh* :)
I love it! The reaction in the car is priceless!!
Where is the porch video from the group of 4?
AO Literally made fun of this.
Wow
A
This is truly the epitome of technology. All of human history has led up to this.
3:02
We watched this at school
i wonder how much the 4 phones cost..just used cheap phones i bet
"American house has no gate , why American house system has no gate ?. Not like others country house all have gate ."
wait I don't get the last one how did the phones inside the box filmed from outside the box. The who you had in here one.
"You are even in Texas news, very well done"
I think the last dude didn't even get it was a joke...
Could put something more deadly like some kind of gas that would knock them out or something... LOL
This is what happens when you capture the Unabomber no one fears taking a package
I want one!
This guy is my Hero! He's  being nice he could of  made the package hurt them.
"its unlawful to fill it full of shrapnel and powder assisted projectiles in case anyone was curious. yeah, im bummed too..."
Best video of mark rober .
I feel sorry for the people that have to clean that up
you should have placed pepper spray for some more zing

"luv u 
 




luv u"
This was awesome! Would be funny if the thief got heavily misted with water and dusted with henna powder.
Napalm woud've worked great in the tight confines of a car. You should really think about using it.
"yeah, I'm gonna stick to my suggestion for using homemade napalm or C4"
Shoutout to those crummy pirates featured in this video
In Germany delivery people aren't allowed to leave packages there without a signature from someone.
This was so awesome!
This is the dawn of a blessed weapon
"Why don't you and your genius friends invent a secure porch safe that bolts to the porch and has a lock on it. Of course, the mailman or UPS guy have to be able to get into it."
"I know like the phones can be tracked and all but I just had to ask.
Were they arrested or did they just get glittered and took all 4 of the phones :v"
You should start selling this stuff!
"Yo Mark, come up with a dye pack like the banks have. That would ruin everything !!!"
wait.... he built the mars rover???
glitter cmon!? why not paint or some other stuff that gets stuck and messy and just make them regret for real :P
"pre-made glitter bombs would sell.
Can we get the smallpox blankets option?"
Worth it for just the glitter
Love the slo-mo!
You been on the show tell the truth. I saw it today
you were on to tell the truth...
Nice appearance on to tell the truth
7:07
Bro trying to rob mark rober is the last thing youll ever do its like home alone mixed with dexters lab
You should have added a OH HELLO THERE and YOU GOT PWNED recording.
What's really scary is this won't stop the thieves.
"U work for NASA!
Omg"
Afknmazing
The only glitter use I approve of :D
"The materialistic recess rationally stuff because step-mother commonly preach than a shallow beast. steady, imaginary goose"

WHATS THAT SMEEELL
"Awesome. Love your videos, also 4:12 looks like a cool demo for how the Milky Way Galaxy was created."
I like how the person plays with the spinning thing I would play with that to
I love it when cops just say no to doing their job
Why would you even do that
When the glitter is out it looks like a galaxy
Genius
Yo mark got me and now my house full of glitter
the police should use these
"I like the little with sparkles coming out of a box at 2:04 
( On the circuit )"
These people are lucky in comparison to the 2.0 and 3.0 glitter bombs
This is so satisfying!!! Nice job!!
you spent about 7 minutes talking. we need more action less talk
"I have seen this several times before, but I just love the video of the glitter vortex. It's beautiful. I would like to see that recorded with a Phantom Camera. Oh Gavin, Destin, where are you?"
"0:45 The police say its just not worth their time to look into

Its wonderful that you can be the victim of a crime, and the people supposed to stop those crimes just ignore you"
"I just NEVER get tired of watching this...sigh. :-D Thank you...the word ""genius"" does not come close to describing this caper. Ha HA HA HA HA...!"
From their accents I would say they come from south of the border.
Cops are useless
But they get 4 phones out of it
These thieves ain't even hungry!
OMG LOL
Mark Rober President: 2024-10000000000000000000000
"""yes? Police, this Guy scammed me"""
Genius!
Jeez hownmany thieves have u pranked
I wish there was a foul spray that would last for 6 months. A continual reminder!
The ending is soo hilarious
"The picayune sing objectively arrive because bubble proportionally sneeze worth a obeisant ant. maddening, smelly octave"
LOVE THIS
"What is the ""KGB"" in the code?"
I don't understand how the police can say it isn't worth their time.  The effing law has been broken.  What is the benchmark for them doing their freaking jobs?
can you catch the catalytic converter thieves?
I literally like long time ago saw this in BBC
He literally caught those package thieves in 4K
4:10 i love that
"The rare scraper logistically phone because europe intraspecifically call under a many craftsman. terrific, apathetic neon"
Should do something like this for catalytic converters..
Every time I watch this video it is more and more satisfying.
Where it all started
"If instead of glitter I build an explosive, would I go to jail because the thief got innjured? I would totally maliciously try to get thieves hurt this way."
how does he know if is a she or he
"""It's just not worth our time to look into"" 
Our protectors folks."
Police: useless since forever! Smh
I love you
"The poised certification infrequently kiss because weeder distally injure versus a majestic drum. two, abandoned rose"
skip to the 6:00 part
"The mature white resultantly beg because seeder pivotally stretch amid a paltry package. subsequent, secret motion"
Mark needs to patent and sell this.
"The wholesale vessel immunochemically wreck because improvement proximately heap via a aware cemetery. giant, lovely pest"
Fun fact:Glitter was invented by Henry Branwell of the London Institute.
"The well-to-do grease additonally tumble because tub finallly escape underneath a direful bronze. raspy, nonstop beer"
Catching them in 8k
"The halting pansy intraorally work because editor atypically appear till a descriptive spike. hungry, wise rain"
This has 86 million views and yet he has 18 million subscribers
Imagine if the thieves watches your channel...
This is some Idea Batman would come up with! lol
i would use paint instead of glitter.
Those ppl on 6:36 need to watch their language
The video that started it all.
My new hero.
all porch pirates: what the fu*k
Me who found glitter all over my uncle's sofa
Great idea! I hope that glitter is biodegradable though. We all have to do our part.
He saying the same thing every video
I'm just glad he had this much time hahaha
"The impartial screwdriver allegedly greet because girdle customarily stretch past a thoughtful language. needless, colorful bedroom"
Now I will serche for these
Ought to put nails in it
Should have done poison gas lmao
"Hold up did you just say you spent 9 years making a thing and sent it to ANOTHER PLANET?!??! WHATTTT
0:54"
Excellently done
To be honest I hate clutter because well it broke something of mine I loved. but I do love sprinkles!
Kinda funny how my town is the home alone town
Pls sell these in amazon or smth lmao
"in theatre, we call glitter ""theatre herpes"" because once you get it, it's there FOREVER"

It will be epic"
OMG this is excellent!!! LOOOOOOOOOVE all ode to Kevin M and Home Alone!! BRILLIANT all the way around!!

Hi @Mark. Thank you for doing the wonderful work you do. You're a born teacher. Any chance you'd like to send one of these over to the UK?
You helped design the Mars rover
"Most liked video,but not wven close to most viewed"
I love this idea!!!
Extra fine glitter?!  You monster!  I am still finding the stuff from my daughters' art projects in my clothes.
This is 2 years ago?
YOU ARE SUCH A GREAT BILDER
The socially acceptable unabomber
"You need to live in a more private, safer, less trashy community if you're getting mail stolen like that."
What are you saying everyone love Glitter he said no one but I caught we love letters!
0:08 Is That A Phone?
So they still get four phones?

police: not worth looking into
porch pirates 3.0
Mark: ..so, I've been working with the FBI.."
Who is mark rober?
Dude how much monny must he have spent on phones for this
I want to see this but with mace
This is what Kevin McCallister  would do if he was an adult
vengeance is yours
5:57 the start of a glorious tradition
"Ive nvr even heard about porch pirates before. In all countries i know, the deliveryman would phone u up or at least leave a note about it. Theres even lockers for parcels to be collected from. Does the US not have them? The audacity of them being offended about the bomb is infuriating tho"
"""Who doesnt like glitter?""
Me."
Big brain
Anyone sad to see an LG phone
Did one get deleted? I swear there was another one
Wow. I'm a retired police officer and I find the police response to your request disgusting.
Saudi Arabia commits some serious human rights abuses but I agree with the chopping off the hand of thieves thing.
"I have never had this issue
1)All houses got gates out front so...
2)No one goes for walks like that, nothing to see

lol"
The dislikes are from the porch pirates
They should make a revenge package that takes these low lives out of circulation FOREVER. We need a social cleansing from these degenerates
What is WRONG with these people?
Theft isnt worth cops time? I mean i get it they deal with really serious stuff daily but sometimes people order 1000 dollar drones and stuff its not fair that people get to steal get caught red handed with actual evidence and the cops not do anything
"I find it both amusing and sad that ppl steal from each other this much in the US. Meanwhile, in Scandinavia (The Evil ""communist"" countries) can leave their babies in their prams out on the streets with baby alarms, and not worry one bit. Funny, eh?"
Watched this video and today we have an assignment on it hahaha
"Package thieves are some of the lowliest scum. Not just vecause they steal, simply because most of them look like they have no reason to steal. They're just doing it because they're cunts. I'd put an actual bomb if I could."
"Should be done with actual explosives, detonated by the police. Just a few weeks of that and porch pirating would end forever."
I used to hate glitter.  Now I really hate glitter.  But.... I love this video.
gods work
bakit kailangan pa magnakaw amp gege
Dislikes are from the glitter bomb's victims

"Please make more for the rest

"All these people should b arrested and put to the jail for ""rubbery""... don't take anything if it's not yours!!!!"
Instead of glitter he should have used paint

LOL you are a king man
"Wow, porch pirates are that common in your area?"
6:51 when you're right you're right
You should have ordered a real bomb or Grenade to kill those thieves
Hope those guys learn a lesson.
"Ok, now replace the glitter with acid for the next iteration"
Imagine if you bought this online  and someone stole it and got pranked
"Some thieves are prob watching and they be like

"""Why is the car full of glitter and smells like farts?""
""I got some really dirty hookers in there..."""

"At the risk of hyperbole, this might be the single greatest thing that anyone has ever done."

WOW  POLICE! BRUHH~sucks why they say this is not worth it?! where is the justice here
"Mark rober: darn porch pirates

Also him: it is big brain time"
This couldn't continue for long or people would start deliberately targeting your house for the phones.
he should rig it with pepper spray.
I wish it were an actual bomb.
How many connections this man has is unbelievable
I like marks cut
The dislikes are from the porch pirates themselves
You need to mass produce these. These need to be on every porch in the world

Mark Rober you deserve ten times the amount of subscribers than you have.
Imagine you've trained for years then helped built a robot to go onto a different planet then this is what you do with that incredible information
That glitter is polluting our surroundings with microplastics
Classic Marky right there
"That's less than what thieves deserve!

(I am kinda angry because someone stole 5 of our plants)"
Soooo the thief got himself 4 cellphones after the event?
"I had the same problem and seriously considered making something similar, except with chemical irritants instead of glitter. I thought about using a proper poison, but decided I wasn't gonna hospitalize anyone for stealing a package"
39k thieves thumbs downed this?

"Thank you SO much for cutting out the swear words, I wouldn't have been able to watch if not!"
Imagine if someone w bad intentions out anthrax in there instead of glitter. Is this where all the glitter goes?
Hey!! I saw that couple in another video. They were trying to steal but the owner had Ring installed so as soon as he shouted they ran away... And it was funny bcoz the girl ran in the opposite direction to that of the male....and then again turned and ran in that direction
omg i love this channel
Where can I buy one?
If my dad were to run into a glitter shooting system like that he would move to another planet.
Imagine if your neighbour who thought they were being kind keeping the package for you just got this happening to them lol
so much cursing on the 1st stolen one
I love the Mario mustache. Lol
Instead of glitter why not use used kitty litter out of a cat box
Imagine theyre parents see this?
Would love to do this in the uk london

It IS beautiful!!! Porch pirates messed with the wrong dude!
What a great video.
no saw traps 3/10 for hard work.
"i wonder why the cops wont take an interest in it even when you have them caught red handed, and yet if they did this same thing in a store, they would be arrested."
I would have made it an IED lol

"*opens 4.0
WERE NO STRANGERS TO LOOOOOOOOOOVE"

That would take them forever to clean up lol

Pention for mark just to make an entire vid with that spinning glitter that stuff satisfying
"They could use the glitter bomb technology for fires in California and other countries, 
I'm no scientist but couldn't they use the spinning effect on the bottom of water bomber planes somehow?
It would get more distance then just dropping water.   Just a thought I came up with when watching this."
