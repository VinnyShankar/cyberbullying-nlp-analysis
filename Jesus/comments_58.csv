Sooo satisfying
What if U drop someone and just turned it of when they were under the sand
It's like liquefaction
Now the question is is sand wet
I wish I was this guy's nephew
pls make something bigger
1:35 sand rainbow
Five years and the video still slaps
Whose balls you stole for the video
E
Bird apparently dies one minute in!
I love science
inhales a gallon of sand
oddly satisfying
POV; they stop it while your inside the sand
1:35 HOW DID IT MAKE A RAINBOW WHAT THE-
The ultimate prank: Throw someone in then freeze it.
if its not water how the f*** does it make a raimbow at this moment 1:32
the ultimate prank: put this in a gallon of milk
Hello
You are a drowng
it's mlik
literally the coolest sandbox ever constructed.
Is this how they moved the blocks to build the pyramids?
Boynce in French is la force de poussy
Water sand
*No sand was hurt during the creation of this video
Pharaohs curse
0:00 that rhyme
"Mark: it becomes a liquefied soup
Me: what soup isn't liquefied please tell me i am very intrigued"
This makes me hate sand just a little less.
pov me after eating tacobell
Is there any of these on crunch labs that we can buy?
You should tell us is this is on crunch labs
"To whoever thought about clicking away , SCIENCE IS THE AND I REPEAT THE BEST SUBJECT.I CARE NOT WHAT YOU SAY SCIENCE IS THE BEST!!!!!"
Dry water.
1:33 a rainbow
The solution to every kids dream of burying their dad in sand fast
MESSI
Basically quick sand
it looks like milk
I am very mad that I don't have this in my possession
Intrusive thoughts wouldve been telling me to eat the sand
Rainbow at 1:34
elephant toothpaste in liquid sand?
"white mud
sink sand"
"If it really is a liquid, you should be able to sink a titanic in it."
Hey
Cool.
ive watched this  20 odd times in the past 5 years and heres me watching it again
Do this for a sand litter box
photoshopped water
what would happen if we do a crossover between oobleck and fluidized bed
It seems so fun
Mark I love your vids
"Prank your child with this tell him to go under hold his breath, and then stop the air"
What is this
Anyone else here because you're reading Tress of the Emerald Sea?
1:35 Wow it's so Rainbow
nice cut scene to Jurassic park
Person drowns child in sand 1:46
Fun video but thats just 5th grade physics here in sweden
Now i get how quicksand is made
"SHHEESH
why you be maf"
SO SYNC HEHEHEHEEEHE
Where do you find the sand?
Question: Could it work with gold coins like Scrooge McDuck?
0:44 so satisfying
YOU CANT DO THAT haha Sand go berrrrrrr
THE SOCKS......... JUST WHY
U
I got sand in my nose
I want to feel that sand to bad
anyone still watching this after 5 years?
Can you make a omnitris  from Ben 10.
Science is awesome 6:07
This is satisfying
Ain't no way Mark put an Anakin Skywalker quote in the description XD
I love being mulled to death by science
1:32 anyone else see a rainbow?
Yeey!
Ahh yes because there is no water nearby so I spend 3 weeks make a liquid sand hot tub
Cool
Why does the iron float to the top?
You are a engineer
Mark can i do the smaller version of this as a school experiment for grade 8
Asmr
What the f###
Hi
What happens when you put water in it
"It absolutely terrifies me that he threw his nephew under the sand, I know the sand is aerated but just imagine. Do you see what I mean?"
Wouldn't it be a cool idea for a novel where entire oceans acted like this.
If you were a science teacher you'd be a master teacher.
The sand when it was at the beginning of the video what's the stuff they put on milkshakes
Quick sand: They made a knock off of me
Imagine in the future there are sand pools in specific parts of the world kind of like how KitKat flavors are limited in different parts of the world
Chinchilla baths:
All fun and games until 1 is swimming inside and they run out of air to pump
Now I know why onnet named it the buoyant bee
I've been tricked into learning!!!!!
Won't you have sand inside your foreskin ?
My brain: DRINK IT
Actually i enjoy science it's very interesting and educational.
sugma
If you touch it it feels like water
Ayyyyyyy messi ball
Do it again but put a boat into it :)
This is so fricking cool
Anakin Skywalker would hate this
Is that just me or does that look delicious?
I'm more interested in what the clean up looked like
At 0:37 he looks like mario
how much sand do you think they ate?
how much sand do you think they ate
Wow
What if when one of the kids was underneath the sand the air stopped going through and they got stuck in the dry water
Um I think the milk went batld
maybe this is how the pyramids were made
What bird
Am I the only one sad about the bird?
I am really concerned for that pigeon that sank in the grain
Imagine being able to say mark rober is your uncle!
Imagine you go deep down and the tank stops and you are stuck under sand and you can't get out
1:45 just casually dumping a kid in liquid sand
"this is the second vid i ever saw of mark I had ever seen 3 years ago, still as magical."
The ultimate asmr
Hay mark i want to do that. 3:24
Nobody going to tell Mark that shaggy is the strongest being in the universe?
THIS IS SO SATISFYING
how much for it
M I L K
Uhhh what if it gets in your pants??
(Quote of the day) never be to hard on yourself just to have fun with others
I am doing crunch labs
"It's like liqufied soup.

me: isn't soup a liquid kinda"
Ok that's great. Now I'm gonna need you to burn that Caillou figure
Quite interesting if I must say so myself
I wish you were my science teacher
""
I would belive you if you told me that was milk
Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh
"Does the saying get up in nose???
Also, it looks Busin"
Could you make a playlist of becoming the best uncle? I enjoy the videos but you have to scroll on your channel for a while to find them all.
Where do i buy it?
Bro this guy is like big brain 999999IQ
This is why I non stop watch mark rober
0:30 me playing with my balls at 3am
me
Is it my or does that air look like a nitrogen can
This is so cool
This is the best channel on YouTube
That looks fun
ASMR: 100
1:29  on the ball it said messi
so cool
Has anyone ever wanted to do something like this but never had this stuff growing up?
Liquified sand is the forbidden milk
AYO IS THAT CU-
l litery dremed abaot this last night
2023 and it is still so cool
I love your videos!
What is the sand make a rainbow though
Imagine if all beaches did that
I LUV SIENECES
Last to leave the fluid beach wins the beach
is it just me or do i want to drink it
Imagine the moment you put your hand in that while the air is on and you find out in that moment you had a cut.
This is awesome! Now do the same with coins so that I  see someone living my lifelong dream of swimming thru money like Scrooge McDuck.
Sorry the Terrain glitched.
I love all your videos and they inspired me to become an engineer
If you made it in a beach it probably will be quick sand you could troll people be using this method
Try to find a rainbow in the video
Idea: use this as an air hockey table
I swear if I got my head shoved under the sand in one of those I would probably threaten the person who shoved me more than a few times
5:40 let me put it simply for you. Light=no sink heavy=sink
0:57 Rip comrade
mark rober what about a pool of liquid sand
1:34 the rainbow!
I just know that sand will get everywhere
i want to do do this too
You should make a giant paintball gun
I want to drink it
This made my day
bro mark rober should have a asmr seperate channel!!
How do you make science fun and easy????
So cool
A whole pool of that would be awesome.
mash potato
I love sand baths
That would make a great defense system.
"you can't feel pictu-




0:18 *WHY DO I FEEL LIKE I CAN FEEL THE SAND*"
Forbidden Soup!
Bro turns on creative mode in these builds
The helium balloon also goes up because He weighs less than the air
use it for a treap
Imagine your walking on the beach and you just start sinking
3:45  is my favorite part
hi
make one pool sized pls
You cannot tell me this 0:20  is sand you have water proof hands and that is milk with glitter in it
sand pool
Tress brought me here
I already no how to Mack click sand
I don't think anybody's going to get this but... Tress of the Emerald Sea be like:
No not the Messi soccer ball
"I feel bad for his nephew's other uncles, they really have this guy as competition"
Worm sign!
The glair of the rainbow in the sand was awesome
cool
Pools in high jump pools are also pumped with air to break the surface tension otherwise divers would hit the water like it was concrete.
IDK why but this is making me kinda hungry
This is the real quick sand
*Forbidden Milk*
All I could think of was that classic video of the German guy jumping in a frozen pool expecting the top to break but it doesn't. Could definitely prank someone with this.
Iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Id love to see a booby trap version of this.
Bouncy force
He says it basically turns into a liquefied soup. I thought that soup was already a liquid.
Bro Made The Best Asmr Video
basically quicker sand
is it just me or do I just watch the video to see how much sand he spills
The sand hot tub is so satisfying
This is awesome
The sand even mad a rainbow when splashed
Once again I've found something I can't do because vxgina
If that wasn't sand I would devour it.
V
0:33 i forgot it was aand
I love you Mark
This sounds like it could be a medieval execution
RAINBOW! 1:34
"can we also just mention that there was a rainbow at 1:36 
A rainbow from Sand... pretty freaking cool!"
Hmmmmmmm?
Wait how does it make a rainbow
bowling balls float. sorry for being that guy...
Thx u for showing me somthing new that i dident know! u learn somthing new evryday!
My chinchillas dream pool
This is my kingdom come
3:30 His hand is literally going into the basketball.
"If you don't agree that the sand is satisfying, you've literally gone blind."
"Seriously, so frikking cool!!!"
when its in liquid form it kinda looks like milk
This was 5 years ago?!?
Who else saw the Messi ball
So cool!
This is why I understand Bounincy
What would happen if you stayed in there too long?
Rainbow
I bet your skin will stay exfoliated
forbidden milk
someone will figure out how to warm the sand claim it's therapeutic and make a mint.
"I never even knew this existed.

Also this is way more informative than any of the videos I've watched from Big Think so thank you for this!"
Burying objects= easy mode
Another attention seeker.
There is a very high chance that this video is responsible for sand worm effect in dune
This must be the next thing when you go to sleep
The dark prank: when someone jumps head first in to the sand stop the air
Nah this is quicksand
1:33 look the rainbow
soup is already a liquid so having liquified soup is an incorrect statement
Wow this is where sand made a rainbow 1:32
Literal quicksand 0:30
SUPER satisfying
my mind bro......
Is look like quick sand
The person that went under the sand.. how did they not go blind bro
I saw a rainbow
i wanna eat the sand soup
did he just say that stone cold beats shaggy? sorry bro but youre wrong there
The bottom of the sea be like
are your nephews ok? How could you just throw them in?
"Hey, greatest uncle, what would have happened if somehow the system broke while a nephew's head was under the sand?"
"so, quicksand or nah?"
I wanna be the FUN auntie!
Also can you try to do this to a beach like something like a prank.
I love science.     I always check your videos.
I imagine a great way to exfoliate your naughty bits.
"Me at 0:32 :HOW DOES THAT WORK I""M SO CONFUSEDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD :("
fortnite emote
Imagine how uncomfortable it would be when it gets in your butt.
"My teacher: can you make Liquid water but not water
Me:"
THATS INSANE
Ooh exfoliating. Till a cat shits in it.
I wish you where my teacher
Lol
Best uncle
Anakin would not approve of such things.
This is mindbending.
I wonder if chinchillas would love this.
"Wow, this is amazing. It's like you turned sand into water. Even looking at it, it is hard to accept. 
Thanks for the info. :)"
You dont know how many times iv watched this.
Anakin would not approve of this
"You just accurately described what most people think is gravity with your buoyancy description. Their is no gravity, only buoyancy, and electromagnetism."
This is amazing 0:43
3:10
Have you ever heard of Pneumoconiosis?
anakin: confused screaming
But does it clean dishes?
Liquid simulation with billions of particles.
imagine being stuck in it forever and ever
"Check out Tress of the Emerald Sea, by Brandon Sanderson. This is basically how the oceans (not water)work on that world."
So satisfying
California in November
1:32 it made a rainbow anyone noticed that?
Do you know about non utonian fluids
HOLY CRAP ITS QUICKSAND
1:34 I saw a rainbow
I wonder if it would be possible to make a smart watch like device that you could use underwater to find fish while spearfishing
Does this hot tub go back in time? Never saw that movie.
Bill Nye < Mark Rober
imagine an industrial size and falling in on the job.
The best and kinda scary prank:throw your friend in and turn off the air
You're amazing
thats so strange to look at
Hello  I'm  Christian  .can you make a robot that  shoots  tenis  balls
what language is that
I don't get it.
Beeing under the sand and having a powerout seems less fun..lol
He got some educations he got entertainment plus education
"For a minute there I lo...  was really puzzled by the sand rainbow at 1:33.
Until 2:35 when you mentioned it was actually glass beads."
You a beast in a weird rd way.
Sandy knobs
I learned more from this than my whole year in science class
"That shits the worst to inhale
Say hello to cilicosis"
5:20
1:45 is the kid ok?
That is soooooooooo freaking cool....aaaaaamazing
Be my sience teacher
Yay
It's water that's not wet...
Mark is just a future version of Albert Einstien
I would love to be a mark rober
"Omgggggg I needed this. Odd statement to say but I just kinda showed me how to make sand a non newtonian fluid??!!! I love particle physics and imagining Ufo propulsion systems. I kept hearing ""they're, like cern,  are using the wrong type of semi conductors.  U nerd type 2 to get around the Flux tubes. Type 1 won't allow movement within. I have excess natural dmt and see funny crap. One was a ufo thing but it said to use sand. I'm like are u freaking kidding. U want me to tell scientists they can use crap like altered prop of silica cubes/sand.  I'm shown cheaper ways that r more efficient using less energy but get more power using nesting resonance of fluids?? Idk. If u know more, lemme know. I just make tiktokx showing the weird visions I see. Hahaha. @higher_than_ur_avg."
4:45 And I promise that I will still like your videos becouse this is one of my favorite parts XD
Don't know why but just thought last to leave challenge would be fun
I'm jealous my mom is broke so we can't get all of the Materials 4 the build
Now make a sand glider.
Knowledge Is Power!! So Is College
"4:35 the best part my brain is like "" isn't it lovely """
So if the air pump stops working your trapped and cook!
"You get clean, get dirty, get and exfoliation all at the same time"
Best uncle ever
No one talking about how it's apparently possible to make a rainbow with sand??? 1:36
Please don't preface why I should stay and watch. That's the part I wanna click off for. I like science I hate begging.
Someone did this at a science fair that would be so cool to swim in tho they had a small tub to answer some misconceptions it wasn't rlly hot it was kinda warm but idk if u can control the temperature tho and when you took your hand out it didn't feel wet s it did when your hand is inside
The most important question is how a cat would react to this
bad bad idea
"Cool security system, make a moat with it."
Find memo NO help memo YES
WAIT SO DOES THAT MEANS TAT WE CAN DROWN ON SAND?
Oblack
If this didint make him the fave uncle then Idk what will
wow
Quem mais veio pelo shorts?
Mark you are the best
Most Satisfying Sand of the Word
imagine jumping in it then someone turns the air off
"You don't need air to do this
This stuff comes out of my body all the time"
We legit watched this in Science class today
So much science
And here I thought only Chuck Norris could swim through land.
1:17 this is what will happen to objects in water if they freeze their position
1:46 risky.
Future of Oceans
soup is already a liquid
Mark stole this idea from the Movie Escape Room: Tournament of champions..... Phony
new heavy water just dropped
No
Can you be my science teacher
All I gotta say is WOW
Incredible
1:36 rainbow..
cool i want an u buy on amazon?
"That was a risky move to throw your nephew head down in the tub, not too smart to be honest. If something went wrong with the air, he may suffocate before can pulled him out of the sand."
Who else wants to drink it?
Mark Rober I just love your videos so much you always make my day
what if it gets in your asscrack though
i rate this most satisfying video of the year
0:57 DID THAT PIGEON ENTER THE BACKROOMS!?!?!
Anakin would hate this so much lol
Make a pool of it
"Im gunna use this for home security, imagine someone trying to get across your yard and you click a button and then theyre in quicksand"
That sand rainbow though!
"Question: how do u clean it up?

Answer: you don't"
From what I've seen you sing like a great uncle I feel like all you need to is love that's it
Make one of these at home that's taller than you and say goodbye if the air accidently turns off.
"People: sand hot tub 
Hot tub: only sand?
People watch at 1:11: like milk frozen"
I mean two scoops of water
What happens if you put one water inside
"So far this video has 108,356,512
Views!"
Now do this to a pool
"""Teaaaaach uuuusss.""
""N-no no i dont really-""
"" *TEAAAAAAACH UUUUUSSS* """
I love since
What Does that feel like?
Do you know mr. Beef
Sand coffin jutsu
i always rewatch this video once in a while
Why don't we have science teachers like mark in schools science will be soo much fun!!
You should eat ALL the sand
I wanna see you put elephants toothpaste inside of that
I cant stop thinking about what would happen if the device making the sand vibrate suddenly stopped working while someone had their head under...
Asmr satisfied
A -DOG IN THE SAND PLSS PLSSSSS
"I was literally about to close the tab when he said ""Dont click away!"""
Science!
Bruh it looks liek milk
A TIKKA MASALA
Look forward seeing your nephews also coming up with cool science projects when they are older!!
I just watched the science bit because i love hearing you say buoyancy force lol
why is my subtitles in german
in 1:35 is saw a rainbow
Would it work with kinetic sand?
buy an ronaldo bal pls
It feels like it's only been yesterday but in reality... It's been 5 years.....
Do this across a property best security system
I love it
new video idea: making the entire desert a liquid
Quick Sand Condition is the reason for this
Does it still feel like sand
Its all fun and games until the air stops when youre fully under
"You know how sand is crunchy when you eat it, well when you eat  this sand it might be soft"
Anakin Skywalker wants to know your location
how much sand was eaten
How come he always has friends with broke pools a tubs
I do
Sand cube
Science Rex
he says: stay with me me be like: no
Bird+ grain soup= Bird gets swallowed
Sand+ Air= soup
What are their other uncles doing that you're not the favorite??
cornea ulcers will be happy
Nope
1:33 oh there is a rainbow :D
Don't worry I like science a lot that's all I do for everyday I do stuff yeah also I like to build stuff I've made all kinds of builds have made like Ping Pong machines I think they're called or whatever oh no not ping pong the ones where you press the button or whatever
This reminds me of the little trick my mom played on me that demonstrated volume by using two cups of different dimensions when I was just a lil guy hahaha.
.    *Am I the only one that hopes the birds didn't get hurt?*
Imagine being under the sand and the air just stops randomly
"me: having fun underwater swimming in the sand
*air turns off*"
Am I only one that want this guy to be my dad
Wonder if you could make it a heated sand box
You should have turned it off when they were under
I see horrendous safety incident with a small child.......
"Gravity vs buoyancy, don't let flat earthers see this, their brains will explode!!!!"
"Wait a secound, that is the way the Pyramids where build"
is not
"Very surreal to see because it looks like it should be wet yet it is actually dry, and boiling yet it's not."
mark remade quicksand XD
Same
Science is entertaining with this dude
another typo
typo
hand
its so satisfying the way it does attach to your hane
what happens if you dip your balls in the sand and try to get it out
So is this what quicksand basically is?
Anyone else here because they're reading Tress of the Emerald Sea?
Fascinating!
At first I thought he was going to say that vibration was liquifying the sand .. I wonder if it could?
there is no way this is real
i would keep small childrens away from it
So glad that I am here for the science and do not need to be flanked by a raptor.
"I would love to build this sometime...
this is epic!"
You might have mentioned that this is quicksand.
Did anyone catch the rainbow at 1:35?
The best part is who knew that just enough air would make liquid sand
nope
Those kids did something that no other kid has ever done in human history!
0:41 beat part so satisfying with the sand and music
Your the best
I wish I could be in one of your videos
I love your videos
You look so fun
It's all funny games until someone sinks to the bottom It's about to go back up but then someone turns off the pressure for example (mum) where's my kid last thing I remember was him playing in the sand pit with the pressure making it like a liquid i don't know where he went. ( kid) MMMMMMMMMMM MMMMMMMMM M MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This videos with boys posted 5 years ago
This is nice
Ummm no
"Just Wondering but if you did this in water, what would happen???

would it just do the same thing as people do to cushion divers falls into pools???"
sand in Ohio
I wonder when you're fully in the sand and then you just get locked
It's like living in your fever dream
"Anakin violently shakes in terror...
Also, now I know what an apocalypses on Lumar would look like..."
This is the solution to catching the super heavy SpaceX rocket that Elon Musk should be looking for.
Anyone else scared thinking about what would happen if the air turned off while under?
This has to be awesome for exfoliating
this gives me the quicksand willies but at the same time is ultimately satisfying
Til sand makes a rainbow
Simple
This is cool
would it make a mess on the carpet?
3:30 balls
0:35 Everything is satisfying
Wth.
"""On a quest to become favorite uncle..""
**shows clips of terrorizing children with inventions**"
It look very fun!
Anakin Skywalker does NOT want to know your location
So sparkly
What if he turned off the air when he threw his nephew in?
"Awesome trap. Someone triggers the window alarm, the ground becomes (LAVA) liquid and then stops when he is on the bottom"
I want him as my science techer
great vid
bro had to use a messi ball
bro imagine if there was a planet like that and the sand was the water :o
Throw a dog in the sand.......
"I clicked away because you told me not to click away ""if I think science is boring"" and then started patronizing me on why I should still want to watch, not because I think science is boring.
Take from that what you will."
uau
The ball was FOST
Imma study
I would not want to breath in all that dust
"no way thats sand, that is glittery milk"
I think this would be more of a pain in the butt than a normal hot tub would be.
1:32 rainbow
Why are you not my science teacher
I wish I had an uncle.
"This would make an excellent porch trap for the unwanted visitor.  Someone at the door? Turn on the air, let them sink.  Make it a 10 foot hole and you can decide how mean you want to be."
its crazy how this was 5 years ago but still feels like the new ones
Cool bro
RAINBOW
Anyone else saw the rainbow at 1:35
*Now put a human inside the liquidey sand and freeze it while they're inside.*
*tasty*
Is it me or the biggest nephew is so chill?
I don't like sand. It's irritating and it gets everywhere
Play rainbow friends
Hey I love your videos
my dad didnt came bacc with milk dis help lot
"so, wouldnt the sand grains go up your butt??"
7;9
It would be funny if he made it solid when the jumped in so they would get stuck in it
i wish i could do the same thing mark robert did
Hydrophobia water
"I can just imagine the sand getting EVERYWHERE
*shudders*"
"""hey mom can we get this in my room"" parents worst nightmare"
The first music is little dipper by Chad crouch
A
That looks like a chrome background
Water with extra steps
I lowkey want to take a sip
And I do know what you mean about the the air going up it's actually pretty easy science to know
Science is cool but the best science is medical science I just want to become a cardiac surgeon
You could trap a kid in that
At 1:34 he made a rainbow in sand.
@mark 3:37
I love your video
Thought it was bubbles
Liquid SaOup :)
I guess thats how quicksand comes to life...
I understand mark rober more than my science teachers lol
Pls teach me sicense or coding on games
Hey mark i'm doing a school project about where you make a custom pizza box out of school materials and have to keep the pizza hot for as long as possible any tips
Sand made a rainbow
Warum nen deutschen Titel aber englisches video
SAND BURIAL JUTSU!
Just to confirm it does work on a standard hot tub but it may break the hot tub I learnt that  the hard way
I feel like he's still finding sand everywhere.
Love the star warrs reference in the description
Who Else Seen the amazing Rainbow? 1:35
I feel like mark is Einstein reborn
HEY THATS LIKE OBLACK ingredients corn starch not to much and water
Really cool experiment
YOO THAT WAS SO COOL IT MADE A RAINBOW 1:32
"5:33 that's so scary with the context, he will dive even deeper than normal"
You really need to calm down with the subscriber and viewer bots...
this hurts my brain...
1:36 Rainbow :D
Who needs the beach i you have this
I would want to do this
I LOOKS SO FUN
I am a science nerd
Great alternative if your allergic to water
Our teacher made us watch this in science
The sand looks like milk
Bro dune be like
F
wacky
"Mmm, sillicocis. By the way, can't you do something similar [but on a smaller scale] to this with a powerful Lazer and  dust."
But how
kids disgust me
it looks like water
"he took ""play in the sand"" too litterally"
I want you to be my uncle lmao
Wu those it look sus
what if one of them were inside it and then someone turned the air off
Wait but soup is a liquid
Soo colol g
At school I hate since but when you do it's so much better
"0:05
duck:hello there"
friends : what did you do yesterday me: i went swiming i sand
I love this video because I am a powder coater and I see this effect everyday always wanted to hear it explained in detail
"I HATE SAND!
It gets everywhere!"
LOL SAND BENDING
"""I hate sand"" 
    Anakin"
I have your crunch lab
i usedmto watch this when i was a kid now im proud to see this video again
Dude the ASMR tho
the sand looks like water
I studied this in 8th standard and now remembers nothing
Me looking at the video is that cu-? Oh sand
Do that to ur entire pool@0:32
Brandon Sanderson sent me here.
Legends say he is still finding sand in places he didn't even know existed
what happend if the sand get in your nose?
perfect way to punish your kids
"In the description, you said ""I don't like sand. It's coarse, and rough, and irritating, and it gets everywhere.""
That was my exact thought. When your nephews went under, didn't the sand get into their nose and ears? 
I'm not sure I would be keen on snorkling in sand..."
I think i know how the pyramids were made
Normalize throwing politicians into 500ft deep fluidized sand pools
"""The top of the sand is nearly frictionless""

Cody Ko enters the chat"
What song is this?
You and your child gangsta in till the fire ant saw the sand
It's so freaking funny I love the Velociraptor part I love your videos to this is one of my favorites I watch it over and over
the sand bath looks like just a low frame video
Thats quicksand but uhhh.....Its more quick and it has more water somehow.v. So uhh thats how you create quicksand 2.0!
Would it hurt to belly flop into
Mark rover is like a mix between bill nye and that one cool family member
"Me: *puts a hot tub in public*
*Random kids gets in it*
Me: *presses a button to turn the hot tub to solid*
*Kid screaming because he can't get out*
*Me laughing*"
It doesn't even look like real sand
That is so satisfying
Please tell me you see this and try it. Pyramids? Moving heaving blocks with air?
"We basically learned the same science in science class. This is 100% cooler, more interesting, and just mindblowing."
Love your videos
"is it just me or is science and engineering both cool

"
I wonder if there is sand like this in heaven
I need to try this
fun
1:33 i love that
its just me or that sand look like a cream ?
imagine putting your head under the tub then they turn the sand off
does anyone know the vibration or frequncy of the sand
Here because of Brandon Sanderson's video
Doug's
"...I commented on this vid 5 years ago. But I'm here to comment again thanks to your collab with Brandon.

I'd love to see you tackle creating a fluidized bed with different color sands to mimic Brandon's spore seas."
scince is cool
Who's here from Brandon Sanderson's video?
"Nobody thinks science is boring mark, just saying that is condescending, human are curious by nature"
Yummy sand

I want to see your warehouse thibg
"Imagine for air like what we think of in the atmosphere not in the fluidized bed, that there is another state matter that causes the air itself to have the ability to flow."
0:55 rip bird
Imagine having a 7 foot deep version of that standing on it and someone turns it on
Wwe xd
Edited title:how to make quicksand
I am totally not jealous
"Revisiting this after reading ""Tress of the Emerald Sea,"" a story set in a world where the oceans are made of dust and underground vents are constantly releasing gas to fluidize it."
Here after reading Tress of the Emerald Sea! So cool to see this in action!
"Is it possible to scale this up further? Like could you make a ""sand row boat"" where you could make a boat float over sand dunes as you go? How hard would it be to scale it up further and also find a way to make the compressed air manually? I think you see where Im going with this. Could the pyramids have been made this way as far as stone transporting."
You are way better than my teachers
BRO MADE A SAND RAINBOW
I did not know sand could do that until today
This would be an amazing prank if you could bury it at a beach. Or a prank sand box haha
"Now picture this, a ""bottomless"" litter box. Cat steps in, activating a pressure sensor, takes a crap. Cat steps out, deactivating sensor, air turns on and crap sinks."
My Dad wants a montage of you clinging up the hottub
Opposite of affluence in a bad mark
What if you put a snorkel on you then go in and then put you head in with the air top still up there then pause
HMM MARK ROBER
You are the best  Mark rober
It looks more liquid than an actual liquid
Bro uses eny thing he gets his hands on
0:16 so is soup not already liquified?
"Yeh. That and vibration. That's why major earthquakes cause a phenomenon to the ground called ""liquification."""
Is the bird ok?
i wouldn't mind you being my science teacher either - emma
Alternative title: How to go blind  in 2 seconds
I was brought here after reading Tress and the Emerald Sea.
ok ok so imagine your under the sand and they turn it off
Imagine if the air suddenly stopped and someone gets stuck in the sand.
so that's how quicksand is made.
I learn stuff from mark that I would never learn in school
Tres of the emerald sea makes a lot more sense to me now
but what if the sand is wet
Anyone else here from Tress? :D
The fact that rainbows appeared in the sand
Throw them in and turn the air off
Is anyone here because of fluidization in Brandon Sanderson's Tress?
Anyone else here after reading Tress of the Emerald Sea by Brandon Sanderson?
Use showerheads as a floor of the container !
Perfect to empty a beach too crowded for your taste :-)
Its electro-statics . Not gravity .
This would be a cool trap
When the sand came out on 1.33 I saw a rainbow
Here because of Tress of the Emerald Sea
Do you think the pyramids blocks where moved like this or in some other similar way I really do believe Egyptians used this technology and the use of that technology is now lost to us
Mark is already uncle.
dry water
So it's quicksand?
THAT IS GALAXY SAND
So basically this is how Shara Ishvalda works.
"Considering shaggy was on the other side I think they still should have won, he was holding back."
He talks like the ai version of nile red
*L I Q U I D  S A N D*
imagine your foot bein caught under the tubes
Tress of the emerald sea? Anyone?
Fun
Any Tress of the Emerald Sea fans here?
Anakin Skywalker's nightmare
Was i the only one who saw a rainbow at 1:36?
"It makes me think if it could be some kind of ""Dry Pool"" concept"
"When you're in the mood to swim, but you hate water"
Quick-sand?
No way this was 5 years ago
"The phrase ""It becomes a liquefied soup"" destroyed the part of my brain responsible for logic."
Imagine doing this with kitty litter box
Imagine doing this with salt and season steak with it.
I DIDNT REALIZE THIS WAS MARK ROBERTO
I wouldn't want that getting in my vag though.
"I can already feel what it 8s like, I wish I was in there, it will be relaxing too"
It's like taking a dry bath.
It's frustrating knowing i would probably never see one in my life
this is very satisfying
Here is the conclusion to all the science: almost the same as water
This would be a great present for Anakin Skywalker. A tub full of sand.
un-wetted water
"the video is awesome but my brain catches on fire from frustration whenever the sand gets out of the bins because ocd and crap

edit: by ""bins"" i mean all the containers used for the fluidized beds, hot tub included"
4:27 lol
there is now a way online to build this
Is this patched yet?
Bro this is one of the many reasons he is the COOLEST person on earth
"Me:it's 5 AM i think I should go to sleep. 
Also me: *watches this instead*"
"Ultimate trap
Make that into sandbath"
This is like the Sandsea in Final Fantasy 12.
i never need to watch satisfying videos. just mark rober
Be my teacher
If Mark became my uncle then I would be happy
Looks a lot like ooblex
VAMOS VAMOS ARGENTINA GO MESSI
1:35 a sand rainbow????
"""Beware the ground on which you stand, the floor is quicker than the sand"""
I cant believe you chucked your son in it and his head went under. What if he breathed in??
This guy puts ASMR into nearly every video.
Sawdust or wood shavings would be safer and softer.
What if this was on a beach at it would announce on when the sand is gonna be like soup
you should consider teaching for schools. I'm sure students would like the interactive lessons that you give.
Einstein 2.0:
omg its BUTIFUL ! it looks like glitter !
0:32 liquid sand ASMR
people in brazil could of ate that sand and you wasted it
"This seems a lot like something I've been looking for.  Can you replace gravity with an elastic skin, and replace the sand with something with enough friction that you can pose or mould when it's fluidized, but otherwise have it retain its shape under the tension of the skin?  So that you have something you can turn to putty with the flick of a switch, and then lock in place by switching it back off again?"
I wish i was his cousin
assassin's favorite tool :)
"""I've never seen real quicksand"""
The subtitles are german
Big brain
Amazing video!
i hate sand
Anakin
Why is he playng with that c*m looking sand?
Getting stop motion vibes from this sand
Great desc :)
I learn with mark more than with school
I love the description and i agree
Maybe in counties with water shortages they could have sand pools instead of swimming pools
i would love to buy this!
i swear someone is gonna put this in the ground at a playground and just turn it on when unsuspecting kids are there
Bull shaggy would totally beat stone cold Steve
"Imagine to build that as a burglar trap. If a burglar walks on your ground, you just switch it on and when he is sunken in to the shoulders you switch it off until the police arrives."
Dried water or un-wet water
Come out from clothes
WHERE CAN I ORDER LIQUID SAND?!
Love all of your videos mark
0:57 : is that bird ok?
"You could just make a giant version, put someone at the bottom and then just turn it off and leave, and they would just be trapped there."
VFX class 3.0
What would happen if you throw a person head first then the air cuts
Is it just me or do I just want him to be my uncle?
"My electricity is out and I've been sitting in my sand pool for 3 days, could someone pay my electricity bill? it's not only getting boring but cold.

Hej Mark thank you for your cool ideas, when you open a summer school in Europe, my son wants me to book a weekend with you."
Is it just me or does that sand look delicious?
But can you make water into sand? Snow?
"This would be so fun,"
And?....
Am I the only one that wants to be his child
Imagjne if they did this to a crowded beach
0:56 those were his final words to us. we never saw him again...
