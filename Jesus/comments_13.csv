That kid look like he training those animals to work for his Aryan youth camp
i have never laughed so much in my life! i am also like kevin i just cant hold animals
Robert is obviously braver than Kevin
Thos is infuriating. Just sit TF down and do this
"Has Jimmy and Kevin ever done a movie together? If not, they need to."
Talks just like his dad
1:50
"i love love LOVEEEEEEEEEEE kevin hart man I laughed , jimmy is hilarious too! and no thank you on that spider , nope me either I would not have that in my hands"
Robert doesn't even have the time to talk about anything because the other two are being so damn hyper.
"I get being scared of a snake or spider, but an ostrich?
Come on!"
Kevin Hart ruins so much.
Conan would nail this
Kevin was so scared that Jimmy had to remind him that he was cussing and threatening a minor!
funniest thing ever
"If Kevin has fear from animals, then why does he have two Doberman Pinschers that he walks with"
Kevins movie characters are him..
"Damn, then that spider came out... i was like ""WHERE IS MY TOMMY GUN!!!!""."
That's me every time around animals
steve would be proud of robert
"Nobody's talking about the king snakes being named after people nicknamed ""the King"""
"Love Robert Irwin, he would be like the best friend for adventures"
1st had to be an ostrich hahahahah
Stresssssss !!!!!!
"This kid with the world of creepy crawlies, and then two adults freaking out is hilarious."
G-money G-Tag wants  to buy this one
Black man scared of african bush animals
Inwould be chill with everything except spider dude. I cant with that just hard pass
Kevin Hart clearly ain't gone be able to survive in the wild
Cry baby
I could listen to him talk about all these animals all day long it's so interesting
"I with you, Kevin!"
I feel for Kevin Hart LOL
Baby Ostrich sounds just like a Dilophosaurus.
Has anyone mentioned that the baby ostrich sounds like the Dilophosaurus from Jurassic Park?
"Kevin Hart is the epitome of black men, we don't play with wild animals"
I fully expected Kevin to just pop out of that glove and run away
LeBron was probably laughing his ass off watching this
Is this the greatest moment of televised history ?
Lmfaooooooooo I'm still laughing.  This is gold
Grown men acting like little girls.
Super funny
Is this just an act to get attention or is he really so afraid of every animal?
Why does this man have so much fear of animals??!
kevin is so annoying made it all about himself and we didn't get to learn about those animals from this wonderful kid he is so mature for his age
"This is overall really funny, but it does eventually get really tiring that Kevin wont budge an inch to interact with most of these animals.  Robert knows how to handle them and has been doing so his entire life. If he says you're in no danger, i would be inclined to believe him. Those animals were EXTREMELY calm and wouldnt have been brought on a live tv show if the keepers werent as certain as they could be that they would be okay out there. Those are ambassador animals and have been trained and conditioned to stay calm and nonagressive in conditions like these. Just a little tiring with all the shouting and screaming and stubbornness when this dude is just trying to have a nice time and educate! Kev!!! Let robert hand you an animal!!! You can do it!!!!!!!"
the soul of the crocodile hunter lives on with his son
That baby Ostrich sounds like the Dilophosaur from Jurassic Park
That's the funniest thing I've ever seen
I just realized that the baby ostrich sounds just like a Dilophosaurus.  I probably didn't spell that right but whatever...
This is still the funniest episode ever.
Robert & Bindi... God bless 'em.
robert irwin was just dying laughin at kevin's foolish A
Kevin needs to calm down man lmao
Kevin Hart is absolutely hilarious!!
This was the funniest thing I've seen in a while!!!
Rob is one of my fav people in this world.
Family guy. Zurkze  you know what I want gets motorcycle
Greatest video ever
Jumanji 2
I am so impressed by this young man. Stepping into his fathers foot steps and being so mature. His father would be so proud
Bring Kevin a Puppy
"Ok, but this is really mean to Kevin. I'm sorry, forcing someone to interact with phobias like this can be incredibly damaging."
"Jimmy has a lottta respect

While kevins"
Baby ostrich sounds like a dinosaur
Jimmy is acting but not Kevin!
"I'm with Kevin ... no, no, NO!"
i have the biggest crush on robert omg
I met Bob bindi and Terry last week and they are the best people ever!
Kevin hart is so funnu and down to earth genuine some of the comedians gey a attitude
Robert was only 14 here?!  He was so mature!
Kevin hary was very annoying.
I hate Kevin after watching this
whats the title of that The Roots song at the end part?
Imagine if he brought out an alligator or a croc. Hart would have a Hart attack lol.
did no one else see Kevin almost fall as the hawk came for him
I'm with Kevin. Don't force people to conquer fears they aren't prepared for.. there's a reason I'm not an animal handler
JIMMY GET IT!!
14:00 Lol @ Kevin Hart's face.
"Just one word lol ""Jimmygehit"""
Kevin is such a wimp but steve would be so proud of Robert
Oh my gosh!!! I had to watch this twice!! So funny!
Kevin was a little annoying here
He looks like his dad. Glad to see he's walking in dad's steps. Looks like a good young man.
Have you seen how Robert looks recently
"kevin heart is one of the worst comedians, dude is trying so hard to be funny"
I love how Kevin seamlessly blends comedy with fear. This is brilliant and Robert is such a troll to Kevin haha. He showed respect and willing though. good guy :)
"Cluck, cluck, cluck. The yellow streak is showing"
This is one of my favorite things on YouTube. I come back to it whenever I need a smile.
"The snake and falcon I would have jumped at the chance to hold.  The spider?  You'd see me do a superman out the nearest exit.  I have always been scared of spiders, but little else.  I dont know why.  I can jump out of perfectly good airplanes, I can lob grenades with ease, and everything else in between, but for some reason, it stops at spiders."
10:13 *JIMMAY*
I actually can't stop laughing!! This is hysterical!
I wish they let Robert talk a bit ab the animals instead of interrupting. Funny show tho
This is hilarious!!!
3:28 I like that Robert says it like it's Kevin's turn to get on the swing
Lol I still remember when he was a baby. So like his Dad.
"I know the whole ""talk show host is afraid of animals"" has been a gimmick for over 50 years of talk shows, but this takes it to a terribly annoying level.  Kevin Hart is just the worst, and Jimmy Fallon is not much better.  At least when Letterman, Carson and Conan had animals on, they still handled them all, and when they were apprehensive, they had good jokes.  These two men are just loud, annoying animals."
COME ON K. H. THAT YOU HAVE TOO OVERCOME YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE
OMG I REMEBER THAT THE V. THEY MEET K. H. IN A HOTEL
Robert is so sweet
Why are they so afraid of everything?
Pair of cowards. Mericans have to be so fooking loud. Frigging morons.
I just hear a baby ostrich for the first time and all i can think is the Dilophasaurus from Jurassic Park
SO THATS WHERE THEY GOT THE DILOPHOSAURUS NOISE
"i love him,,, i adored his dad,, watched him all the time,,, Steve was so animated and fun and REAL....  too cute and fun.. glad he took after his dad,, its awesome,,,,"
jimmy loves to over-react and act on these
Is Robert Irwin the late Steve irwin son????
*_The black guy overdid his act. Not a bit funny._*
I think Jimmy Fallon has a fear of spiders
"10:22 Haha, slaps the table, but then hurriedly runs away!"
"5:32 Well, he got closer to the animals than Steve Harvey did!"
"3:02-3:06 Haha, a lady hysterically laughing in the audience at Kevin running around and then Jimmy doing pushups."
I am so proud of keven for doing the last one
Tells you something when a 14 year old aussie has bigger balls than two fully ass grown Americans
its frustrating me that they keep cutting robert off while hes talking anout the animals
Sghddghgffhhtdghffghhfdfgytdfggggfrfgyffftghhggrfgygffghgghhghgggggyggfffffgggrgyhyhgffdgggyftrfgytrggygtfgyhgghhuhgttyhhyyyytfggg
Kevin Hart is smarter than all the Irwins together. My favorite animal is most definitely a stingray!!! They are known for taking care of wildlife idiots who are asking to get killed by an animal!!
That black guy is a coward !
Damn that was hilarious!
Their electricity bill from APLAUSE sign must be huge.
"Jimmy just went through the after effect of shock! I love Kevin, he is a true black person, we run away from shit, not into it!"
Kevin Hart is the biggest puss ever
Jimmy's bravery is fueled solely by another person being more afraid than him.
I'd trust him. I'd be all over the animals he shares. Hart is trying to be funny but he's ruining it.
"KEVIN HART: YOU AINT GO KISS MAH ASS
EVERYONE: AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH"
Of course.
"Kevin Hart thinking the whole time ""this type of shit is literally what killed your old man"""
I'd argue the world's largest bird is the giant chicken standing next to the ostrich...
What a Wuss
Kevin don't be little girl..
I'm much more afraid of birds that I am snakes or spiders.  Birds are little dinosaurs and I don't trust them.
Kevin Hart annoying af
Now this is entertainment
i love how small kevin looks on the wide angle
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Kevin has no respect. He ist an Idiot
The funniest thing I've ever seen!
Absolutely hysterical! The young man knows after his father learned. It can't be a skit.
Jimmy get it!
Kevin is the most kind person on the world !
Why did the baby ostrich sound like the dilophosorous from Jurrasic Park
"So the snake is actually called ""LeBron""?"
"Kevin Heart and Chelsea Handler hate Hate Snakes. They won't go near a snake.
They are both deathly afraid of Snakes."
Exaggeration for the show this was annoying
"Kevin yelling ""JIMMY GET IT "" and Jimmy doing his outro is the best ."
kevin ruined this for me . annoying
Looking like the perfect mixture of his mom and dad lol poor Kevin
"Just hold, touch, pet at least one of the animals. It's not that serious. Black ppl are scared of everything lol"
JIMMy JIMMY bang bang bang on the table omg lolololol it's taken me 50 minutes to type this I couldn't type for laughing omg my stomach is killing me from laughing Jesus mary and joesef that was the funniest thing I have ever seen
"This is surreal. I fear people like kevin fears that snake. Meanwhile I love snakes and spiders and pick them up all the time.

It honestly makes zero sense. Humans will rape, murder, or torture you just for fun. All that snake can do it poke you."
this is so funny. Kevin is afraid of anything that moves. Too funny!
litttle midget fk is so caward
Yeah I'm with Kevin about the tarantula. No on so many levels.
Robert shares the same love and passion for animals like his father did. You could hear it in his voice with every animal he described :)
that's a creepy chirp
"Kevin Hart is too much... This was an act, and a bad one..."
I really love Kevin he is so funny and Jimmy too Robert is also really patient he is amazing
Black people being scared of animals will never not be funny
This is so funny.
Robert Irwin needs to be on EVERY time Kevin is there
"would marry robert TODAY (but like, now Robert, not 5 years ago Robert). today."
OMG I am a woman and have held snakes before. He's not asking u to hold an anaconda  these snakes only bite if they're chasing rats (food) or if you do something aggressive to make them nervous or feel like they have to defend themselves.
Kevins villain arc:
The funniest parts are when Jimmy tries reassuring Kevin while definitely being terrified
All Jurassic park fans recognize that baby ostrich sound
Glad steve irwin is basically still alive
"Overcome your fears...
Go slap that cop ove dere.
Urrr...Nah thanks...I'll keep that fear."
"Robert is a brave Young man, yay Robert! ."
Kevin Hart ruined this - he made it all about himself.
This is seriously one of the funniest moments in TV history.
Any how did Kevin ending up in Jumanji ?
what happened to jumanji then?
"poor Jimmy, I couldn't do it, nope.. no f***ing thank u.. if they were fuzzy cat tails it would def help, do we have those instead plz"
I really want to meet Robert one day and meet all his animals. He seems very cheerful to be around!
kevin is trying to kill jimmy
Robert definitely takes after his old man cool calm & collected but also so passionate & excitable about animals. Definitely a chip of the old block. I'm sure his dad is looking down beaming with pride
"I'm with Kev,  fts!"
Kevin is an overreacting shit.
0:18 You can kiss my ass man!
Kid must be thinking why are these grownass adults behaving like kids
It's hilarious watching Kevin Hart turn white!!! I've never seen anyone lose color quite as fast as him. Lol.
"Robert's really cute, a real lady magnet heh <33"
When you walking through the hood just pull out a snake
I truly believe Kevin Hart rode the short bus to school
I never get tired of watching this
I cant stop watching these
"Fly my pretty, fly fly"
Good birdie
You can tell Robert was a bit annoyed after Kevin started smacking the desk when jimmy had the tarantula.
Kevin just stupid
"If Hart's fear is just an act, it gets really tiresome. Otherwise he's just a flat out coward. Of course, he's only about 5 ft tall."
Hihihihuhi
I laughed at this until I cried.  Kevin and jimmy were so hilarious and Robert was so calm and knowledgable with his animals.  It was such a great part of the show!!!
Number 1 funniest night
"He saw the BS coming. 
Kevin it's your turn...
No it's not!"
"Jimmy, you are so smart and gentle..Robert, remember how your father had passed away..so be careful pl..cos you are so valuable"
"OMG IT FEELS LIKE THERE IS A TARANTULA ON MY HEAD AFTER SEEING THE TARANTULA, MY BOX BRAIDS LOOK LIKE THE LEGS"
I want to see h8m with a gorilla up there
Kevin Hart is a child
I swear Hart is the biggest wuss I have ever seen on or off screen. He's funny about it but he is such a scaredy cat
Robert is ok but this show is lame despite Kevin Hart being a good comedian. They are doing the black man scared of white people things trope and it isn't convincing that Kevin is genuinely afraid.
Why are celebrities such big sissys
"Roberts energy is so infectious, Steve really would be proud. Also, kevin and robert should do more wildlife conservation type stuff tigether. They would rack up the views."
2 grown @$$ men terrified meanwhile a 14 year old boy worlds with all these and so many more without even batty an eyelash!!
Title: Kevin heart get chased by zoo keeper and his animals
His accent suits the program! Both their personality fit so well together very funny!!
"Come on hard pull it together! All the things I would think about you I would never think you're a poopinshit! 
Grow a pair bro!"
Kevin having Nebraska Ostrich Flashbacks
Sorry but the way jimmy just casually started doing push-ups is killing me 2:59
"I wish I was a guest on nights like this cuz I would totally hold, those I'm able to hold, each and every one of these beautiful animals."
Ppl in the back are idiots
Lol
"I can handle spiders, but snakes. Those are my Kryptonites."
This was so funny omg lol
He lost me at the snake. Nope....
Pay back for the Rollercoaster
"This one had me SCREAMING,  dude would say ""it can kill, now come hold it""?"
That's how people die!
kevins reaction jajajajajaja priceslesss ajajajajaja
Kevin needs a giant kick in the balls for screaming at the tarantula when he was told not to.
"Kevin needs to live in a bubble, he's probably scared of ants.
Queenslander."
"""make sure u dont put ur hands up"" *everyone starts clapping*"
laughed my ass off
They're scared of everything.
Alooks exactly like DAD
Kevin for real just tried to run away from his own arm
"At first it was funny, but at some point, let's give Robert an opportunity to have his moment and teach what he came to teach."
"I thonestly think that bringin animals to tv shows thing is just wrong. for some reason it bothers me, especially kevin heart's behaviour in this particular clip. does anyone agree?"
"Kevin hart really rubs me the wrong way. No respect, it's not funny."
I think Kevin Hart is developmentally challenged
That Kevin hart is a douche...
When the bird was on Kevin has Jim ever been like Keeeeeevvvviin keeevviiin !
That was kevin heart stunt double
The audience needs to stop quiet when animals are being shown. The guests should show some respect for the person showing the animals.
"Wow, he looks so much like his father!!"
I'd love to pet and hold all of those beautiful creatures :)
5:39...Dropped the f bomb! Impressive.
Don't ever watch Kevin if you took a fluid pill!
Robert speaks and acts exactly like his late father
top coon award. over acting azz
The baby ostrich sounds like the Dilophosaur from Jurassic Park
Who on earth  play with  snakes
Kevin's trust issues skyrocketed here
Absolutely hilarious
Is good that Robert still do with the animals like his dad I sure miss his dad always loved watching his show about the animals and he still doing it it's all from the his family still doing this
Is awesome Kevin was so funny he was scared and everything but he did do the owl I couldn't do the spider
"Typical scared of dogs, cats, everything.  Small brain."
"Sad, Jimmy is more of a man than Kevin is..."
lol these gosh darn yuppies are hilarious!!
Big red so big
Do you have a crocodile at jimmy fallon
Oa
He is just like his dad OMG it's kricky lol I love it
Damn right mm yes
I completely forgot about the bit Kevin Hart talked about being chased by an ostrich
Fellow animal genetics are threatening to survival instinct!
Kevin is so ridiculously annoying. He just talks too much.
We couldn't get Becky Sluga out of the boat as we were casually rafting down the rogue river in Oregon 2022
My sister in law acts just like Kevin
Kevin is such a big Nancy about those snakes
Why is Kevin afraid of a little bird?
Robert Irwin is a national treasure that must be protected at all costs.
"Jimmy is really brave and Kevin  is hilarious . what a good show , and Robert is so sweet.. Best Jimmy Fallon show. for sure l"
"Robert doing literally anything:

The comments: YOUR DAD IS DEAD"
Will Smith is hero.
This is the show of the century. I e watched it a million times and I laugh so hard I cry
I'm with you Kevin I'm scared of animals to snakes frogs lizards big dogs I like little dogs I have to miniature dogs but all those exotic animals I don't like those I'm afraid of those
Steve Irwin would be proud of robert
This kid is cooler than I could ever hope to be.
Isit me or does it sound like a bloody dilophosaurus?
2 grown men acting so pathetically toward such beautiful creatures!!
"Legends say , they didn't get Falcon off of Kevin and he keeps saying ""Jimmy get it"" throughout the day"
I've seen the videos of Kevin being scared of animals hundreds of times and it gets funnier everytime I watch it.
"I used to own a Brachypelma hamorii and my best friend acted exactly like Kevin everytime he ""had to"" visit me. :D"
That thumbnail he copied the Leonardo DiCaprio meme
"When i watch Robert i see his dad, love his work and altitude"
Kevin is still alive though
Hmmm both gone down in my opinion a little bit. Man up. Evidently animals don't mean shit to either of them. Just money.
"I don't like when people MAKE Animals do ""Tricks"" Especially in an Unnatural Environment. Not funny."
The tarantula not reacting to Kevin Hart's yelling surprises me.
Irwin sounds like his dad. Gorgeous animals.
"baby ostrich: casually chirping
kevin : *she's saying I want some little black man*"
Baby ostriches sound like the dilophosaurus from Jurassic Park  :3
"Imagine being so scared of such a tiny animal meanwhile its surrounded by 100s of murderous meat eating destructive apes shouting and screaming, well done animals."
Kevin Hart is hilarious when it comes to animals. So very funny
He still traumatized from that one ostrich that chased him over a pen
They know that Kevin don't like that kind of animals. I see it as kind of bullying
Kevin Hart's fear of everything is so hilarious! Laughed my rear end off.
I absolutely positively love Kevin hart he was great on this
At 8:40 when that spider come out all Kevin can say is stay stay stay pmsl
4:30 Jimmy: U do the next aaannal
"""Can they bite?""
The most common question I got when I worked at Petco.
Answer: Anything with a mouth can bite."
At least Jimmy had pretty good pushup form lol
Ok but why do Jimmy have to be overreacting when the animal expert takes out the spider
i love how rob is so calm with the spider while jimmy is climbing a wall to get away and Kevin is yelling at him like a dog lol
"Kevin Hart's number one most adrenaline rush of his entire life. 
He'll for sure never forget that"
lol kivin is a whuss xD
After the first 2 minutes I wanted to slap the shit out of that guy Kevin!!  Talk about annoying!
IM DA BIGGEST BIRD IM DA BIGGEST BIRD
The ostrich was personal for Kevin haha
I think Robert's famous dad would be proud but hopefully history won't repeat itself with him meaning a seemaler fate as his dad did that would be terrible! Wow! How much Robert looks like his dad just a younger version of Steve Irwin not that Steve Irwin was old at the time of his death I've heard that Steve was only in his 40s at the time he died and that's not that old at all.
i love this so much
JIMMY GET IT
I love Kevin in all of this..
When they were saying a soft and cute animal I straight away knew were talking about a tarantula
Can anyone read jimmys lips after kevin cusses?
"14:08 ""Yo, look at this!"""
"""JIMMMYYYY"" That got me laughing my arse off"
Is he serious or just acting?
"As much I was expecting, I'm glad he didn't do a ""whooo"" as to keep attention to the animals."
So crazy Robert took after his father in spirit.
legend says Kevin is still saying Jimmy get it to this day
"Kevin Hart is just a big chicken, ask yourself, would the Rock act like this? Answer is he-- no."
very dramatic and cringe video - he is just acting as if he got scared -- bull sheet
That was so funny
8:39
"This video one of the funnist and hilarious thing in my lifetime i never booring wathing it agian and agian 
KH its just legend funny man alive to me"
Kevin's a puss
"Should have had the rock on to compete, that's better peer pressure XD"
Good job Kevin! Thanks for all the laughs!
"John 10:9
I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture."
Kevin Hart screaming Jimmy when Jimmy was holding the tarantula needed to stop. A little respect for the spider would've been great.
"6:47 ""make sure you're really nice and calm' . . . That is not something Kevin does. ever."
"My God Kevin, I can't believe you were scared of Robert's animals. You defanged a black mamba, crossed a bridge with alligators snapping at your feet, survived getting trampled by rhinos...sort of, and rode on an elephant calling Van Pelt a bitch."
He is one of the funniest people with an immense range of expressions Ive ever witnessed
Why is it always the trope of the black guy who is over the top scared of animals. I'm pretty sure it's a bit
Kevin Hart being a total wuss and yelling NO! and carrying on is so damn funny!!!!!!
Why did Kevin bother going on the show - he must have known what was going to happen.
"For all that this was, one can tell when the fear is genuine and when the fear is a joke. With the snakes, the fear was genuine. Kevin Hart might very well have a phobia of snakes."
I was expecting the eagle to swoop in and take Kevin off to his nest.
Jumanji Vibes all over again
This sounds like the dilophosaurus from the First Jurassic Park film
"Kevin's inner voice is screaming ""y'all know niggas hate snakes!"""
"People say that when I get scared,  words just flow out of my mouth. Never have I been in this position as Kevin Hart. I definitely would be thinking and saying everything that comes to my mind or anyone else. Hysterical. Thank you for a great laugh."
im only watching this for the australian accent and how freaking funny kevin hart is
Hart is a city guy
"""If you don't design your own life plan, chances are you'll fall into someone else's plan. And guess what they have planned for you? Not much."" 
https://youtu.be/kp8Xz85RBLs"
This kid obviously didn't watch Kevin Hart's specials
"Man, this is the funniest episode ever. Kevin, you look way more nervous than an average guy, no offense"
"THE END LOL
kevin: ""JIMMY GET IT. 
JIMMY GET IT. 
JIMMY, GET IT
JIMMY GET IT"""
RIP Steve Irwin.
That tall skinny dude from home alone movie when a spider was put on his face
"aussies have no banter, but kevin heart kills me in this hes so hilarous"
Loved this video
Their ancestors who fought mammoths be like: -.-
"imagine being so obnoxious and undereducated that ur terrified of something >0.01% of your own weight.... i've never been more disappointed in two full grown men- wait, yes i have. men are so annoying. I'm on Robert's side here. the King snakes were perfectly well behaved and the red knee tarantula was completely polite, and also lovely! men are so boring and exasperating. also, yes, i assume this was all scripted and all that nonsense. it's just silly to me that we continue to assign shitty OH SO SCARY ideals to species who are completely harmless to humans."
Seeing Kevin Hart being such a fcking coward is so annoying. What a princess.
"I would love to hold Red, so proud of Jimmy....Kevin you %$#@"
He was high as a kite that night!
How was Jumanji (jungle) for Kevin?
I love keith hart he funny as hell.
A gem : kevin hart
literally grew up hand catching snakes and snapping turtles and alligators.. Spiders were always the homies keepin all those pesky flies n things away.
As a grown man who was raised in the south n florida.. These are a group of girls and the only man is steves son... lol
Robert is the exact carbon copy of his dad Steve Irwin!
How amazing mites
its incredible how ALIKE Robert is to his dad in looks and also attitude and excitement. truly keeping his dads legacy alive :)
the amount of overacting on this is unbearable
Robert is a spitting image of his father and has the same charisma. He will go far.
JICK ALL THEIR ASS OUT KEVIN
Take your ass animal out
KICK THEIR ASS KERVIN YOU CAN SICK
Kevin is right put their stupid animal away
I had a tamed huge butter snake around my neck when i was 13 and I'm skin and bone I'm weak and whippy but this guy this big beefy man is scared of a small little snake this guy who could most likely beat my ass up is scared of a snake he might not last out in the woods I'm guessing 2 days
This video is unwatchable. Kevin got really annoying.
Kevin Hart what a dick what happened to your strong mindset?
Now I know where they got the chirping sound of the dilophosaurus in Jurassic Park
Nothing funnier than reality
Hilarious
Tarantulas are sweet things. Had one as a kid. Very cuddly and soft.
"Poor Robert is trying to teach them about these amazing animals, but of course Kevin is making it all about himself again"
Most stereotypical video of all LOL
I wanna hold big red
"grown ass man actin like a baby lol, frig snacks kevin"
"This Kevin hart He Is So Funny
I Know Thats Kevin Hart Is Scared Of Animals Im Scared Of Animals
Two Im Scared Of Everything
I got so much sweat
Dripping down my ass right now."
And Kevin Hart is funny and Cool too
So cute and cool
Im sure you will love this guy.
I will compare Kevin Hart to my brother because they both scared of animals
Sounds like a Dilophosaurus.
"Kevin Hart is actually really disrespectful toward anything and anyone that dose not walk and talk like he does. I've meet him , he's a racist jerc"
His momma did such a fantastic job raising him.
"5:00 Ok thats too far, threatening to fight a kid lmao"
"Pls tell me kevin is just being funny, no one can be scared of cute animals like that"
Im sure kevin is acting since hes a comedian
this might be the funniest video ive seen ever!! dyingggg
"I love animals and I consider myself a pacifist,  but I'll fight someone if they tried to give me a spider or put a spider on me."
Kevin Hart is a puss. No man value at all.
Hahaha he exactly like me scared of these animals. I will die before touching them.
I love spiders
4 years later: Jimmmy get it!
Jimmy! Jimmy get it! Jimmy get it! Jimmy!!
I have laughed my ass out over here
DOES ANYONE SEE JIMMY STAYING PUT  LOOKING AT THE SNAKE HE'S HOLDING IN HIS HANDS ??? HILARIOUS !!
Awesome.
This has to be staged I hope. Kevin Hart is a Hoot.
He really loves the animals and it shows in his enthusiasm..Just like his dad!!
That was hilarious I was laughing all alone out loud to dam funny.
kinda lost respect for poor kevin what the hell man
Whoa that bird legit sounds like the raptors in jurrassic movies
"I like @2:27 when Kevin Hart sees ""LeBron"" and brushes off like ""Fuck that. I'm outta here"""
"If Oprah doesn't like him,. Then that's enough for me to support him."
"Snake should have been called Kevin, not Lebron"
Man Robert looks so much like his dad
"So over Kevin Hart with animals. ""AHHHHH"""
"I seriously thought Kevin was okay with spiders I thought he was just scared of snakes, kangaroos ,dolphins and ostriches I thought he was okay with spiders I'm sorry I'm wrong.
Kevin has been around spiders.
I mean tarantulas I don't think he was afraid of tarantulas."
he don't have to be like that to be funny kevin
"Robert : they can easily kill a lion with those legs 

Kevin : pissing his pants already"
"I knew it was a goddamn spider the moment the aussie said small, fluffy and had beady eyes"
That bird sounds JUST like a freaking Dilophosaurus from Jurassic Park!  Tell me I'm wrong...
"The only good snake, is a dead snake"
I'll swing on ya... I'd kick the shit out of him...
the snake should have been named KD lmao
"i've never been a big fan of mainstream talkshows, but honestly at least with this video, seems genuine"
Good grief...Kevin what a girl
Man living up to his da's legacy. Good man yourself.
This is the best episode
He is screaming....
His assistant....ass is ...lol
Lebron
Lol....I love this man
Kevin yournuts...all one word
Obviously staged and fake shit
JIMMMMYYYYYYY LOL.
I sleep in the mountains out in the open with no fire and feed countless animals just a few feet away. anytime I wake up I hear animals close to me and have no problem sleeping. I thought I was having a muscle spasm in my leg but it was a raccoon tapping on me to wake me up
Jimmy looks like me introducing my friend to something new
The real question is: Which wild creatures is Kevin Hart NOT scared of?
"Kevin: ""You know what birds like?""
Robert: ""Uh-""
Kevin: ""Small objects.""

NAHHHH"
Kevin...showing his teeth and playing into stereotypes.   Again.
"Squire: Hmmm . . . *bobs head* eh, why not. I'm dipping Jimmy"
is that the dilophosoursus sound of jurassis park? i mean the ostrich
Who do I have to pay to stop this puke crime family from raping me... . ...
The funniest Jimmy Falon episode ever
"I wanna do it, they all look so adorable, I dunno if I could deal with the spider, but ither then that, that birb was so cutee, and the others were fine tooo"
When he said it had little eyes I knew it was a spider smh
I love about that video has the people Robert irwin that he plays Allie from Disney junior show bluey and Kevin hart
Robert: just trying to talk about animals. Kevin: ahh hell nah Jimmy: trying to convince Kevin to stay.
this is the best thing i've ever seen
Robert irwin is so good. I hope his dad can see this somewhere somewhen
Kevin pounding the the table trying to scare jimmy lmao
Kevin Hart is so annoying here.. I mean respect those animals!
Jimmy Falcon
"They should of had a monke , sugar glider and a red panda to comfort them QuQ"
Grown man on tv acting like a damn 3 year old.  Ruined what would have been an amazing show.  Let it be about the kid and animals instead of making it about him.  Kevin should have at least tried. Ass hole.
"jimmy and kevin are GREAT together! i am a weirdo i watch jimmy only when he has an animal person. i dont care about celebs at all. blah blah blah, but with robert irwin-now thats a show! add kevin hart the weenie and you have a GREAT show"
I wished they threw a fake snake at him
Kevin: JIMMMMY!!!!
That look like it jump. I lost it when Kevin said that.
Am I the only one who noticed the baby ostrich sounds just like the acid spitting dilo from Jurassic park
The idiots in the back raising their hands should the fined and permanently banned...
Steve would be proud of the man his son has become.
What a beautiful Falcon!!
It would have been even funnier if Jimmy tossed the tarantula at Kevin!
Why does Kevin Hart wear such small suits?
anyone notice how the audience wasnt very cooperative.. put ur damn hands down!
I love Kevin heart
Gibt es irgendein Tier von dem er keine Angst hat ? ^^
"i saw this on facebook and i laughed my ass off at kevin harts reaction and faces he makes,its so funny"
We need a redo of this please
"The spider thing is super scary...
I'm impressed he held it"
"You're wrecking the show kevin...stop TRYing
To be funny.  Can never be as funny as Johnny Carson used to be.
Anyway You're still funny"
"This is funny, but gosh these guys are scared of everything! I know me and most of my friends pay good money to do these sort of animal experiences, these guys dont realise how lucky they are!"
lol kevin is cringe here
0:55 9:57
Missing Steve Irwin
"Kevin is such a little bitch, and he's not even funny."
My favorite thing is just how Kevin looks incredulously at the camera whenever Robert delivers some sort of animal fact.
What a gobshit
If this guy brought all these animals to interact with I personally would have my whole day be made animals are the best all of them :DD
Now I see what the rock means lol
At 14:11 Kevin did the Michael Jackson lean BACKWARDS LOL
Very good. Congratulations
Funny Kevin
What a cowards.
Robert u r 101 % copy of ur father steve irwin.. felt v sad the day he died.. robert u r same energetic funny and animal lover as ur father.. stay blessed..
When Giselle showed up and someone mentioned an Ostrich I suddenly remembered that time Kevin Hart said a story about why he's afraid of Ostriches lmao
hahahahahaha!!!
I love these two
I wonder if he has ever been to the zoo at all cause I am lmao right now.
fuck yeah
Bro brought a monkey
"Kevin is a wuss & an idiot. He's ""supposed"" to be a grown man, & he's scared of totally cool great furry creatures & really cool birds. I've seen his gyrations before... Not impressed. Geez Louise, man up!"
Imagine DJ is here with kevin
Celebrities pretending to be scared of animals is the most tired shtick in the business. Nothing more irritating to watch.
I don't think this is funny.  It's actually kind of painful to watch these guys in terror in the presence of animals.  The only one I wouldn't want around me is the tarantula.  But these adult humans are so knotted up with fright that it shows they are completely uncomfortable with other living things and from the natural world.  Jimmy's body language and facial expressions are nervous energy at full volume.  And Kevin is incapable of even getting close.
"Nah when son pulled out the spider, i would have had to leave. Keep the money, i think i left the stove on."
"Just trust me,

Its not gonna happen jimmy"
"Kevin was like, oh hell no!"
"Kevin hart being scared of ostrich is normal, after all we had a war with them. For some reason we lost the battle with guns"
This guy Jimmy could have been the next Johnny Carson...but went politician.. ratings plummeted.
The Irwin legacy lives on
most black folks are scared of animals
It was funny in the beginning but then it gets annoying what a puss
"I'm 29 years old and Ostriches have been my favorite animal since 5th grade. Amazing. Panda bears come next, yall know they're herbivores? They don't eat meat. They don't attack anyone or anything except bamboo."
LoL
That first animal's noise is definitely the noise they used in Jurassic Park for that one dinosaur that kills Newman.
It's great that he kept his father's legacy alive!
0:56 Kevin remembering that one scene in Jumanji 2
Were they trying to make Kevin the butt of the joke? or was that accidentally on purpose
He is just like his father
Hate this. Wild animals do not belong in a tv studio. You won't see Attenborough doing that. Stupid people with no respect.
What a beautiful snake
11:09
Crikey!
Kevin is too much!
That was so funny and cool at the same time I love it
Jimmy held animals all the time at snl. He played skits as an animal enthusiast.. Jimmy is faking.
This video is funny as shit lol.
Just realized that the baby ostrich call is what they used for the Dilophosaurus in Jurassic Park when Dennis is in the rain.
Oh man... Kevin is a D!@K haha - hilarious
"My guess the fluffy thing is a tarantula
Edit called it"
I absolutely hate snakes I'd cry if someone tried to make me hold a dang snake..
That baby ostrich is 100% the sound of the Dilophosaurus (before it attacks) in Jurassic Park.
My jaws are hurting
"Kevin, anything with teeth can bite"
The funny thing is the Kevin isn't afraid at all of these animals. He's just acting!
8:36 Jimmy: I don't want to be stung like Peter Parker!
2:14 LeBron can strangle with his offense.
I love it that was the funniest thing I have ever seen in my life and I'm still laughing oh Lord help me
When chicken comes for the black guy.
When Kevin started yelling and banging on Jimmy's desk had me crying!!
Is it just me or the ostrich sounded like the Dilophisaurs from Jurassic Park?
I love elvis thats my fav kind of snake besides an anaconda I love Kingsgate
What a whimp
"Hey, did anyone check the kid got home on time"
"His body was facing this way, but his head, his head was facing this way! - Kevin Hart ""I'm Scared Of Ostriches"""
Really annoys me how loud the crowd is. No respect or consideration
If I was the small as a kid and I'd be terrified too
Dilophosaurus ostrich noises
I could have handled the snake and probably the falcon. Better keep that damn ostrich and spider away from me though lmao
The most funny I have seen this month. Awesome video.
What an exaggerated stereotype
This makes it hard to believe he posed with lions and swam with a shark
You can tell Kevin's been swooped up by a hawk many times in his past
Robert is going to be a legend just like his dad!!
Get Rupert Grint here please
I'll touch birds i'll touch snakes but i ain't touching no arachnid
"Kevin Hart is a great wit, comedian, and rightly cautious."
Should be renamed. Stupid
This kevin is too annoying for a grown up man behaving so weird.
That baby ostrich sounds like the dilophosaurus from Jurassic Park.
Hi
Meow
It's a raptor
Talking about peer pressure!
Why the hell did Fallon randomly start doing push-ups when they brought out the second snake lmao
"Kevin Hart has got to be the most overrated,  not so funny comedian that I have ever seen or heard.  He has been anointed by folks who love to see black people make fools of themselves"
I'd love to see Kevin jump and scream when he notices his shadow
is anyone not talking about how Kevin yelled Jimmy at 10:13 and 10:19
Kevin Hart is an attention seeker and certainly a drama queen!!!
Aww! I love he followed his parent's footsteps. His dad will be very proud.
I miss the segments that aren't politically driven and motivated by propaganda from the Left.
"Love Kevin, he is so funny"
Kevin is rediculous.
"Didn't think anyone was more a wuss than jimmy, then there's kevin..."
"I come back to this clip over, and over, and over again whenever I need a laugh...  God love ya Kevin, this is the bestest!  <3"
I love Kevin Hart!!  That was so funny..
Sheesh he looks like his dad!
Love to see him with an Australian  bird eating  spider
More scripted crap from Jimmy
That's so cool!
"8:46
Robert: She's so cute!
Kevin: STAY TF AWAY FROM ME
Jimmy: *turns into spider man*"
"I am scare also as hell but if that kid woudl tell me be ok, calm, tells me what to do.....im so happy to try the animals.  Just not big ones like crocodile or hippo or weird shit. I trust that boy......or cobra and poison, or small insects that can go down your ear and fuck you up in your head..........Love see animals on tv!!"
Does that smell like Kevin Hart s*** or Jimmy s***
Do you all smell that I think Jimmy s*** himself that's why Kevin Hart's staying away from me staying away from him I can smell that all way into Florida you know he s*** himself
"No what is wrong with American liberals?, they live in fear which is why they vote Democrat."
Hilarious!!!!!
Simba's and kfc Al bhaik Al bhaik
The poor lads trying to do professional presentation and these piss  week yanks are just making it into a comedy skit
I never Kevin heart was such a bitch
Awsome
jumangi
"All I hear is Dennis about to be splattered with poison and ate, with the baby ostrich. Whole epidemic is twogrown men squirming about on a stage."
He should be scared of me.
I am with Kevin!
Kevin: Jimmyeaaahhhhh!!!
"This boy remind me of steve irwin, a lot."
Kevin just got on my nerves by the end.
"I noticed when Kevin was out on the floor, that even his shadow was pissing itself ! 
Cowboy Up !"
Kevin Hart is afraid of animals but knows how to attack gay people
0:29 Jurassic fans know this sound
"HE SAID CUTE AND CUDDLY TO A FUCKING TARANTULA?!?! Bro if I was Kevin and actually said yes, and opened my eyes to a tarantula, I would pass out and never trust another human again."
#SaveShwetabhGangwar
Robert looks so much like his father
Kevin really is so annoying! He went way overboard. Overdramatized every single animal. Never have him on the show with awesome Robert or Dave Salmoni again! He totally took away from the show.
"Robert Irwin is the kindest man !!!!!
Makes his dad proud!!!"
comedians could literally breathe and people would start laughing
Kevin makes for good TV.
Kevin is hilarious
He managed the humans very well! Good job Rob!
This is his audition for Jumanji
