Awwsome. I won my Gameboy by selling the most candy bars during a fundraiser when I was a kid!
I remember my Mom bought me a Gameboy advance and Gameboy SP :D Super Mario is the best the the WWE ahahah
I still have my  purple gameboy color! I wonder what he would think about the newer game boy
"I SEVERLY miss the arcade at the malls..mortal kombat,tekkin,street fighter! Mannnnn"
"I bought it when I saw that Nintendo created ""Golf"" for the unit.  I played it for hours."
"So, so much want. Even seeing the original boxes now sends chills. I was 7! Coolest thing a kid could own."
Thanks Marques for this upload. Gameboy is THE beginning of gaming. You can't debate this.
Just sad that its name will not be Game Girl. Think about what the world will look like now if it is a Game Girl :D
Can we maybe bring back retro tech Mr Brownley Plz sir
"I'm so sad how your gb print came out! If it had fresh and high quality thermal paper, it could create really nice dithering effects and got pretty close to looking like the screen. The old paper has all expired and most paper available today comes cut from the same material used for receipt printers. it just doesn't react the same :("
1989
lol just realized my old roommate is in this video
I started out watching ur reviews on iPads snd now 6 hours later im watching every retro tech. bro I hope u get well compensated. I've never seen work compiled like this in a long time on YouTube. ur just amazing Marquez!!!
"Amazing! I remember buying one in 1989 in the US and selling it in 1991 in Spain for a higher price, since it had not comed out yet there! so had lots of fun with it and once I managed all the games... was able to get more than I bought it for! so great memories about this device, so exited as a kid when I got it "
"Everyday I feel more and more lucky to have been born in the 80s, and experience such incredible advancements in the technological world."

One day the DS will be seen as retro in the days of the switch age. That will be a nostalgic time
Does Skyrim run on this yet?
This channel is just another example of our societal decline. You will answer to the Lord Jesus Christ on judgment day for how you lived your life.
"This made me weirdly emotional, all that childhood nostalgia... I was with the GBA gen but my brothers grew up the 80s and I got their old GB and GBCs - good times
Also 'dope or nope' cracked me up. Especially the fish attachment - like, what? That was a thing?! Crazy XD"
Last
"Damn, 4 years? I remembered when this episode first dropped. We need more retro tech Marques!"
Boko chico texas?
"It wasn't boring as a kid in the 80s! 
There wasn't what we have now, but we had more natural stuff to do!"
I actually never like tetris. nor race games (except mario kart ofcourse). jumping games was the jazz for me
"Kids these days have it way worse: the brain is not evolved to be enjoying things constantly. It makes it malfunction. period. it sounds good. It's not good. You're way better off with a bit of boredom and a healthy brain. Besides, you're only bored when you fail to entertain yourself."
gameboy: my first addiction :p
2023
3:27 AYO WHERE MY FELLOW GAMEBOY SUCKERS AT???
I grew up on the game boy and my siblings still play it to this day
"i owned a handy boy and i hated the themb stick add on, used to leave it off."
Bhai ye gali 8 me happy ko jante ho
Grown ass men acting like the Gameboy is some alien or ancient tech and unironically judge it by todays standards.
Oh my God is good*
"I avoided this for nearly four years, not even halfway through and I will never finish or watch this again"
"Hey Marques! I love your videos!At first, I was like why did this get so many views but then, I watched the video. Pure magic. Amazing!"
"This video was kinda lame and lacked efforts to understand the hype. You guys failed to figure out why Gameboy is so excellent. simply torching, djing and some useless gadgets don't cut it. You missed its compatibility with Gameboy color games, it's adaptor card for the snes, it's actual properties making it so reliable or their design choices, why they used this button layout in the first place. They put a shitton of elbow grease on this handheld and you guys failed to see what it made so special, no comparison to the current trend of mobile games and no processing thoughts on it. You gave just obvious facts that everyone could know if they googled It for some minutes."
"The  video title brought me here, M.B. kept me here"
Turkey needs help !if u can help them maybe with fund raising or whatever you find best .if in your next 3 videos u will ask people to donate for turkey that will be very  helpful for them . Lord of heavens will reward you for doing the best u could... Who so ever is reading this comment plz help turkey
"In the 80's, life was not boring. Playing outside was fun. Climbing trees, hiking, running around the block, hide and seek, making paper planes, bubbles, red light green light 1 2 3, exercising... These are just some of the activities children at that time experienced which resulted in creativity and learning through socialisation which taught life lessons and how to interact and appreciate others. Technology added and improved upon this in some regard but there were also some drawbacks as with most things in life. This series is a great idea and this video is great. Keep it up!"

Good gamee
That ad that said something about when it comes to space games there's nothing that compares to Atari and the other guy comes in and says have you heard of intelevision my dad had that when he was a kid
I hope that I someday get to play on a Game Boy.
I remember being a kid and riding my bike everywhere b4 sega and turbo graphix 16.
"With all these new gadgets and gizmos that Marques reviews, I'm proud that the old Gameboy is the most viewed video."
Wow nostalgia hits
Who is casey neistat
"where can I get ONE, remember you buying MB"
"I grew up with Gameboy Advance SP and Sony PSP, before getting TV Consoles."

Le Game Boy *
Memories!!
My childhood
Please do the ipods. And I lean from the first generation to the one right before the first ever iphone. Seems like a good progression from the Gameboy
"Suicide panniru,enkitta vachukatha,"
that's a really cool concept
It was more painful to watch him torch the gameboy than it was to be a kid.
I didnt know anybody with a broken gameboy lol
I played Tetris untill I broke a button.  I had the light to ply at night.
"game boy is a plastic tank. i bet if you cracked a piece of the plastic off, you could kill someone with it."
"10k years ago... ROFL alien.. ROFL avane ammede pootile alien.. ROFL

I broke my first Gameboy by headbutting it...
"I have never used a Gameboy, I missed it, don't no why really, I've been playing video games since Atari 2600, and I'm 49!"
my best christmas as a kid was when I got a gameboy colour!
fuck im old now
I used to smell the battery of my Samsung and of phones with a backside you could remove
ok
Dislikes LIVE:16K
You would still have the iPhone because apple was a company before the game boy was invented
"It's weird seeing something from my childhood (I'm 34 now) being described as ""retro"". I even had the gameboy printer though I never did buy any new paper after I went through the first roll. Thing just sat in my closet for 15 years. I even have a GBC emulator on my phone for god sake."
Next test: Game Boy vs B83 Hydrogen Bomb

"Jesus Christ Saves

Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is returning very soon, and is the reason for all of the things that are happening on the Earth right now. This planet is on borrowed time.

Jesus Christ died on a cross, was buried in a tomb, and rose from the dead 3 days later, to pay for the sins of mankind, to give us eternal life and forgiveness from God.

EXACTLY how to be Saved by Jesus Christ, the Son of God:

1. Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord.

2. Believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus Christ from the dead.

Biblical References:
1. Romans 5:9
2. Romans 3:23
3. Romans 6:23
4. Romans 10:9
5. Romans 10:13
6. Ephesians 2: 8 & 9
7. John 3:16

God bless you, peace be with you always. Thank you for your time."

It really is indestructible. You have no idea how many times I threw mine in frustration and it still work. It was still working just a few years ago before I lost it.
You should do one about the N64.
You could ALSO make music on the GameBoy Camera!
watching in 2022
i feel like that game boy surface is made from motorcycle helmet
"What do you mean ""Game & Watch"" wasn't any good? My only Nintendo device I had was G&W Donkey Kong and I played the hell out of it. I could never get my parents to buy a NES and by the time the Gameboy came out I was in high school."
Marques Brownlee your video was a lot of things I will mention one super fantastic this was truly a joy to watch thank you for making this video.
Sounds hell of a lot like Apple nowadays ... And i like it
Buen trabajo
Hariompowar
So how did you source that unit?
"Can't take them serious, seems so scripted"
"Very interesting video!  One best thing was the game boy camera and printer. The printer was so good at that time,  and the printer paper you can peel the back and stick it anywhere.  That printer you have must be out of ink or something because back then was awesome"

Your shit sucks bro.
How has this video got so many views years later it still is the most viewed MKBHD video
"I was born in 1989. My parents bought me a Game Boy that year. My dad was into games with the likes of Atari and NES, so he wanted to get me into video games asap. So I was pretty much born with a Game Boy in my hands. While growing up, we had like 3 of the old grey DMG Game Boys in the house. I also got a Game Boy Color when the Pokemon Gold themed console came out. Eventually got the original GBA also, and then a GBA SP. So yeah, I grew up with Game Boy (though I DID also have a Game Gear just for the hell of it). I still have all of them, and a good chunk of games for 'em.

Nowadays, I still use my GBA SP on occasion with the help of a flash cart (it's just way more convenient). I also recently bought an emulation handheld and have been playing Game Boy on it too (I bought the one that was colored like the old grey Game Boy, of course).

So needless to say, the Game Boy has been a huge part of my life pretty much since I was born. I'm sitting here playing Pokemon Pinball while watching this video, actually.

I remember going to the store and having to pick out games based entirely on if the Box made it look cool or not, or if I was lucky, my recent issue of Nintendo Power had some Game Boy games in it that made me want something specific. We didn't have internet to look up reviews at the time. Man, I miss Nintendo Power. Something about flipping through the pages, looking at all the new games coming out. I also loved the little fanart section in the back."

"All videogames and pornography are garbage that can damage our brains and souls to a point of no going back. Follow God from now on, ask for Divine Grace, pray and if you have any temptation, just run away to make sure you don't sin. Believe me, all about Jesus in the Gospels is true and this life is just like a shadow. Pray The Lord of The Divine Grace at 3 p.m and follow The Sacred Heart of Jesus. Our Beloved Lord has many powerful promises to the ones who follow these devotions. Don't be afraid and trust Him because nothing will last forever in these world and Judgment Day is near. I beg all the people who read this to take this seriously and let be loved by Jesus and Mary."

"Great video, a reintro of the retro! One thing to add, we had a guy in the neighborhood who had a gameboy, WE all shared and played. Thanks Gameboy"
nice flag on that sweater
I had a Gameboy in the 90's and I loved it! But Tetris sucked! Like with all Nintendo systems at the time they should have packaged a Mario brothers game with it.
"""I wasn't around back then"" etc etc. Thanks for letting us know."
I like the evil mega-tokyo company Nintendo . What do they want me to do for them because they are so interested in the little child prodigy of the ww2 era of a war company and are they wanted to be a girl naked gameplay expert with her big ones out in the barefoot now in the present era of the game worlds.........
Waste boy you can keep your jame
"Do a Video on Drones 
From ""Parrot"" to ""Dji"""
Great Video
When i hear Gameboy I think Pokemon.
"Oh shoot!!  Sharing blindfolds!  Marquess started Covid~19!!

Just kidding.  Love your channel!"
I ha e never imagined Marques whith a flamethrower
please do more old consoles!so good!
There's a great chance that this video got copyright striked by Nintendo
"Love how this video covers a bunch of major categories of the Gameboy's influence.  It meant it was a little light on the actual _gaming_ content of the platform, but I think as a general overview it's fantastic.  Also I died a little inside when the Gameboy was flamethrower'ed, even though it survived."
"8:30 it's so stupid to do this... 
Like that if the product had been designed to resist flames."
Found my Gameboy lighted magnifier a few days ago. O the memories.
Really no mention of the Fairchild Channel F which came before the Atari. Created and invented by Jerry Lawson. That is messed up
Jai shree ram
Sweet spyderco
Tetris is still the greatest video game of all time!

Cool video!
Wow one of My favourite consoles get Is anniversary
"Wer  repariert  defekte  Gameboys  auf  den Philippinen  ?
Die  NINTENDO - ZENTRALE  kann  mir  nicht  weiterhelfen"
"""Remember when you sucked on your Gameboy?""

No but I sucked on my N64 controller though. I think that should have been an early indicator of sorts....."
"Gameboy: *literally survived a Gulf War bombing*
nokia: pathetic"
almost shat my pants seeing you REALLY POP THIS SEAL man :D i grew up with that thing and still own it with some of the best games ever made for it. Thanks for that episode
Epic! i would love to see the Nintendo NES
"Literally to the 1% who's reading this, God bless you, and may your dreams come true, stay safe and have a wonderful day,"
"Bringing back memories of my Game Boy, loved the soundtrack!"
"wow, why did you have to destroy a piece of old retro hw? that was so unnecessary. celebrating the gameboy my a**. if you make a shallow and cringey interview for youtube (oh look everybody, it's an old timey thingy, i won't bother to learn how to use), cause they give you money, fine. we all have to live and pay the rent. just don't be a jerk about it and destroy mint condtition gameboys."
Proud owner of ALL gameboy models!!
They had some really good football games I borrowed one from a friend my kids now have it lol
Playing Tetris on level 9 & speed 5 was for champions only
Interesting
God I cringed when he cut the seals lol
I loved my Gameboy! Tetris!
Omg I never though I'd be considered  retro at 34 smh.
Ads are so irritating and annoying
I love watching this
"I randomly found this video
But I can strieght up say, I hate you for making me feel old
I played and owned the first Gameboy and you sir don't even know that the Gameboy had a case that looks like a gameboy
Kids these days has it SO damn easy"
"We have the same last name. But it's Scottish in origin? Wondering how that works, unless you were adopted or are mixed race?  Love the retro gameboy, had one too , and miss it.  I still have a gameboy advance and gameboy 3ds that I never use , plus some games. But the original is childhood (lies lol, late teens)   memories."
Them old games on sega and nes compare ps2 even brain damage but takes you back.But at the time we loved it
"Marques its such an Idiot wtf haha 
""Im guessing the 1970s"" after He Just told him that they did playing cards before Video Games and as If they totally could Switch their entire productionline in that short Period. Small Brian time"
"Ah man, this was so nostalgic to watch. I remember playing on the Gameboy until dark, sitting on the steps outside with friends, struggling to see the game as the sun set."
"Video games are for little kids.  Get outside and learn how to do some real actual work. That is what a man does. Get out in the hot sun do some yard work do some landscaping some construction labor.  I did all that growing up.  No video games at all.  This stuff did not ""change our lives forever"". It does not mean jack shit.  You should be so embarrassed and  ashamed to sit on your as all day and play video games and do nothing.  ""Cultural impact"".  Can ""men"" get any weaker than this? Life for a kid was way better than. We played outside, worked outside,  rode bikes, got tan and tough!    If it is so good now why are you all  so depressed,  screwed up,  a victim, and dont know if you are a boy or girl?  So sad to be you!"
I'd rather not. Grace does not reciprocate
"so basically he has no knowledge, skills, or talents so started a Youtube channel featuring things that already existed. :("
This dude has the personality of a dead fish. Wow. What a dud. Why do people watch him?
it is hard to explain the love for the gameboy.. as a kid growing up to the gameboy i poured hours in to the thing and it is hard to explain the experience with the device growing up.. hearing the start up sound again just felt so nostalgic.. i remeber the days of waking up playing the gameboy and just messing out with what i can.. it is just a wild run..
"Love the idiot at about 6:05 saying the Game and Watch ""actually wasnt any good..."" 

No it just sold 43.4 million units cuz it was trash."
"This was good. Yet still even if Tetris started it. POKEMON WAS WAY HUGER OF A MOVEMENT > than tetris was. So weird this didn't feature Pokemon. Pokemon is what most people think of when they think of the gameboy experience, not tetris. So ye I'd say the late 90's had a bigger gameboy movement than the years before that."
"Gameboy! Tetris and Nemises were my first games

I also had the 'purple' protection case!"
Terribleee editing terribllee shooting terribblee lights
This is dope!
You are a bad decision
"I flipped out- WHY WOULD YOU OPEN A MINT BOX

eBay has that listed for $40,000!!!!"
Its strange to know that he wasn't alive when this was the current handheld console. Becasue I grew up with it.
Nintendo was and still is a yakuza Clan/Family.
Damn the Printer was sick! With that Receipt-Paper... When printing Pokemon on Receipt-Paper was the hottest shit!
my favorite console as a kid..
In the 3 year life span of being a retro gamer I love seeing the gameboy from the eyes of a non retro gamer
"It is time to get right with Jesus. nobody is automatically gonna go to heaven at the end of it, we all have lied or stolen or had sex before marriage and the punishment is hell. Jesus died so you can get a clean slate and forgiveness of a future sin when we confess and forsake it. When you start to follow him you have to strive to obey what he commands. Read the Bible!!
No one will enter heaven without the blood of Jesus. No other way but through Jesus.!.!"
"To anybody down here in the comments: Remember the name Gunpei Yokoi.  He's an often overlooked figure in the world of video gaming.  Yokoi fostered the talent of Miyamoto, invented the D-pad and the Gameboy.  He tragically died before his time.  Rest in Peace Mr. Yokoi, your legacy has lived on."
"My gameboy clear's weakpoint was the on-off switch.
It became detached from the electronics making the device non-functional. Lasted a few years before that though."
POV: this was just recommended to you.
"6 year old me had no problem opening the games lol, the new generation has gotten soft"
"That chiptune part was dope as hell. I remember playing these old things, but I really got my start with the Game Boy Advanced SP. This felt retro to me at the time too."
Muy bonito pero siguiera jugando con el mobil.
"Ooo Myyy Godddd!!! Oil Panic! Memories, I tell you. Memories."

"Man I honestly feel blessed to have lived through this tech world , I had the original Gameboy and Nintendo , my cousin had an Atari .. my first cellphone was in 1997 , and it was a brick !"
This is a YouTube commercial. Turned it off when Casey arrived
They are misleading us with the fucking games that they have no purpose to play is this a game boy
fun fact Bergsala AB from Sweden was the biggest seller of Nintendo in the world (per capita) with the game & watch. Bergsala sold more nintendos in a month almost than the US in a year (almost). Swedens population at the time was about 8 million.
How the hell did you source a Game Boy mint-in-box? How much did this cost you?
Mark-ass brownlee!?!
"Welp, I feel old now."
I have a game boy in my coat pocket that I wear at school and I play it at break
Gameboy vs the world. I had a color and advance. Best handheld game console for a kid
WHO IN THEIR MIND WOULD CALL THEIR COMPANY STD???
All this mention of the iPhone but none of the console's successors?
Watching someone try to open a Game Boy cartridge case for the first time in 2022 is priceless
DISLIKE MY VIDEO RN
xDD
"No mention of Pokemon? 
Legit the most successful media franchise in Human history got it's humble start on the gameboy"
Life for a child in the 80s was fun
You should review the sega game gear that thing was so awesome along with the OG game boy ahh good times wish I could go back in time to the good old days this is why the Nintendo switch is so bestie they took a handheld and home console and fused it together to make a epic system
"Super Mario land, contra, double dragon, Pokemon and donkey kong were mega hits"
"In 1990 my brother was in the US Army and sent to Saudi Arabia in the 1990 run up to Desert Storm. Months and months stuck in the desert waiting for a war to start. I sent him a GameBoy, tons of batteries and a bunch of games. He loved it. Both he and the GameBoy got home safe."
This guy does a documentary about a Gameboy and never played one wtf!
I remember those days when I played with one
It's weird to call something retro that's from your own youth.
We would still have smartphones if GameBoy had never been invented.
Loved the video!!!
"second time watching this video...and the nostalgia REALLY hits!

also, how do you have an unopned box of gameboy? thats INSANE"
Winny the poh

"I hope Marques at least played the Advance, like c'mon dude never had a Game Boy at all?!!"
YouTube subliminals
Video starts at 3:32
"what is up with that  weird big nose guy in the glasses hes so not cool, why is he even  half ass famous?/!! lol"
We were stronger back in the day. We had no problem opening that cartridge case
"the ink in that printer was probably too old. The print out quality was much better than that. I still have my camera, printer and everything else. my kids laugh at me when they see my gameboy collection."
Beautiful
Perfection
Black pray.......red blood........black woman aviator sunglasses military......
"It wasn't painful to be a kid back then, it was so much fun. Those childhood adventures will be with me forever."
"Hey gang. If you dig this sort of thing, check me out! All sorts of old tech."
10:18 that reaction :D
Fuck the guy who said the Game & Watch was not actually any good. Moron has no idea what hes talking about. Millions of units sold...
I love that this dude just unboxed a thirty plus year old gameboy and is now walking all over NYC with it like it is whatever.
"Marques, you are so physically weak if you can't open a Gameboy game case.  Hit the gym for more than cardio, guy."
"The oldest piece of tech you've ever held is from 89? Smh, clearly never had any of the random LCD handhelds released in the early 80s."
"The smiles after ""GAME BOY""."
The Music from both Super Mario Land and Super Mario Land 2 will be forever etched into my memory...
I work in a gas station booth and my GBA is always with me
There are a lot of childhood memories there
I need to advertise with you youtube. Please leave your telegram way. I will pay you2
It slaps.
Amazing
"I had the flip gameboy advance , then a PSP , and a PS4"
"The Gameboy was a bit low-tech even at the time, with b&w screen and 8 bit. The Atari Lynx was color, 16 bit but went through batteries very quickly (they were non rechargable and expensive). No doubt Gameboy had the better games too!"
"I am crying.
He destroyed a gameboy..."
"My father owned the original Gameboy, and we still have it to this day. It's a family treasure.

I grew up with Nintendo consoles such as the gameboy color, then the Gameboy advanced followed by the NDS, 3DS and finally the Switch. I never got the Wii or WiiU."
Wtf is Matt Bellamy doing here lmao
Game & Watch
The Gameboy was a beast.
Already showing support for Ukraine I see 3:14
Why is youtube suggesting the game boy retro on my feed after just thinking about it last night. Crazyyyy
Nice bro
Why TF did he lick the gameboy
"its like watching Netflix, This is so good video"
Sega game gear
"I love the gameboy, I still own mine, it's so cool."
"Marques Brownlee: the Game Boy is the most popular handheld ever!
Nintendo DS: am I a joke to you?"
"wooaa - 25 years later I find the original call of code trigger for me, on a ""random"" YT video."
"I remember back in 2011 I was at a doctors appointment, I went to the bathroom and I found a Gameboy advanced in one the stalls. Obviously now I know what it was, but back then I was only around 9, and I thought it was the coolest thing ever."
The Game Boy sucked compared to the Sega Game Gear.
All this tech and the most watched video on this channel (by a margin of 50%) is still a 1989 Gameboy smh
OMG I love this series!
"Handy boy by STD
Best part!"
i wanna clarify...the printer...back when it was new was a deffiente dope...because it actually fully printed and was recognizable.i think in this case we have to consider the period and the product before saying its a nope.
@Marques did you have one of the other variations of the game boy (color/advance/advance SP)
Did anyone catch toby ???
Engagement engagement engagement
Best GameBoy game was Super Mario Land
"I'm a 90s baby. But yes older tech was more durable cuz thats what they aimed for. Now like Apple, everything is fragile just so that they can make more money once u need a fix or update... smFh"
this reminds me of my game boy
"I'm a boy, but how come female versions of the game boy didn't exist?"
Who else use to see this all the time and still kinda does?
"nintendo is famous maker of flower card game Hanafuda.Hanafuda is vividly colored,popular among japanese gambler."
How do I get this fucking video off my feed. Never been interested..
"Ah, memories... I remember loving the Gameboy so much despite its limited screen tech. Always carried 4 extra AAA batteries in my lunch box just in case I ran out of juice. My favorite games were; super Mario land, judge dredd and gargoyles quest."
Whole childhood in a palm of hand. Helped me through so many things in life as a kid
Zzzzzzz
He just burned through hundreds thousands of dollar worth of vintage Sealed Gameboy stuff.
Gotta love  childhood games!! LOVE THE GAMEBOY. I thank Nintendo
"Vim por um amigo que indicou, realmente muito bom o canal"

a.k.a the most iconic youtube video
"The game boy used to be 90 dollars, equivalent to 200 dollars now!"
"One of my oldest memories is from when my dad picked me up from school and told me to reach under my seat and there she was, a light blue Gameboy Advanced SP. To this day my greatest treasure. Nintendo created a masterpiece series with all of its gameboy models."
He leave at South Africa?
Nice
I have not seen Dan Ackerman since the days of Play Value what a trip

"Life of a child in the 80's was terrible.
Me: Beg to differ"
BOUNCE  MY BEAUTIES AND WIGGLE MY MAGIC BUNNY
"Sees the flamethrower come out. As an old person, I just want to say, ""Fuck you Marques!"""
"Hmm. I loved the Gameboy and watching this brought back some fond memories but I think attributing the presence of all of todays handheld gaming to the Gameboy is a bit of a stretch. Handheld gaming was destined to happen one way or another, it's just that Nintendo were the first to do it successfully. So yeah, not sure if I really believe the final sentiment."
10:18 lol such nerds love it
Wow
"My boyfriend realised he *had* to date me the day he found out I still have a Gameboy, Gameboy colour, Gameboy advanced, and Gameboy SP, to name a few"
"something that came out when i was a teen is now retro. thanks for making me feel old. :P 
nintento game and watch next then! :P"
God I hope he realized how rare and valuable that Gameboy Printer and Paper actually is like holy fuck
Legends are watching after YouTube recomendation
"Honestly these things could make a comeback if they sold them on store shelves, kinda like record players are currently. I know if I saw one at Target, I would buy it immediately."
"Sheesh when i heard the word ""game n watch"" said, i just had so many flashbacks to my childhood.
Haven't heard ""game n watch"" in years"
Nieegga get out off youtube
POV: This came in ur recommendations 2 years later
I didn't came from most viewed video. I came here by YouTube recommendation
Music creation part was next level
That's awful what the hell. Why would they destroy a mint condition Gameboy like that? That thing belongs in a museum.
"Wow! Brings back so many memories !!
Great show and exploration of how we got to where we are now. 10/10 to Marques."
"I got game boy and the advance game boy with the carry case and magnifying clip on for the top ,Pokemon games 1,2, Tetris about twelve games in plastic case.I have it to my son for Christmas last year.also got Atari with tapes lol."
16:44 meet Peter Parker everybody.
I played a lot of game boy and game boy advance and game boy the flip one back in the day
FIFA on Gameboy was so fun. Every team had a unique finishing move type strike. Tetris was always the one though. I put more hours in on that cartridge than any other game in my life to be honest.
Still have all these Games and consoles
"I remember being in 4th grade,(mid 90's)
(a straight-A student... bored out of my mind) during class, I was playing my game boy with the sound turned off, while holding it inside of my desk.
I think I was playing either super mario bros, or tetris, then I looked up... and my teacher was standing in front of my desk, with his hand out. Needless to say, I had to get my game boy back from the principal with my parents. But yeah... memories."
The indestructible Game Boy.
"*YOU can`t fight the GameBoy with Fire, because the GameBoy is Fire!*"
No
"People: *call Gameboy retro
Me: WHY MUST YOU HURT ME IN THIS WAY"
Been able to play with others by connecting the GBs with the cable was an experience of its own. Pokemon was the prime example. I have so many memories of me playing with my friends during recess or at the park. It was a cool piece of gaming which let you connect with others.
"Dude, the printer was legit. Not sure what happened with that one but back in the day it printed out pictures just like seen on the Game Boy. It was the perfect partner to the camera."
Hey! That's Tobey Maguire 16:43
you are amazing YouTuber
our family is so retro that i'm 13 and have used a game boy earlier this week
"Strongly disagree with the sentiment we had it worse than the kids now. We had the best if you ask me. Games were developed with quality and fun in mind, while we still played outside mostly. A great combination of just playing around outside and having an hour or so per day on a console. Different than 24/7 online presence we have nowadays with games being developed as a result of studies focussed on what's the most addictive."
also the gameboy printers's paper is just too old and needs new ones
the ds sold 154 million and the gameboy sold roughly 108-109 so the ds wins
Man this takes me back. Thanks for the video
The game boy saved me when we went on a road from Missouri to Florida.
Game boy is retro now
That's one Dislike for treating a Gameboy with disrespect....
Yokoi Gunpei !!
Mai hindi me likhunha taaki ye gadhe log hame samajh na paaye
your gameboy printer had been dropped one too many times. that is why it printed like that.
This was my childhood!  Tread lightly Sir!!!
"I remember getting a Game Boy for my birthday, all those decades ago.  I had a lot of good time with a lot of good games, but it wasn't too long before my mom started playing, and eventually it became hers more than mine.  She still plays Dr. Mario now and then."
"Love the game boy, still have a game boy color."
This thing was such a piece of shit that I rather played outside.
Marques Brownlee III will do one of these for the Nintendo Switch in the year 2067.
bazinga!
The good old times <3
"I'm using the translator sorry for any error, there was no mention of other models and possibly the best selling game of game boy: pokemon"
"Nobody: ...
Nothing: ...
Not a single soul: ...
13:23,The company: Let's name our brand STD"
DOPE!!
bruh why put a gameboy on fire. its so useless
I love these I bought two one original grey and a yellow for playing somewhere else so if I break or damage the other the original is still good.
This guy never played Sega Genesis. Never played the Gameboy. His childhood was a fucking mess.
"Oh I never knew Casey Neistat created YouTube... I thought it was Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim... but umm okay."

The best
"Remember when you'd suck on your gameboy?

Or is that just me..."
That was a 1000$ gameboy in the sealed box
Abolish the police

"I still have mine, and it works same as the first day."

"I bought my first one brand new for a whopping 49 dollars plus tax in 1991. It came with Tetris.
Edit: My favorite game of all time on that thing was Metroid 2 Return of Samus."
Only those of us who were teens in the 80's can truly explain how and what the 80's were like. Millennials have no clue!!!
Gameboy color was the shit
"201 lines on tetris starting on lvl10.
Got 2player lead always beet my bro 4libws 4lines.  Nightlight too"
"I miss my childhood so much, gameboy was my best present ever, along with some big lego technic kits."
Like she says: Memories
Please do the Nokia phones.
"2019: Why would I ever need a gameboy?????
2020: GIMMMMMEEEE NOWWWWWWWWW"
"In 6th grade, my gameboy color was robbed from me by 3 bigger kids."
Kinda weird to here folks never played a game boy just showing my age lol
"Got the gameboy when it came out that first year for Xmas my GMA copped it for me ,it was awesome af! Had quite a few games that first year like gargoyles quest but I just walked in circles for the most part never could figure out wtf I had to do probably would still be the same today anyhow tetris was definitely the most played game of the entire lifetime of the gb that I had. Got the lightboy accessory and it was broken sucked some major booty big time!"
Brings back so many memories. Thanks for making this masterpiece!
"I had a yellow brick Gameboy back in the day and I lost it, pretty sad.

Also Chiptune I my favorite"
New video will come on my channel
12:30 - That is me and my neighbor Julie!  That was a long time ago!
"I keep my first GameBoy Color (the translucent purple one) and a copy of Pokemon Red in my everyday backpack at all times, just in case."
"Only just found you on YouTube  Marques, and glad I did as you put out seriously dope content!!"
"Everyone that is old enough to remember the handheld electronic games when they came out back during the mid to late 70's,early 80's.One's that i have are the basketball game ""Slam Dunk"" and the Electronic baseball. You could carry them with you anywhere. I was in elementary school during those times and my teacher at that time would let us bring our games to class on a rainy day and that was our recess break."
Jeffree Epstein didn't do it
04:21 This guy looks so much like Jesse in the ATHLEANX channel
Damn so the gameboy fucked up the whole world...
My dad bought me one from a pawn shop with Mario and the six coins.
"What.... THE.... f$$ck.  Where any of these, ""Gen whatever the f's"", that you interviewed even alive when the gameboy came out. Like someone who actually expierienced what it felt to use that tech when it actually came out. Your last statement of ""Now I get it"".  Your not even close to getting it. As I listened to you and all of your interviewees, you all come across as a bunch of Jaded Tech Snobs."
"Endless hours of Pokemon, various sports games, Warlocked...ohh the good times"
"In Solvet Russia, Tetris plays you."
positive game begin
oh my childhood memories. if you have this in school you are considered rich. it was like having an iphone that time
I'm angered that he got an unopened gameboy and tortured it. That's one less new authentic gameboy in the world. I get it's his money but still....
Now he make me want to buy one. It brings back good memories of my childhood
I wish Nintendo would join the future
"When that Gameboy ping went off in the first few seconds, I completely involuntarily smiled"
"dont like this video, from 3:35 to 3:38 you used footages without permission, so remove the video asap"
16:44 is that our Spider-Man Tobey Maguire?
you are mad
great video. And how can I also find a brand new GameBoy in its box?
Gameboy made in Nippon. We expect nothing less.
I still had fun as a 90s kid. I just played outside with my friends instead of being the phone or w/e all day
"NES, SNES, Game Boy, changed everything."
Hahaha this is so funny and so sad at the same time.
Everything was great until they started burning Gameboys
What about a retro tech episode on the Commodore Amiga 500. That would be sweet.. that thing really impressed me as a kid in the 80s
"Nintendo Game & Watch was AWESOME, it was a huge hit in the playgrounds of the 1980s in the UK. Plus the G&W systems invented the D-Pad and the DS clamshell format."
".,."
9:51 that's what she said
You barely scratched the surface with the games. Why didn't you demonstrate some gameplay?
"God damn how do people watch this guy, no offence but he is so boring lol"
Very stupid gimmick
Can someone for the love of fuck me sideways tell me how to get rid of this video on my front page? thank you. This is the only video where that NOT INTERRESTED thing doesn't work and i also already watched this video wich was very hard for me cause of you know Casey Fuck-face  and now it keeps returning! bye everybody
Thanks for your honest reviews
2 years later and this video is still on my recommended page every day. How much you have to pay for this kind of advertisement?
"very quality retrospective video, good job guys!!"
"My favorite Christmas present ever was a gameboy color I got in 2000, I still carry a GBA around with me to this day"
80s memories
"nobody said ""oh maybe i am a gamer"" in the 90s it wasn't even a word..."
i got the grey one and super mario my sister got a red one and loony tunes good times
The combined testosterone of all the males speaking is pretty on par with the plus sized black lady
Hello product. Tell me about retro product.
"Retro tech 2049: this season we will be reviewing the PS4, the FitBit, iPhone 7, and 5g."
watching this again after two years...
"Man, that was hot"
I'm here because I want it to stop being recommended. I don't want to see this.
Did he just open a factory sealed gameboy?
So good! Thank you Marques!
"Literally never had a problem opening the game cases before. Even when I got my Gameboy at age 10 in 1989. We will excuse you being so young. Unlike what the person in your video said, the 80s were far from boring, it was way way way more fun than these days."
Destroying the Gameboy really hurt.
Opening something as valuable as a sealed Gameboy and then immediately shooting a flamethrower at it is big MKBHD energy
Yall disrespected nintendo by not talking about the video game crash and how nintendo singlehandedly saved the industry.
No mention of Pokemon which started from the Game Boy
Stick to reviewing phones my dude
I remember arguing with my parents to buy me a Ps3. We argued all the way and settled on a PSP. And we finally left the store with a Gameboy...........micro.
Bring back memories
U pay 10 thousand dollars to buy that
kept trying to figure out who that one comedian was....turns out he's like a majorish character from chang chi. The MARVEL movie.
"I didn't own any game boy during my childhood but I was lended by my friends back in elementary and now, I'm planning to buy one."
I was a SEGA boy.
handy boy by std :)
I like the gameboy flip. I probably got the name wrong - I was born in 99
"The horrible valley increasingly inject because relative contrarily balance until a violent antelope. bad, wiggly approval"
"Yup, game and watch and the brick game was the first handheld game I played with"
Most viewed video
The flamethrower part lowkey blew my mind
Do the Tamagotchi
I won this one in a magazine competition when I was 11!!!
You should do a show about the tech of the future
"""remember when you use to suck on your gameboy"" yes when my batteries was dead. Lol"
So happy the Game Boy is your most popular video. This tech was absolutely my childhood and glad I wasn't alone.
Time
This and Pokemon are the two great pillars upon which my love of gaming was built
please tell me he bought a used gameboy for the damage testing
"You remember when we had an attention span, before the cellphone? Lucky that we now have a ""universal remote"" ha, my cell does too many things and has its hands on so much of my data that many time's I'll search for random crap on Google just to diversify their AD targeting algorithm. Yeah, having everything all in one was excellent for big business but literally and psychologically trapped the consumer. I'll take nine device's over one any day."
"and more importantly, I'd say, ""Thanks, Nintendo!"""

"The commentators at the start saying kids in the late 80's early 90's had no entertainment and life was boring because no tablets etc...

GTFO

We had the BEST times outside exploring  and growing up away from a screen/tablet. Fingering, smoking, drinking and throwing up.. listening to gangster rap and thinking it made us hard."
"I lost my game boy purchased around 1993 about 5 years ago. Before I lost it, it was still working perfectly."
"The Sega Game Gear is nice too! Color screen, cool games!"
"Maybe next episode about amazing MEPS? Multilanguage Electronic Publishing System, it was revolutionary system for offset printing in a variety of languages and character sets. The system (completed in 1986) was designed by the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society."
Marques is like the most boring youtuber ever
"""Life in the 90's for kids were boring"".. *sigh*"
The moment he opened the carton I almost cried :D So freaking expensive nowadays if it's still sealed.

Watching this on my Nintendo switch
He couldn't even open up the game case with his soft hands lol
We had 4 original game boys in my house and we would all link up and play Tetris. My parents and grandparents both had game boys just to play Tetris
And then it took NINE years for the screen to be coloured and another SIX years for the screen to be back-lit.
I owned the evolution of this the Gameboy color it was yellow. Got it for Christmas from my great grandparents I believe the year it came out I was 4 almost 5 years old I got pokemon blue version with it and after that I owned every Gameboy system and every pokemon game I was hooked. I fell out of playing Pokemon with the death of the Gameboy lineage and only recently came back with sword and shield. Now I'm going to be trying to make a career out of the obsession my great grandparents started over 20 years ago. They're both gone now but I hope I can make them proud.
Hey youtube i already watched this video. STOP RECOMMENDING IT
I bought a used Gameboy color a year ago and I love it! I already changed the shell and I'm gonna install an IPS screen soon
"Someone probably commented about this before but, was that Toby McGuire at 6:43?"
7:22 Game Boy: I'm in trouble
Great job man!

wasteful
Just noticed MKBDs channel name changed.
"Yeah, burning something is not the greatest way to pay tribute to it"
Did he really destroy a mint sealed game boy ..
"3:53 you've never been more wrong. Life in the 80s and early 90s was great. Kids would be outside riding bikes, skateboarding, climbing trees, riding dirt bikes and four-wheelers, building forts in the woods, etc. Now we do all of those things virtually inside our homes, or watch other people do those things on tv and marvel about how cool they are."
Can YouTube stop recommending this video yet.  I'm honestly sick of it being pushed on me Everytime I open YouTube ..it's been going on for ever
That was my gaming system when I was 14-15! Couldn't afford anything better. $50 for GB against $99-129 for SNES
I always wanted one but couldnt afford one :(
"I was Born in 1996, My grandmother got me a Gameboy advance for my 5th birthday September 2001, I was addicted to that thing, can't believe I didn't hold onto it, where did all my things from childhood go :("
Just WOW!
Yep from 1989 here. Playing games in the 90s was a pain.
Bruh somebody call high five studios

"In the 80s, life as a kid was boring.

Me remembering being a kid in the 80s riding my bike all over the neighborhood, skateboarding, climbing trees, catching frogs...you know...boring stuff."
The good old day
Yes
nice video man
"The printer  worked great, always a great print, I think  the paper  is too old. I tried  to use my old paper  a year ago and it looked like yours."
MATT BELLAMY **fangirl scream**
This is a nice vid
That flamethrower part really hurt me and i was born in 1999.
im 2years too late but holy shit did it hurt my soul when you used a flamethrower on a piece of tech that changed my life as a kid... ;c
"Gameboy: *survives a bomb

Poor game boy
"I'm sure you don't check comments on a video this old, but I got so excited when you put Josh from Play Value on the screen.  I remember watching their series on older tech and loving it. Thank you for the throwback! This was a joy to watch."
"If can't open the case to the game, you need to walk away. This device was my gateway drug to my lifetime addiction to gaming. Yes I had that handy boy accessory back in the day."
Highly doubt he cut open the actual seal.
I just love the fact that they had a surprise tech underneath their chair and still they came prepared to talk about gameboy.
Those cases were amazing your just not that bright I guess
16:43 hi Tobey
Who kept i fu noring it till ages
"Wow, I was 9 years old when I got one. Haven't touched one in almost 30 years but I can still remember how that power switch felt under my finger."

Horrible
I remember watching this when I was 10
"OMG you guys, I found Mark Ass Brownlee"
Liked the video until I saw that heroin addict Casey
in 2009
Absolutely amazing job brother
im one of your top ten subs Marques... here we meet again
Where did he get a brand new unopened original?
14:05 looks like a power ranger morphing device
Christopher Nolan clearly inspired the beautiful creation of this video. The editing and cinematography of this Gameboy highlight video is truly outstanding. Well done!!
Gameboy was HEAVY AF!
Game boy advance was my favorite
Good video - but 20 year olds treating 30 yr old tech as archeology?  Btw the game boy was utter shit sega was better

""How old do you think Nintendo is?""
""70s?""
""1870s or 1970s?""
""Aw shit"""
I keep seeing this on my gaming tab of youtube TV so I'm just here to comment
Spiderman at 16:44 -no joke
It's is a pretty absurd notion that life was boring for kids before they got access to personal technology. Goes to show you how people have fetishized technology.
lol people payed really with their calculators on the train to pass time?
i still have my og N64
"You weren't even born at that time Marquez,  so its not your thing"
Sorry what is matt bellamy doing here LOL
Paved the way for mobile gaming.
"Whenever I hear that chime, it always bring me back to my childhood days where I was addicted in playing gameboy"
Also the printer isn't supposed to print like that it's malfunctioning.
The sonar and printer reviews were notes cause the guy needed to tap the glass or make a noise for the sonar to work. It seems like he expected the fish to be detected magically or something. SMH.
gameboy came from a guy spelling out 8008i35 on a train
"The DS sold more, so no it's not the most popular ever."
16:00 MKBHD to QR code converter
STD..? STD?!?!? WHO IN THE RIGHT MIND WOULD NAME THEIR GAME COMPANY STD?!?!?

I always envied kids that had a Game Boy. So imagine how I lost my shit when my parents gave me a Game Boy Color.
"It was a good video, until you blow torched the game boy. 7year old me would have given anything for the gameboy back in the early 90s."
No one did a better gameboy add ons than AVGN.
I almost cried.
Did u guys saw tobey maguire
That burn was hard to see but anyway good video
Pisses me of they torched it
Are you Chinese?.
Awesome other than burning one. I still own three.
"It's odd to see people refer to the GameBoy as some old relic before their time.  I'm 43 and basically got one day one when I was 12.  One factor that you youngins might not realize is that the Game Boy was pretty much universally HATED by the gaming press during its day.  It was not well regarded at all by the gaming magazines of the day.  It was commonly disparaged using the term ""LameBoy"" in all of the gaming press (EGM, GamePro, VG&CE, etc).  Every game review, every feature article would always ridicule the thing.  So it's important to recognize that it succeeded largely in spite of the press not because of it."
I was there when the Gameboy came out
"Him: Breaks seal.
Me: Makes Link taking damage sound."
"No; YOU could have done better there! Take the time to enjoy the details of the unboxing, instead of rushing and you would have opened the game cartridge first shot, guaranteed! Yes, you could have done better. Don't blame them, when it's user error."
I want to see the game boy color and Advance for one of your videos those are my child hood games
Her name is raja it's a man's name
Hang on there's no game gril here

Just come across this video. Total genius!!!
I unsubscribed from your channel a while back because I got so sick of your endless smartphone videos. Nice to see you tried something different.
7:07 fun fact: my uncle brought his game boy to war and my grandma used to send him batteries.
Who is here because this's the most viwest video?
"""Remember when u used to suck in ur game boy....or is it just me?....""
1 like on the video=1 prayer on that guy"
This entire series is just MKBHD making me feel old haha. Is 31 old now?!
"Game boy: survives the bomb blast

"Great video, gave me nostalgia."
*GAMEBOY*: the iPhone of gaming.
Far as the indestructibility they use thicker wires not like today trying to save money using thin wires case closed

Oi
The Nintendo Game Boy was truly built different.
"Tall Dark & Handsome Guy, blind folding people. Definitely this video was unique."
A true walk down memory lane.
Still got two of them when they first came out
"Theres something I absolutely loved about cartridges. They felt like there was a real thing inside it. It felt so much better to put a new cartridge in the console and see a new game come up than it is to just place a CD into a drive or even a tiny SD card into a Switch.
Theres more storage on the newer and smaller things but something was lost along the way. I feel like holding a game when I hold a cartridge like I feel like holding music when I hold a record. Todays digital world and tiny SD cards though? They do absolutely nothing to add to the experience, they subtract from it if anything. A great game doesnt need anything more, but something to hold just really does something to the experience."
.. deleted so..@#.
"I loved the Game Boy as a kid. :D All I had was Super Mario Land, but it was fun. :)"

"13:26 STD? STD???
WHO IN THE RIGHT MIND WOULD NAME THEIR GAME COMPANY STD!?!"
My brother and i loved our Gameboy. I remember we played it on the long plane ride from Texas to China and I beat my best Tetris score :)
I'll never forget the adventures of pokemon red and blue version on the playground. i lived 2 miles from a small town and would ride my bicycle into town to cut lawns all summer for anybody that wanted it. i remember saving enough to buy a cable cord to trade and do battles with friends. i miss those days.
Why am I getting this in my recommended 2 years later...
If only the switch was as durable as the Gameboy
"Lol ""Is it a GPS?"" Just... Wow."
Lovely gameboy
the guy that licked it needs a slap in the face for being an idiot

"Idk how much money I spent on those batteries while playing on my gameboy, that son of B sucked batteries like juice!!"
good work bro
"""Life for a child (in the 80s) was boring""!!! Not really. If you measure 'excitement' as gaming and on-demand movies, then you clearly need to get a life...!!!"
"3:21 - Now I can't be the only person who thinking ""mammaries!"""
Can't  believe these clowns get paid millions to play with gadgets. Let stage capitalism is so exploitative  it's not even funny
