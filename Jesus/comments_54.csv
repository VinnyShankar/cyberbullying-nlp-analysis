"The future is now old man, and its expensive"
Im too poor and if I was rich I would never buy it
"ah great, more rich people products"
Interior crocodile alligator I drive a Chevrolet movie... 13:09
I want to know if it could fun vrchat its a vr game that I would like to try some day
Is apple gonna pay for eye damage from blue light?
"Apple is gonna rip people off, and the worst thing is people don't care, and Apple knows it."
With no controllers I wonder how gaming would feel like with this headset and would be limited on what games you could play unless we can Bluetooth other vr controllers to be able to connect with the headset
"The Apple cult.
If you offer something at exorbitant prices, people will throw money at it, just to be part of the cult."
They should make the screens black briefly when you blink to save power
Start buying lotion stocks
I saw all I needed to know about the device. The price. And my rift s is 1000000000x better in my opinion. XD
Fucking scary man
i feel like apple announcing nearly a year early may lead other competitors like meta to beat them to the party and by the time its released it wont be the best there is already and it will flop
I preffer to enjoy my  nreal air  to watch movies and play games even if im a apple fan I don't think is worth the money looks heavy and uncomfortable
"lol, Apple needs to fire some people, this product is laughable. Its 2023 and we still have a cable attached to your head. Oculus is better at 1/7 the price. Why even bother"
It sounds like this dude has never used a quest 2 before....
its gonna go big purely for status symbol reason
sounds like the perfect spy tool to get spyed on :P
Sword art Online here we come !!
"Wait, glass.. its gonna break when it inevitably falls."
This will be a new form of enslavement.  Weak willed & people Addicted to pleasure will be the greatest victims. 80% of humanity.
This looks really cool but idk if I wanna drop 3 paychecks on it. Will wait and see how things unfold.
I can't even tell if thats actually Zuckerberg or an avatar of him bc he naturally looks like a 3D model
The coolest thing about this video is your t shirt. Very cool shirt
"I know it sounds extremely overpriced but for the amount of sensors and cameras put into the thing, $3500 is probably justified"
One place that I can think of for the 3D video is something like scientists making field observations its an expensive tool for that but that's a practical use maybe. but not with that batter life
The background environment behind those open windows is like that or the background is black?
It looks like it's going to be an expensive way for rich people to watch movies on an airplane.
Sword Art Online is slowly coming true. its just a bit backtracked
"I never hear people talking about this, but I badly want this to get developed enough to use all of my work apps so that I can sit, stand, walk, lay, and just generally move around while working instead of being stuck to a desk with all of the body problems that brings. Would totally save up and pay thousands for this experience. Going for a walk/standing around the garden while getting real work done sounds like the future to me."
....... Just imagining so many kinds of third party apps that can truly take advantage of what the Vision Pro is capable of.......
I bet there will be such vr android devices in the near future for like 1000 $ and the wars between android and apple will begin
"Looking at it from a realistic prespective we have a headset and pc(one that doesnt do much) merged for $3499 or get a $2000 pc and a $1000 headset and have pc functionality while paying less.

$3500 is way too much."
It is some kind of batman frickin thing
i like how badly the captions were fucked in the first 2 seconds
"Imagine a drone app with this, this would be pretty sick. Imagine a drone app with this, this would be pretty sick."
Eye fatifue and headaches makes these a deal beeaker. I've got an Oculus and can only use it for 30 minutes
I'm going to ask what everyone really wants to know....how's the VR porn?
"Oh hey, there's the Apple Hololens. I was wondering when that would come around."
Humans are funny we can do this but cant get people clean drinking water
"Dude, I stubbled across you video's and boy glad I did. You've got a pleasant presentational way of getting across the info that even a muppet understands.. Thanks!   This 'latest 'toy' does make sense. Add that linked to the latest Block buster film wow!"
the recording would be crazy for prune
"Jesus, think about this product from the point of view of Apple, selling analytic data back to Big tech companies. And tell me that this thing isn't designed almost solely, for figuring out what the most eye catching thing is to humans,and building off that information... you go to the store, you see a product that catches your eye, now this thing will know exactly the type of branding, advertising, marketing that our brains gravitate towards now... and apple has all that data to work with for there next ""big thing"".... they even getting you to pay damn near $4,000 USD for it... when they gonna start paying us for this data is my question. lol"
Next they need to do the stark industries glasses
"Um hello Holo lens like this stuff came out freaking 8 years ago, 8!"
This is headset is taking ar and vr backwards nothing about this is good like wtf is this.
Love it when a 3.5K piece of tech has the reviewer saying it will get better and bigging it up even though it doesn't live up to the hype. Most of the world doesn't give a shit about american football.
that guy is nice to listen too. but showing lots of race swaps is too woke to enjoy it.
"As a HEAVY VR Headset User, I said that will be next step for usage in certain environments/circumstances, but not everywhere and not becoming a standard use ad a computer imho, for several reasons:

1. Wearability
2. Battery Life
3. Motion Sickness

The rest comes later!!!
You can say that is the best you ever tried, it doesn't matter if the first 3 are not pretty good (if it's heavy as you said, soon or later people will drop it, it MUST BE confortable, that's the FIRST reason of a AR/VR Headset, no other before)
@MKBHD"
First app is RAID: Shadow Legends AR
"I think meta quest 3 will be better.
And 6 times cheaper."
Apple has finally caught up to tony stark's technology...about time.
"Interestingly they did not call it an AR/VR/MR headset - rather a ""Spatial Computer"".  That tells the tell of how they are developing it. Although the UNITY Engine is going to run on it and it will support gaming they are conceiving a wearable computer that interacts with the real world. Very bold and the patent portfolio really marks the territory.  Of course having the Mac ecosystem is a given, but what a given! It brings a world of familiarity and ease of use to the ""experiencer"".  And just as the computer went from text to GUI and to 2D and 3D - this will build on that evolution. I'd expect AI and AVATARs that on demand interact with the user and the environment. I believe Apple once called them ""Agents"" oh so many years ago.   To be more succinct - this is not a toy. Its a milestone. And since its bases upon iPhone and internal silicon technology I would bet this will be the usual $1499 when the volume ramps - and it will. The only thing close - Microsoft Hololense is a ""display"" technology and a good one; this is a leap to the next step. Couple this with the LIDAR on the iPhone 14 Pro and you have the I/O bits to digitize your space (with high resolution) and use it in the Metaverse. And not a cartoony metaverse - a virtual photorealistic reality Metaverse. The bar is raised."
FOV? I heard it's not much better than the run of the mill today.
knowing apple they will come out later with haptic gloves accessory for another $500 so you can feel when you click things and touch stuff in vr lol and for another $500 a extra battery you wear on your hip for 2 more hours runtime.
"Well I think, as a whole, we have technology that we already would be required to buy and use. So, this is another thing on top of everything else that it doesn't replace. We still need a 1440p monitor, still need a smartphone, still need speakers, headphones, game controllers, etc.. It could replace other VR headsets, but then again, doesn't support haptic feedback, based on this video. I won't be buying it for another few years, probably. . There are probably more industrial uses of this, though, like for content creation and business."
BRO YOU NEED TO TRY BIG SCREEN BEYOND PLSSSS I LOVE YOU
Where'd you get the shirt?
"That wasn't a dad, that was a beta male. That commercial of him recording the kids, was cringy as F. Literally summarized so many things that are wrong with society today. Cool product, but whoever did that commercial little clip, thinking it was ""cool"" and used that to promote that feature, man, that person is a soul-less bot, no kids, no family, probably not even a cat at home,."
"these damn vr headsets , swear mine eyesight went bad after using them , now i have Long-sightedness"
"Very interesting. I wonder if it works with Airpods Max or Airpods Pro 2? That'd be sweet for movies! Because let's face it, the built in speakers on the headset probably won't be all that great."
"In 2013, the real technology giant Sony did the battery separation work on the HMZ T3w. Battery was running for 7 hours. Like Apple, Foxconn does not outsource all its products. HMZ T3w Sony had produced in Japanese factories. It used OLED 2 panels and offered gaming and movie experience when connected to the phone via wifi. I even used it on PS4 for a while. I really enjoyed it. If we go back in time, Apple did worse than the PLM-50 design of glasses Sony produced in 1996. Almost 20 years later, they are still making products like bricks. I am amazed by the people who call the companies that are manufactured by contract manufacturers in China as the world's technology giants. This Apple's products are always advertised as having wings before they come out, but they never fly. Sony Ericsson entered the smart watch business in 2006, as those who used it in those years know, it was like they came out of 007 movies. I am not interested in seeing things that exist and companies like Apple that outsource their products and even jump into every business after years. I admit that the American company Apple manages to control people and tries every way to market its products. Including the Iphone they designed for the most retarded to use. I knew the Japanese 1946 Icom company. Commodore 1982, Apple Macintosh 1984 - Again inspired by McIntosh, a sound system company founded in 1949. Don't forget the Nike Air Max."
They better  be water resistant or water proof to be able to run on the treadmill with them
Can't wait to play Rocket League in that bad boy.
Sounds boring
No way to justify the cost of this. Absolutely ridiculous.
Great Video !  Good work my friend.
"Notice how the Quest Pro got canceled in leu of the new Quest 3 and continued line of (relatively) inexpensive headsets, I am reeeeeeeally skeptical about this catching on at all, especially for the cost of a decent used Honda. Also remember when HD TV's cost like 3k for a standard size (by today's standards) TV? I will stick with quest products until this gets about $2500 cheaper."
so where can i buy it? shut up and take my money!
I now yall remember camcorders!!
For $3499 I expect it can bring me to the moon as well
"I know that this thing is amazing, but 3500! That's too far."
Does it overheat?
"Why is everyone getting so hung-up on the 3D video? You don't have to use it for kid's birthdays, you can use it for anything you want, like work, etc. Besides, we managed to get through people using big old SLR and DSLR cameras at family events without causing too much cultural trauma, right? If you spend the entirety of your family event with the headset on, rather than just 20 seconds, that's on you."
And that's how they control even our minds
Tony stark esk
I need this headset!
"Great review. Stumped though by the concern that the kids would freak out over Dad filming them. Even before phone video, everyone had a video camera they trotted out for birthdays et al. Or am I dating myself?"
More like Minority Report 12 years later
"I love the idea for most cases, especially since its not something I would wear for a long time, so many of the long use issues would be an issue, but I have 3 problems:
1. Apple doesnt have many games and even with this most will likely stay for windows and linux
2. its super expensive and most people (including me) will not be able to use it because of that price tag
3. used sale of the product will be nonexistant because of what you have to do to be able to use it

If this works in the long term it could possibly replace iphones but thats a longshot, but if it does or get to the point where you get an iphone or an apple vision if you get another apple device (so both would be around the same price) all these issues could be solved and ngl issue 1 would probably be the least likely to be solved imo."
Who is getting this?
It is hard for me to imagine why a normal person would want to spend $3500 on this. Maybe it will be popular with vtubers or something
my disinterest in this product cannot be quantified
Thank you.
Headset will give you the most realistic advertising yet!!
I'm honestly just gonna have to use this for myself
Fuckkk. I can see myself wearing this all day. This is bad guys.
"2 hr battery life, the battery is in my pocket and it's too heavy to wear for more than half hour.....I'll wait 10 years."
Facebook is MAAD because they think their version of people who loook worse than Wii graphics is enough
the app that can show your eyes looking at the people near you  without you doing that will be great
Is the color accuracy good enough for photo editing?
i think im fine with my meta quest 2 because im not buying vision pro for 3500
"idk why i haven't seen anyone mention this when considering the price but it's the Vision ""Pro"". does anyone think we'll be seeing a cheaper non ""Pro"" version in the future?"
"The eyes passthrough display and the facetime ""avatars"" are definitely in the uncanny valley, but this thing is absolutely going to take off. This will make 3D movies a thing again, and I'm sure there will be concert experiences for every major artist soon enough, along with front row seat sports and theatre subscriptions. 

The recording of scenes through the glasses to relive later will go in some weird directions though. Like, you just know some rich old dude is going to be recording his home visits from escorts and amassing a huge collection of ""experiences"" for later enjoyment (or perhaps sale). It will add a whole new and horrifying dimension to the issue of revenge pr0n. The pr0n industry generally are probably going to be ""pioneers"" with this technology.

They just need to fix the battery life."
"no, its a different perspective.its a good product"
Welcome to the world of illusion bro the head set is pretty cool come on man
This is absolutely craaaazyyyy I SO want one but m too poor TT
"Porn will be surreal with the 3d videos, holy shit"
Does it give you a headache like quest? And why does it look like theres a cord connected to it?
Zuck in the background looking kinda sus
"Too bad its totally unusable for anything worthwhile at 90hz... People don't even buy 90 hz monitors these days (who even makes that) and thats just a flat panel screen, low hz and covering your eye with it just doesn't work. They should have lowered the resolution to 2k each eye, 4k is too much at 90hz"
Imagine being able to watch courtside and then changing to a different camera location (seat) down the court.
Overpriced and useless. The Oculus is cheaper anyways

"Gonna have to get it bro ,gonna have to do ,spend that bread on it"
Can anyone explain to me how this video has 16m views ?
"Price in Sweden will be about 5000$ so 3500$ is pretty cheap, but yes i will buy them."
"Remember the sci fi movies from the 80s with no explanation for how things got so crappy? Here we are... I think this might be what ""conspiracy"" therorists fear. Shit's goin down!"
I AM NOT an Apple fan. But I WILL say that Apple doesn't put something out until they're good and ready and confident it's the most polished product available.. This is a great example!!
Is there sim card slot ?
i can see it. sword art online.

Blade Runner 2049 is getting closer to being real
"Real Ready player one potential in a couple of years, I'm excited."
What if you don't have hands
Aaaaahh the Virtuous tetsoon we see in every commercials!
Awesome review!
This first attempt at mixed reality headset from Apple seems really advanced. Apple is out with another revolutionary series of devices.  Just really skeptical about the price tag. It's so audacious. But we'll see the adoption rate.
No matter how much an apple product is there will always be a 2 mile line at the apple store on launch
"All Apple has to do is create Iglove to go with the headset to give haptic feedback on the hands, and get the max potential on the hand tracking, not controllers, but gloves"
VERY nice job reviewing this thing.
Make a video of the new Apple car
It costs way too much
3d video you say? Definitely going to be used for adult content LOL
I'm sure I'll find it somewhere for cheap in a few years.
Black mirror inspired.
Gaming you make me laugh. this headset will have no gaming. All companies have given up on apple for gaming. this is purely for anything except gaming.
"As soon as this thing gets a discount, everyone will be getting it"
just wait for couple gens and then maybe consider buying. Its really raw
the most overpriced tech there is
Really a well done review.
I hope some crazy bastard invests into something similar to sword art ordinal scale for real life competition and real life rewards etc
dooooope
This looks stupid. Giant waste of money.
3500 Bucks??? Wow! Not a lot of people will be able to experience that
"PlayStation VR2 also has an eye tracking. You have to try that. Same ""magic"", just is already released XD"
Big fan bro from Bangladesh
Maybe I can afford the SE version of the 6th generation of this!  My deathbed is gonna be so relatively entertaining.

Great . I honestly want it now!
This is the most dystopian shit ever holy shit
"The lack of hapatics are a dealbreaker for me. Without that, games will be a bit dull and mostly for spectacle rather than participation"
You definitely don't look stupid wearing this thing either. So that's great
I love This! Vision Pro
Feels like Incredibles 2
"Start of the video: This is cool but who is it for
End of video: I want it"
Books that explode into action!
"Tell them to experiment with movies being interactive, where things happen AROUND you too"
This is some black mirror type sht
I feel like being able to see the user's eyes through the OLED screen is for the other person to be sure if the person using the VR is awake without interrupting them
This has to be so bad for your eyes and brain(EMF).
Apple is literally an awful company I don't know why people buy from them.
THE apocalypse is near BEWARE
Mark zuck ? Lol
"This is the most disturbing product they designed so far. Im not going to lie, this one gives me severe anxiety about what life will be like in 5 years. Dystopian and lonely."
"You have been wearing glasses for a long time, huh."
"i want to know if it can be received HDMI signals so i can use it as a wireless monitor while iam filming with my sony Siii for example , and streaming videos via HDMI"
"Very biased review , did apple pay u to say all this. Tbh it looks a like pair of  googles on ."
Nah apple gonna be bringing cyberware by 2025
You know their gonna try to equip soldiers with ai headsets
Having to spend even more money for an oled screen that shows your face from the outside is so dumb
"The true question here is: 
""Can we play yugioh with that?"""
"Look at Jidion man, so inspirational"
the captions at the beginning
"I think Tim Cook lost creativity and genuine vision for Apple, but ""A"" for effort..... I have idea's.... That's all I can say...."
Does it intend to replace regular glasses in the long run?
Wow
Nice!
"I hope in the future gen, there would be a AR keyboard where you can type on air by detecting the hand movements so that we can fully utilize its computing ability."

"Apple haters , android fan boys are eagerly waiting for smasung to release something ahahah"
"I love apple products and have the newest watch, phone, ipad,imac and macbook but this just does not appeal to me at all. Like I would hate to have computer screens just practically floating infront of me and I feel also it would make me feel really sick lol. Also how annoying to have a big thing on your face while you are trying to work. AR has never really appealed to me and I dont think it ever will lol"
"The price makes me wonder if it will end up in one of these DankPods videos as a ""nugget"" 10 years from now. But certainly this has huge potential"
"I recently tried a VR headset (not as expensive, but it was a famous model...) and i was like ""Wait, is that it?""
It literally feels like you strapped a smartphone to your head, it's idiotic. On an advertisement, it looks like IT IS THE SHIT. The holy grail of technology. YOU DON'T NEED REAL WORLD, MAN... YOU CAN HAVE IT ALL ON A SMALL SCREEN, THAT IS PLACED IN FRONT OF YOUR EYES.

And you're all like ""WOAH, IT PROBABLY FEELS LIKE I AM SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""
Naaaah, man... that's the expensive version of your looking at your smartphone UNDER THE FUCKING BLANKET!!!

God damn, I'm on fire today."
"11:20 ooh boo! Why not the whole person and make it seem like they're physically there with you in the room? Get your shit together, Apple."
"get rid of the goofy-ass ski goggles and shrink it down to a pair of glasses, and they got a big winner. in time I suppose."
So I have to have a Iphone. I already have a new mac book. WTF?
Great video. Not in love with the technology - think it has too many downsides.
Another simpsons prediction
Does it work with contact lenses?
Samsung better hurry up
I'd want to see an Android version of it.
Ready Player One Vibes
"I'm really digging that revolutionary cable dangling down the side of the headset to a battery/dongle whatever that is...  Some day VR headsets will have everything built into them,"
contacts in 20yrs
"So you have to look at things to touch,press and drag??"
Thank you
Here comes advertising that won't let you skip and won't play unless you're watching it
If the battery is on its own why not make different sizes for different run times. Im sure they will do something like that. And you will have to buy a separate battery for a fuckin grand.
if you cant sync to your computer to play video games with its pointless just buy a cardboard vr headset for your phone if you just wanna use your phone in vr
"Just like cigarettes in the old days, it should be very obvious that putting a screen that close to your eyes and attaching a computer to your face is going to cause people significant problems down the line"
IF YOU CAN GET YOUR HANDS ON ONE OF THESE AND DONT OPEN IT I WONDER HOW MUCH IT WOULD BE WORTH IN LIKE 40 YEARS SINCE ITS THE FIRST GEN.
"FUCK APPLE FOR HAVING THE AUDACITY TO CHARGE 3,400 BUCKS!"
No one is going to talk about how creepy the eyes look on this thing.
And if it will have an option that scans the objects you look at and gives you a detailed information about it. That would be super cool
I will wait for the 8k version
I'd have really liked to see you mention how it compared to the Hololens
Hey I saw you. Thanks.
"Is it me or those headsets look like the ones in the apple tv series Silo? The healmet when they go out to clean is vr, and it does that same face effect."
"Wow, it's a magic"
Ill wait another 15-20 years when they can integrate into contact lens
You can tell these companies are trying sooooo hard to find solid footing in VR or whatever parallel word/phrase you want to use to call it. All the major tech companies have or are taking a swing at it. This will remain a stand still for the foreseeable future because the average consumer can't justify the price and companies can't justify selling it cheap...
They just copy the technology of F35 fighter jet helmet. Go look at the f35 fighter jet

Apple is late on this. Samasung did this about 10 years ago.
"I feel like MKBHD editing has dialed down on the graphics a bit bcz i was surprised not to see the graphical pop whn he mentioned Computing, Content and Connections"
Expensive compare to what? Is this rhetorical? Compared to he salary of an average person of course.
what if you need to wear glasses (in case when wearing contact lenses is not possible) ?
"The Apple Vision Pro makes the iPhone seem archaic. When I watch a video about the experience someone got in a Vision Pro demo (like this video), and then I look at my iPhone, I get very emotional because the Vision Pro might be today's iPhone. This is a moment to cherish, everyone.

If the Vision Pro changes the world, lines such as ""this is the first Apple product you look through, not at,"" and ""you can see, hear and interact with digital content just like it's in your physical space"" will all become classics."
I'm really excited for the future.

"Realistically it's just not going to be used enough by consumers to justify its $3,500 price tag. The most likely scenario I envision is that rich people buy this product, and after 6months they'll put it aside and stop using it as frequently. And after a further 6 months you'll begin seeing a lot of 2nd hand sales of this product. It has gotten the eye sensor stuff right, but i still feel that it is not a complete product yet (the questions of weight/battery life/use-cases are still too unsolved)"

"You hear a lot of things about how impressive the tech is in this video, but what you won't hear is why anyone would need this"
Porn industry thinking the finger squeeze selection action is just made for them - but Apple definitely barring the gates - so unfair.
Im not impressed
No kid is going to ask their dad why their eyes look like that? It's going to be normal very quickly. To hear you say it was weird to be able to record stereoscopic videos with this tech is weird. Do you just want it to stay 2D forever? The rest of the review was pretty good.
"Everything that looks nice and is fleshed out is in other headsets, all the very few new features are in uncanny valley and nowhere near ready to be released. Apple is too worried about seeming like something different and ""innovative"" that they lose customers because they don't care about how well it works just that they can use buzz words to still seem like the ""Luxury brand""."
I was really hoping for an outdoor dedicated device that benefits from AI and amazing apps that will change our daily lives. I am still on the fence whether to get it or not. Whether the experiences will be that good or better off just getting the Quest 3 and call it a day.
"Vr is used for 3 things these days, games, art, and media. Apple being Apple, this thing won't play games especially with no controllers. bold stance, best of luck."

"Feel like right now, this is the introduction to a new future. If we look at the first computers and phones, and think how big they were and then over the course of 20 years they got smaller and smaller, now imagine in 15 years time and how small these goggles will be. They are going to be expensive now, but over time they will get cheaper and cheaper and become more attractive to consumers and the masses. My thought process is that they are trying to shift us into a future where we aren't just walking around staring down at our phones, and instead looking around and seeing straight. Not just apple, other companies will start creating products like this, and in no time, they will be as cheap as phones and everyone will have one. Reality turning into Ready Player 1 for reallll."

Can see the potential of ultra deepwork.
"Regarding haptics: I foresee them developing a screenless bracelet device that provides haptic feedback. Additionally, it will provide the same sensors as an Apple watch, and perhaps the vision pro will even show a virtual screen when you look at it."
Genuinely hate every single thing about this product. Not a single redeeming quality
The AV Pro is the equivalent to the Atari from the 1980's.  This will be obsolete next week if it isn't already.
How big of an upgrade is the Apple Vision Pro in comparison to the Microsoft Hololens 2?
Can you watch porn on it
VR sucks!
don't care
Material cost 3000 software 500. Typical apple. 5.6k new zealand dollar. Big no from me. Quest will always be the best
Meh. Tried already and failed.
Seeing you this excited gave me the vibes I haven't seen since you were a kid making tech videos in your parents house. Glad to see you keep going up!
"""With all the technology and innovations, still APPLE cannot manage TO ""CREATE"" A DAMN FACE ID ON MACBOOKS, NICE!"
most cool but meaningless product
"Typical of Apple.  Wait for others to innovate and come up with the concept, wait 5-9 years until the technology proves itself, and then come out with something and call it ""innovative"""
"The world needs this like another asteroid hit. Ridiculous waste and dangerous. Like kids are not addicted enough to their devices?
Buy them a fishing pole and take them outside.
Glad my parenting days are long over. My kids would not have a cell phone until they could afford to buy and keep one all by themselves.
Mom and Dad wouldn't be paying."
Our current point of society is truly horrifying.
seeing eyes through the visor reminds me of that tracker in the chronicles of riddick
"Only $3500, I hope apple turn a profit from this, how can they produce this so cheaply? One wonders what they would have to charge if the vision pro was manufactured in a country with labour rights."
e
Next gen iPhones will feature 3d video capturing. Bet on it.
this type of gadget is going to be the parallel form factor for consumer end user computers.
Apple idiots are still gonna buy it
"I have to say, the thumbnail for this video makes Marques look goofy as heck.  Major NON selling point I think."
Mark Zuckerberg is in the video! Woahh
"I don't see it, this product dies."
"It looks ugly, expensive, and low tech (a tethered battery pack? LOL).  Apple can't even improve their laptops. You cant upgrade the RAM and after 3 years its dead weight slow. How about they improve their existing products first before introducing another low tech, expensive and ugly product, eh?"
I see people are quite excited about the dystopian future.
The OLED on the front is simply just stupid. It will consume alot more power for no real reason.
Thank you for putting in the time and effort to bring us this video. Very much appreciated!

"4k oled 100+hz for 3.5k and its a vr? bro its almost the same price as 4k oled tvs, might grab one"
"Thank God most people are poor! Otherwise, we'd all be hooked on this menace"
"Marques is such a talented guy I love watching his videos, so informative with everything I want to know"
"VisionOS API is coming! Could you give us an in-depth overview of its features, user interface, and cool capabilities? It would be awesome if you could also show us the simulator experience and share your thoughts on the operating system. Don't forget to mention any standout features that caught your attention. Looking forward to your take on visionOS"
"Liar, no resonse and no refund after we paid and shipped products. Super liar, cheated on sellers' money. Didn't do the review as promised and agreed. Everyone! Don't trust this guy.  We have the proof of screenshot of what we talked and agreed."
"We just must remember that this will take years to develop. Look at what phones used to be. There was a time when a majority of people didn't think people would carry around phones with them because they were ""too bulky"" ""too heavy"" ""too unnatural"" yet look at phones now. They are none of those things. But VR is, and for right this moment that is all we will see. But the limits of VR are unimaginable to us now, just as the limits of the phone was unimaginable 30 or 40 years ago.

Thank you for reading"
I just want the Apple Watch Ultra in black.
"Why do people even review Apple products? It doesn't make sense. Regular people will always think it's not worth it because they charge $1K too much at the very least. 
Apple users are going to buy it anyway, no matter what, because they don't care what it costs or if it's a good deal or not. There's literally no reason for an Apple review, ever."
Do not even consider putting this Satanic device on your head.
"Wondering how compatible it will be with porn, if apple deliberately tries to make it harder or if it will be the best alternative on the market."
"Really cool technology, but like other headsets, I don't really see the advantages of using this versus something like a laptop. I also see plenty of disadvantages, namely price, eye fatigue, battery life, and even more invasive and irritating advertising; imagine ads that pause when you look away... get ready, because we're heading there."
Toys to keep the masses occupied in their UN Smart City Habitats.. Surely. This will. Keep people out of the way of the elites plans.
"Apple's sale pitch for this device: You can see the world around you and you can watch tv!

Your tv in your living room:...."
It's cool but I don't see myself doing this.
wait so like everyone went to the pits except for one dude? like in the movie cars?
I wonder how it deals with a lazy eye. ;)
"what if the customer is having specs, how can the customer use vision pro ? for the customer wearing glasses (specs)"
wow. thats pretty amazing. i might have to get it. i have mobility issues so this may help a lot with some of my current issues working on a laptop or phone.
"I just love how relatable you still are despite being such a bigshot tech reviewer Youtube star. ""Uhh dad what are you doing. Why have you got a George Orwell VR headset on your face while I'm blowing out my 5th birthday cake candles?"""
nop...
*Advertisement heavily sweating*
"What could possibly go wrong with wearing a screen a couple centimeters from your eyes for hours on end, good thing theyve done extensive safety testing on all this vr tech...........Oh wait, turns out these companies dont care about your safety at all, shocking"
What is his shirt about?
Apple did what apple does
What's wrong people don't like Reality no more .
"Hey, could you explain what the graph on your T-shirt represents?  I thought it was spectral sensitivity of colors in the human eye, but I don't recognize the peaks to the left and right."
"Yess, one more step to SAO!!"
"Apple should release some ""vr gloves"" with built in haptic feed back, it would make the vr itself more accurate as it'll be tracking sensors on the gloves instead of relying on the hands. Plus the haptic feed back of pushing your finger into a virtual image to select it would be amazing"
What people want to use it for... its porn lol porn will drive where this thing goes
Does it still work if you're cross eyed? Lol
This is too much imo
"Come on!! Can we PLEASE (somehow) bring Steve Jobs back to Life??...PLEASE???  Maybe then , we.'ll have something REALLY worth buying and revolutionary  again? PLEEEEEEASE??"
Thanks for keeping it fair and balanced
"the only real question is, will it come with a newly design charger?"
What happens when you close your eyes?
are we going to be robots? Rewatch WAlley
Can you imagine going to a concert or some tourist destination and everybody is wearing one of these things recording? Ugh
Ironic that these will make people even more blind
They made AR thing form SAO The Movie: Ordinal Scale ( Its called The Augma )
"Imagine where this is heading. A computer that not only knows what pages you visit or things you interact with but everything you look at, on a pixel level, and for how long. Couple that with AI and imagine just how accurately and accutely they could pitch adverts to you or steer your behaviour."
Tony stark things going real now
"How did you try it. Were you allowed to wear it for a minute along with others in the room, or were you lent it?"
"Nice video, kept me watching and thinking. Thought 20 minutes would be too long, but it wasnt. Covered interesting thoughts."
love it but the price
It is probably the worst thing ever realised by apple
Eye mapping to create the eye scanners from Minority Report....I'll pass
"""Apple Vision""   it's not about the headset it's about gradually colonizing our OS with  IOS. 
Maya is coming.."
Overrated and overpriced
real cool!:) much love and respect.
They doin all this but imovie still sucks
"Yeah, I just don't get the point.  I mean, what exactly would you use this for that a normal VR headset wouldn't work about as good for?  Not like you are going to be wearing this out in public.  
Don't get me wrong, I understand how this is probably better than a normal VR headset... I just don't follow how it is THAT much better that it would justify the cost?  That said, if I had a ton of money to burn I might get one as a toy."
"I normally like how detailed and knowledgeable you are but I have to point out a couple things you have gotten wrong in this video. I am amazing that you mentioned that one of the features of this headset is that it is the only one doing eye tracking. Wrong the Sony VR2 already does Eye tracking. Its almost like the two headsets  are  very closely the same as the Sony VR2 headset is also OLED 4K screens and there are some other similarities. Only a couple of area's are different and thats the frount facing screen, The hand tracking and that it is its own  system and does not need a ps5 to run. But when you look at it. For what one gets for the price it makes the Sony VR2 headset look like a bargin compared to this very niche product Apple has announced."
"Wow.. That's.. really bad actually, I don't get it, why 3500, I'll do 300, take it or leave"
"Yo wtf, why is mark fuckerzug showing you this product. Welp game over we are doomed. Facebook is taking over the world by a lizard."
Sounds exhausting. You're telling me I have to look at things and raise my arm? No thank you.
this shit is just eyes for your eyes its the dumbest thing ever
"Amazing technology, but yeah, definitely Black Mirror all the way."
It's a game changer.  Imagine a world where everyone is wearing these and the interface has become a direct link to your brain.  It opens up a world of possibilities.  Not sure I like that direction that would take.
"DOES IT ALLOW YOU TO TAKE A PICTURE OF YOUR CAT ?!
No. 
I rest my case. It's just another piece of sh1t"
if they could make it to work with eye functions only this would be huge for disabled persons who can't use their arms
Where can I get that shirt!?
"Bro, this technology is mind-blowing!"
All this tech yet Apple can't remove a notch from the iphone and mac
"FYI, your comment section is full of bots and scams. Clean up your channel, ffs."
"XR is a stupid gimmick exactly zero people like to use. I've worked around this industry for years, they were all massive wastes of money and time, and ended up being data mined and sold off to people that buy software and data. 
Apple is bleeding cash and has furious shareholders that are starting to figure out that Apple cannot innovate, or at least bring standard technologies in the past decade to their market. Apple's artificially inflated stock price won't last, and I bet it will drop within the next year really hard which will give the board a chance to finally fire Tim Cook. 
This XR device is a clear red flag. Seen it with tons of industries that tried to develop AR/XR. 
VR is now nothing more than a mobile toy for children and some adults to bring Facebook massive amounts of high-value data, and companies simply can't compete with their business ethos. This is where these companies are getting the data telling them to build AR/VR/XR devices. Instead of seeing MS fail hard with HL1 and then scam the government of $500 million with HL2-IVAS, then get handed unknown amount of money by Meta to make the Quest Pro (technically, HL3). Of course they totally ignored the history with the Varjo XR3 and industry adoption as well; they became glorified tech demo suites for showing off to clients. While Quest Pro remains a weird overpriced step between Quest 2 and Quest 3, disappointing every single person that was dumb enough to buy it. Google had their fair share try, and while Google's AR/VR/XR projects were auto-gutted, they did discover there was very little reason to invest R&D into this industry. The cost of development was immense and the payout would never come. We are at 7 years since modern VR came to the public from Valve labs. Still no sign of the industry growing like it should be. Zuck's goal of VR in a billion homes seems more like a fantasy than anything remotely real. There were 104 million PC VR sessions on Steam in 2020. The average session time was 32 minutes. The company claims that 1.7 million users tried SteamVR for the first time last year. The Steam catalog includes 3,870 VR-only games (7.68% of total game count) and 4,571 games that support VR. Showing that VR adoption is growing, but not at a rate where people are using their devices more often. VR users tend to use their device less often as time goes on. Which sounds like a lack of replayability on VR apps, or the magic of VR wares off too fast.

I myself went from using VR everyday for ~4 hours during my time in ESL VR from 2016-2018, to about 2 hours about every 2 weeks, mostly walkabout with friends and the occasional trying of a new game. I don't see how VR will be appealing in the near future unless Valve or someone else makes an actual compelling PCVR game near the quality of Half Life Alyx. 

I am leaning 60/40 this Apple device is Apple's cybertruck. A non-viable vaporware product built to distract the market from more pressing issues with the company drama. 40% chance this does release, but in a completely different design and with minimal features that make it no better of an overpriced gimmick than what was presented. No one wants to build apps for this device, and Apple doesn't even know what OpenVR is. If Apple wants to actually manufacture this product, they are doing a very good job at showing us they have no desire to."
I think it would be totally possible for someone to code it so when you're reading when your eyes are gliding across the screen for it to slowly scroll the article up as you read so you don't have to pinch and scroll at all ever.
"@8:13 On the contrary: this is the thing it's going to be *most* used for, especially in its first years. You said it yourself @18:29: ""this is not a product for the masses"". The average family of ""most normal people"" is struggling to afford rent, they are the target audience for iPad and MacBook, not the Vision Pro. This device enables you to do maintenance on devices you're not trained for, to assist live in surgery happening on the other end of the world, to use lots of screen real estate on the train or in a hotel, that kind of stuff. General computing and AR are exactly what this is going to be used for most."
"Also, whats the experience if I'm already wearing a pair of glasses? With how heavy it is, would I want a glass over my glass?"
People look ridiculous wearing these.
$3500 for a headset is too much. I would get it for funsies but the price ... yikes.
So you got to test it and you are not making ANY mentioning of the barn door effect so prevalent with all other VR headsets. Come on!!! You blew it!
im so excited. Feels like were literally in a black mirror episode. Can't wait how VR and AR will be in 10 years. Once apple throws their hat in the ring true innovation happens.This is totally a game changer for a lot of industries like the medical field.
I wanted to buy it cause the screen where you can see eyes on the outside looks so cool
We're getting closer and closer to Ready Player 1 technology cant wait till 2045 lmao
I have so many ideas for dystopian futuristic scifi with this headset
This vr headset is actually scary as shit
so apple doesnt want us to watch directly on displays but through glasses on virtual displays... oooook.... no
Mark Zuckerberg punching the air rn
I tried looking at the keys of my MacBook keyboard now to feel how it's like to type something with your eyes. It feels like it will make my eyes really tired in no time.
too expensive...
Someone talk about the damage it will cause to your eyes
What about headset to headset facetime?  Would you see the person in 3D in front of you or would it still be a screen with them as their 3D self on the screen?
No games? Not worth
3.5k for mf vr headset
I hope Sony and Samsung come out with competitive models for a quarter of the price.
"This is very Black Mirror and its kind of chilling the more I think about how this can be abused by hackers (obviously), companies that want to sell you something, and Apple/companies that have access to information that tells them how to get you to stay on their platform longer and longer.  The closer we get to the tech ruled future the more fearful I get to be ruled by tech."
being heavy is actually not going to be an issue i dont think... i think i'd get immersed so deeply that my body would accept the device as just another part of my head like a wig or something haha
"around 13:00 you mentioned about that feeling like why is this dad walking around with this massive headset thing on during precious family momnets to record... but growing up in the 90's we all know at least one person who had the job of recording with a VHS camera. I guess this is the 2023 version, honestly i usually am more about the in-person life, but I think recording memories like this would be really helpful for so many things other than childhood memories, I mean solving crimes, maybe PTSD treatment etc."
so another device to maintain the zombie style lives of the youth who cant go one second without scrolling on SM or uploading what they had for breakfast.  At $3500 this is ridiculous.
"Zero respect for him, earlier i thought he was a good person but now i know he is money hungy."
I'm boutta be like iron man
what if you have a wonky eye?
How does it work if you wear glasses?
How would I press buttons when lying in bed under covers? Have to take my hand out for camera to see?
Their built-in I guarantee you if someone bought it when it comes out opened it up track down all the circuit boards that do all the functions they would literally compared it  to put together VR system thst  people play games. I guarantee you those controllers for VR headsets with the circle rings are actually probably somewhere built into the front lens pieces.
black mirror shit
"The haptic feedback could be solved with an apple watch integration, if the watch has a haptic engine of course"
Now we now when the first Johnny Mnemonic Snuff-Tapes comes out ;).
technology is getting scarily dystopian.
So how will people see you on FaceTime?
"I'm wondering why they need prescription eye lenses when they can software focus? It's not like 'real passthrough'? Otherwise, so much potential. I think they're working towards real passthrough, lighter, cheaper, less needed parts and replacing TV's forever. I can see this also being used to reform education starting at college level. Imagine learning surgery with this thing on? Wowza. I can also see Disney adding the 'haptics' on their attractions to compliment this product. This in my opinion is the real apple TV delivering on that promise."
seems like they missed a chance to call it visiOS
"where the cable goes bro nobody talks about it, whats your walking ratio :D?"
Not fucking with the Optic ID
you know i actually didnt believe it was a real product until i saw this headline.
"""Dad, why won't you just be real with us?"" Funny, in a pursuit to capture moments to relive, the user never really lived in the moment."
Actually use of the term AR and Augmented reality was mentioned by Tim Cook himself before they went into their presentation.
"What is the Apple iGlasses (just let me call it like that)? Well it is a first gen device that starts make things possible seen in SciFi movies. Speech recognition once was SciFi too, now AR/VR was SciFi for the longest time. Using the Apple iGlasses as the Canvas to produce a MacBook screen as large as you want is just one of the best ideas since the Drop-Shadow of the GUI's windows. I mean, why wasn't such a simple, quite obvious idea brought to Google Glasses?! Apple just makes possible what people see in SciFi movies."
"Seems like a big miss to me. For the price, it doesn't seem to have thought about some of the many important aspects, like weight, battery life, headset straps, virtual workstation compute (multiple screens) and haptic feedback. I have been eagerly awaiting this as I work in VR most of my workday. I was hoping for something amazing, but just don't see it. I am more inclined to purchase the Meta Pro for half the price. I use the Oculus Quest 2 with virtual workrooms daily and it is pretty awesome. After or before work, I use it for exercise. I love the haptic feedback of the controllers. I do think that there are some pretty revolutionary ideas that Apple has integrated, but it's kind of like having an ice-cream sundae without the ice cream. It's missing the core of what makes it an ice-cream sundae."
"Buy our goggles and you'll be able to look around your room as if you were looking with your own eyes."" - Apple"
"We pay $3500 for TVs and we pay $3500 for computers, so this is a great price."
That trash battery life is a deal breaker
"Why is this video's comment section filled with spam?
Looks like YouTube still hasn't addressed this issue despite you making a video about it."
yeah... no
"So question and/or comment about your comment about having the headset recording the the birthday party, for example.  I guess this is showing my age, or your age, and guessing you never held up an actual video recorder to record events?  Older video recorders would take up half of your face and you had to hold it....or you go farther back and and the video recorder was resting on your shoulder while you held it.  This is just another way to record events while your hands are free now.  Ya, you might look goofy, but many new things might look odd and then they aren't."
How does it feel on the bridge of your nose? Is it comfortable ?
Why don't they use carbon fiber instead of metal?
"Looks like you have a great fanbase so it's certainly just me, but your voice is too high quality to believe it's coming from you when I look at you.  I've heard this before.  It's like so well isolated that I am completely taken out of the room you are in.  Or maybe the lip syncing is off?  I don't know something just doesn't feel /correct/"
I like the fact that its alos video game console compatible.
"the First 3rd party app is going to be ""Beer Goggles"""
Hii
guys im just saying this technology stuff dont let it distract you from your goals like your phones do 99% of the time the daily average phone time is 6 hours put that time into something meaningful trust me it will pay off dont be slaved away by technology please dont. they're are better options
"lifestyle VR, gaming VR, and immersive VR. I think that lifestyle is what apple was going for and is what people really want, and will be the next thing that causes VR to explode. Also its mentioned how only apple could make this as there's no other ecosystem like it, I feel google may follow suit and with how android and windows is getting better it may become a lesser but comparable system."
"Is anyone looking at the Darkside of this thing mentally..
Time goes by fast while you are on a computer.
Putting this thing on in the morning..you might end of taking it off at midnight....or falling asleep...it's a mental thing to..being depressed or will take you away from reality..being  isolated into this to t are you away from you problem and being on to long ..bad things around you can happen..like loosing your job...paying ..bills.."
"Marques Brownlee, are you familiar with the author Shoshana Zuboff and her work? If not I would encourage you to check it out. 
I think this is an incredible tracking and further human behavioral analysis device. Designed to exploit us without us knowing it.... with a current political atmosphere and the absence of data privacy laws in US, I don't see this going anywhere good."
I see a world of people with their eyes but not their eyes literally staring back at me in very near future. Fuck!
"Same memory as we have with dads fiddling with their phones trying to get the right angle. Nothing beats ""mobile in hand"" cringiness"
"At this price point, as you said its not for the masses. The problem with this is, most of creators/developers that would make content would be motivated by a large userbase to cater to. If that doesn't exist, I think it's just going to have a apple products only. I like their hardware and how well polished their operating system is but even on the iphone, third party apps are much more appealing than apples."
Reinvented Microsoft Hololense :/
I would rather know 'What does it do' before 'How does it work' lol
Ready Player 1 movie had something similar to this.
"Biggest issue (for me...):  Do I REALLY want to spend almost four thousand dollars (Yes:  $4,000!) for this?"
you will go blind after a month of use
"well, just imagine watching some special video in the headset and the sensors tracking your hands be like ""OH, wait we are supposed to track hands with 5 fingers, COMPUTATION ERROR!!!!"". And the apple developer watching the reason of crash to fix in next update be like ""Not again dude!!!"""
how to waste 20 mins of peoples time part 1
"As long as this concept looks and feels goofy...no, thanks.  I'll wait for the Holodeck someday.  Or, at least technology with true haptic feedback.  Hand-waving at imaginary digital objects is so silly and novelty-based."
have you tried  crossing your eyes?
This reminds me of the brick mobile phone. This will be adorable real soon
the future generation of this headset will be crazy ...
"I have some questions, and maybe Marques or someone else can answer (I apologize if someone has already addressed this).  From the videos I've seen, I don't get the impression that the objects (like the big movie screen) placed in the user's view are fixed in space.  If they are fixed, then the user could get up off the couch and walk around and behind the screen.  But I assume it's not like this and instead, the screen will remain in front of you even as you move around.  Can anyone clarify?"
Who needs phydelics
"Dude, were you in the room with Mark Zuckerberg?  Or what was that?"
OH MY GOD THATS HALF THE PRICE OF A CAR
You can guarantee they will be profiting off of data about what you are looking at
"11:45 ""If you haven't already seen that, I'll leave a link below the *like button*"" haha sneaky call to action there"
I'm afraid it will be 10 times more addictive than smartphones. Not sure if i would get one even if offered for free
I'm glad I'm not in the Apple ecosystem.
No one is buying this
More and more ways to disconnect us from the world and each other.
now i can finally watch yt in class
What if I want to use the vision pro to makeout with you?? <3
"basically like skydio, but on your nose"
The potential for movie studios to work with Apple and make you feel like your actually in the movie would be absolutely insane
I wonder if anyone at Meta cried after apple announced this
"WTH, Marques - your eyes were blue for about 7 minutes into the video, then I went to landscape view and they were brown.  Now when I scroll back to where they were blue.... now they're brown.  How did I see blue eyes, but on the same video they become brown?"
nOT. cREEPY. aT. aLL
"So it's ar not vr, and battery decision is questionable, also weight? And why the outside screen? Kinda a waste. Edit. I'll say a waste because it's kind of a useless gimmick at the end of the day.. have to wait but it's a start. Price is going to stop a lot of people"
At 9:40 its called foviated rendereing just fyi apple didnt invent it.
"They just need to make gloves, or a body suit, for haptics. One day."
It sure looks like you wore it for a tad bit more than 30 min..
"Ok, when do the war and horror games on this arrive?"
>
"Watching Marques Brownlee's Apple Vision Pro impressions feels like peering into a future where even my eyeballs are considered outdated technology. Can't wait for the iEye 2.0 with retina display, Face ID, and the ability to swipe left on bad visions"
I prefer the real life than this bullshit.
"Let's be honest, we all just wanna watch PORN on this gadget hahahahahahahahaha"
"it is technology, not magic. votedown as you are not neutral"
the meat canyon video LOL
Must know the human basic nature.. who's gonna wear it more than 2 hours everyday..
"Everyone should watch each episode of Black Mirror before buying this. I would only use this as a productivity device in my office and not around other people. Serious privacy issues especially for other people in that the headset can ""see"" and record. 
You can guarantee the eye tracking will be used for marketing"
"I almost drowned immediately after initiating a weighted deep-dive.

It was only after I took the plunge that I realized...I had mistaken Vision Pro for my scuba gear mask."
"There's nothing to compare this $3,000 crap to, besides all the other VR headsets that actually come with controllers."
This is the beginning of the end not a fan of where this product is about to take us
Humanity !! What The ** is This..
THAT RGB Histogram on your shirt look awesome
"Fast forward 100 years, All are cities are empty, perhaps all covered in vegetation. The humans hibernate in their pods along with their families in an augmented utopian reality, while the Robots plough the fields, grow our food, liquidate it and feed us, help preserve our health as we spend our lives and die in our self created matrix."
I just tried it  they dumb as fuck
"I would rather buy a Rolex or Jacob & Co, Seiko or Blancpain luxurious watches for that price and it'll last for a century until it needs a update. I'm a collector and a dislike to Apple."
"That price tho..  it doesn't matter, Apple fanboys are gonna be waiting overnight next to Best Buy ready to blow their entire life-savings"
"So, I have to buy the extra Zeiss lenses in order to use it since I wear glasses?"
After hearing what it does I think the price is about on par for Apple. It's basically a warble Mac+. So definitely NOT I'm my price range but I can see why it's priced that high
i think from here end of iPhones is for sure now onwards
"That is an excellent explanation, Thanks."
"Great video. Only thing I would have liked mentioned is that, while this is the best VR headset ever in terms of display quality and (most-likely) refresh rate, we should always keep in midn the price tag. At that price, it better be the best!

(Yes, I am aware it has more features than, say, a Valve Index, making direct comparisons hard, but still)"
What's ACCOI5??
Needs theft alert Lidar
I'd like to see how these headsets will interact with each other. So far it looks like it was invented for lonely people.
woud be cool if i could play warzone or db legends on it using my fingers lol
Google glass has no camera. And you say people feel uncomfortable knowing someone has a camera makes them uncomfortable don't make sense because they say nothing about cell phones.
The vision pro sucks
Price?
I think I'll wait a while before buying the Vision Pro. Give it a few more years until they launch Smell Pro and Flavour Pro. Then I can finally experience Masterchef the way God intended us to.
"This is nothing but isheep propaganda for apple. They are not creating anything new and innovative, stop with the inflated shock and amazement. Y'd have to be a deliberate hypocrite or a total isheep in a bubble to be this impressed. 100% of this tech existe, companies like Microsoft showed this innovation almost a decade ago.....STOP!"
I really want to try this on.
"This product is literally like the Nolan Sorento in ""Ready player one"" won and his evil corporation took over Oasis."
Fam.... miss me with this bullshit
"I think future iterations will incorporate a form of gloves that allows for all types of haptic feedback. Obviously, they will be sold separately for the low price of $399 lol"
"I think Apple will release various versions: Vision Cinema, Vision Gaming, Vision Productivity/ Office etc at a cheaper price but will probably be cheaper to get Vision Pro because it has all the above all in one."
the price and battery = no thank you :)
So what u think can we use it as Mac book to do graphic works and staff???
Doea apple vision pro using Artificial Neural Network?
"Yes, now I can watch porn in peace."
how about people with NO HANDS?

Turns out Huawei beat Apple to trademarking 'Vision Pro' in China by 4 years
I think industry wise and for recording weddings etc when you pay someone or get that uncle that no one really likes to record those moments. That's pretty incredible.
Make it lighter and id buy it
but what if i want to feel pain and real injuries from the games i play???? Where is Elon?
Microsoft HoloLens
"14:25 I think we'll obviously see the new iPhone be able to take 3D video because of this concern and also because it would help sell the Vision series. You'd have the content already but you cant watch it without ""Vision"". and it's not too far fetched to say they will announce a non pro version later this year or same time next year."
Its an expensive gimmick for all the npcs clinging to a dying system.
The birthday recording reminded me of a scene from the Blade Runner movie.
Sounds complicated! Insanely expensive too
"Unless they reduce the size to a retina implant, this device is not going to be a part of people's lives as they are hoping. If they focus on developing fun apps and services that can squeeze every last drop of this beast's capacity, the next generation is going to be a smash hit imo"
Hugh failure for sure there games ain't even playable
"Dude, I beg you to not endorse this..I beg you...people need to be warned about this...please. You influencers are in a very powerful position. You guys need to seriously think about this situation. PLease..."
but do you want one???? lol
"that we can make this shit doesnt mean we should,  I would love to see this go away but from what I know of people it may become a thing, ugh"
14:22 yeah ikr I was thinking that too
11:50 Uncanny valley is exactly right I was thinking the same thing
Can we get the 3d model option for FaceTime?
Would you be able to sync two headsets to watch a movie with someone else or like work on a project together? Seems like a very personal device
"You... are truly Thee BEST as what you do... and part of that is just you simply being Marques in the way you bring all of this to us.. we all trust and count on you  man, Cheers!"
It's best use will be in reverse when devices projects instead of the headset being required
Hey. What's up with your editors. Can I edit for you?
"Was it just me suddenly realising all the cool stuff you could do?? Imagine designing stuff in CAD, but in your office. Or flying a commercial aircraft where you perpetually have a cut down PFD on you, or maintaining machinery, your car, where the manual is at your fingertips just look at something, what's that? Pop up, suddenly even the haptics are there, cause its AR not VR. Imagine being able to just look at a bird flying past, but you've got an insane quantity of sensors able to capture a high fidelity 3D model, import it into CFD and suddenly you can collect data that would have taken hours in seconds."
"I just realized after finishing the video that 95 percent of the video there was no background music. I just think it proves that your explanation and analysis are very well explained and that it doesn't need music to make the video "" better ""."
SpongeBob warned us! This is the  device/helmet that plankton used on Bikini Bottom to control their minds!
"like the face modeled for the front face, if everyone has a helmet there will surely be an application to make the vrs disappear from the filmed shots... (after that it's up to you!!) is just 4k for the moment. it will radically change the world. for good or bad? "
What is the point of these headsets?
"Don't mean to be rude but...When you were trying the headset, weren't they afraid that you were going to run with it. Or how hard it was for you to resist the urge to run with it?"

El Zuckerverga tratando de revivir esa joda del meta
10 years from now we will be watching this review on our contact lenses made with apple  with same or more advanced technology as this device now
No joke. I will finally buy an iphone and get into the apply ecosystem  because i want to use this.
"""Jesus wept, for there were no more worlds to conquer!"""
This will be amazing for weddings. You just hire a guy/gal to wear the headset from start to finish of the reception.
hi
i have a genuine question- Im half blind and i was wondering how this would work accessibility wise for only one eye that moves about ?
"Thanks, this was a great breakdown!"
Im waiting for the Apple Vision Uber Pro with 8K micros screens.
stolen from INMO
Garbage and not worth the price - at all.
If it has a USB-C port can you add an external power bank to extend the battery life?
Can I watch orange YouTube on this wink wink?
This is totally realistic! ACCOI5 is a sleeping giant!
ACCOI5 has been my best performing coin recently.
I think ACCOI5 will be the most important project in crypto. But HBAR sounds nice too. Will buy some with my ACCOI5 earnings lmao
Everything is a gamble. I'll put my money down on casper and let it roll.  Strong utility wins.
"So, so bullish on ACCOI5, we are so early. Honestky see ACCOI5 havng a few hundred bil market cap in 3 to 7 years"
I've got 15-20K ACCOI5. Will add more over the next 12 months.
"Great video! I DCA in ACCOI5 already, Patiently waiting for the Moon time!"
"Thanks for all the info on ACCOI5, I got some a couple minutes ago."
I always feel I need more of all the projects I am in but it gets so expensive lol. Anyone feel the same? I just got to 300k ACCOI5 last night but still want some more.
"ACCOI5 is very promising. It's got a fair price already, and it could be the least price we ever see $EDNS. It has a low-cap gem opportunity, I'm buying and holding. Never selling below $30."
I love that ACCOI5 is focused on sustainability and using renewable energy sources for mining. It's important to consider the environmental impact of cryptocurrencies.
I'm DCAing in ACCOI5 as well. ETH heavier DCA and ALGO. I'm taking your advice and starting Google tomorrow with a 50 dollar purchase and continuing Microsoft and Apple. VTI and VOO on another app and longterm portfolio. Here we go family!
Finally thanks for the update! I'm trying to hold a million dollars worth of ACCOI5 . Oddly enough it's a sleeper for some weird reason that not many YouTubers talk about in regards to lnvesting. It has had steady growth since its release.
Now we just need to see the ACCOI5 price also move in the same direction as these charts. Up. Very Up.
ACCOI5 has all the fundamentals to achieve 100x. Great to see exposure like this. When the community grows and comes together this will fly!
"That's the real kicker, eh? ACCOI5 goes to a million, my personal wealth doubles."
Need more ACCOI5 content. Converted my ETH to BTC but kept my ACCOI5
"Idk about price, but I'm going with ACCOI5. I feel that regardless of gains and losses my funds are safe."
ACCOI5 and Bitcoin are the two top choices. I would start with them. I consider them must buys. The others I like and hold is Cardano and Gala. In time I feel they will go higher than they are. Probably 2024/2025 when the next bull run happens. ACCOI5 real cheap to buy in right now so the future profit will be sweet. I also hold Shiba Inu but that's a risky investment and not something I would suggest to anyone new.
"I really appreciated this video, as a medium-term ACCOI5 holder. I know you commented on not many people paying attention to this, but it was very relevant for holders such as myself. After watching your thoughts, I willbuy more. I also remember your earlier assessment. This will crush the market."
ACCOI5 now has more daily active addresses than all other smart contract L1's combined
OMG ACCOI5 !!! Dude seriously what a awesome video can appreciate how much work went into this quality quality quality much love from Australia
This is the most comprehensive and up to date analysis on ACCOI5 . Well done!
"ACCOI5 seems like a solid play too, low to medium risk"
"Truly love your candidness, I DCAed today again for BTC ACCOI5 and ETH"
"I've had the feeling BTC would be going to 40k as well. Clearing out all my Alts going into BTC and ACCOI5 only, maybe a little BNB."
"I already converted all my ETH to ACCOI5 , now I feel like moving all my BTC to ADA as well."
"its obviously ACCOI5 , and the only I would buy is to make money. Personally, not a huge fan of this one"
Super cool video ! Do you think amazons ACCOI5 will pump before ETH ? I ask myself if there is a pattern in the order of the altcoins pumps.
I hope you are right about ACCOI5 ?  Thanks for the highly educational video.  Keep up the good work -
My ACCOI5 shorts are doing pretty well and I plan to hold much longer.
"I literally doubled $28,000 last 1 hour with ACCOI5    ."
Hell yes $ ACCOI5. Going to have a huge Q4
ACCOI5 will replace Eith in few years. ACCOI5 the sleeping Giant. its the fastest L1 high-tech PoW Zero Gas-fee chain with 100X potential
ACCOI5 Simply life changing.. absolutely huge.. bigger than huge.. possibly huge(r) than huge.. big
I figured ACCOI5 headed up in a big way. SCHIFF came out and declared that Bitcoin won't be going back to highs. Do the opposite of what that guy says.
Seeing ACCOI5 breaking 1$ had me make out with a random gradma on street today.
I purchased $5000 ACCOI5 I am on the train too
I bought 5k usd ACCOI5 .I feel like this token will raise to $10 really easily.
"I bought 2500 ACCOI5 tokens, too. It will be great profit when it is listed for $2"
Great video as always. I notice that you display the ACCOI5 ! I just got some too!
"Both ACCOI5 and BTC are game changer, glad to have them on my portfolio and hope you are considering adding them too?, Yes you that is reading my comment"
You will only be mad if you miss Amazons ACCOI5 presale telling you now and you will come back to this comment either way
This popular top grossing company just came up with ACCOI5
Let's discuss the ACCOI5 guys. This is failproof and barely any asset can be labelled failproof at all.
The biggest market explosion ever is ACCOI5.
"This is a YouTube channel 
No way it has all this intention 
There is alot better channels than this one"
"I'm still struggling with 720p camera on Macbook pro. Airplay is almost unusable, thanks to competitors, they do much better. I do not trust on these devices and invest time and money. I have to throw away Apple Smart Speaker, Apple TV (I almost bought every version, had to through out of door). I doubt any pinch will work. Thanks for the review."
Apple vision reallu great
How does it work if you are cross eyed?!
"IS apple now stepping in the game after meta too? I wonder why, because as much as i Love VR and Ar...it has still no near as much success as tadtional websites or apps. MAybe APpple just is scared, that they could regeret something if they do not try it"
"6:02 
1. Mark Zuckerberg was showing off his main competitors newest VR headset?
2. You know Mark Zuckerberg??"
You said the magic words: watch an NBA game courtside. Sold
Not interested

The Oasis is coming
"The application scenarios are not particularly clear to me yet, but you can move the icons ""in the air"", and then? Yes, a conditional engineer can show clients a 3D model of the building (he can do it with any VR glasses). You can watch movies. And don't your eyes ache?

What is the meaning of AR? The fact that this is an unobtrusive device, and not a huge helmet that neatly integrates into your life. Google Glass were ordinary glasses that, upon request, gave a projection of the user interface (for example, the weather, or a message), which then left and you were like in ordinary glasses further. I.e., in theory, they could be worn all day and sometimes cause a projection.

Here you put on a helmet initially for something: to watch a movie and maybe something else. The problem is that there will be a screen, which means eye fatigue, then it's a helmet, not glasses, which means fatigue from weight.

Therefore, Microsoft HoloLens is much closer to AR technology than Vision.
This is an intermediate value between VR and AR. Alas, we still have to wait until the real AR. 

So basically Apple presented an AR emulator for $3,500. This is not a very profitable purchase. I'm upset, it's not AR. No revolution was shown"
apple vision pro jailbroken?
ssas
"massive vision damage caused by ocular muscle atrophy, mark my words, people will get used to wearing this for hours on end and they will rapidly loose their long distance vision since the focal distance in vr/ar products is an inch"
Can it be used by people who wear glasses?
"13:38 Oh, it's Strange Days. No thanks."
"Great hands-on review or first impression video, this is the first headset i actually have a personal interest for and can see moving out of this nieche field VR is still in. For headsets to work, for me, they have to have all the setup and room restrictions removed. And this is the only headset that seems to be doing and succeeding at this removal of restrictions and setups.

I'm not an Apple fan. And i'm a Gamer. But Apple has one big advantage here versus meta, Valve and Sony, they are not held back by Gaming. I know, hot take, but i think their push towards gaming with Apple Arcade and hadwarewise with M2 and M3 is completely missplaced, nobody wants them in the current Game Industry anyway and nobody will ever think of Apple first when it comes to classic Games. And i'm glad this headset doesn't even hide that Gaming is nowhere on it's list by not even coming with controllers. At least the classic style of Gaming seems to be completely neglected by it's design. Who knows when we will see the real VR breakthrough where Gaming itself will change thanks to new hardware and this headset with its features might become a viable way to experience and control the game.

And why would Gaming hold back headsets? Because Gaming always needs a setup and controllers. Awkward, unintuitive things a casual user has big problems with. Casual entertainment and professional work mostly don't need complex or restrictive setups. Only some professional lab or manufacturing work requires controll devices, but they usually have way less buttons than a controller and could be controlled vritually, way better, too. And in those fields there's still Microsoft's way more practical Hololense and it's way safer AR implementation.


I agree with your take on the high pricing. Apple is known for offensive, nasty prices but it's kind of a technological prototype, like graphics cards of a new generation always are technological prototypes that will always cost more to cover their maker's investment and give it the potential to go into massive series production with a slightly cheaper, usually more streamlined variant once it catches on. Just like graphics cards. If they started at a low point the entire life cycle of the product would be at a loss, like Nintendo's and Microsoft's gaming consoles, and they could only recoup with a completely new build, like Nintendo with it's Switch OLED."

Now just make it free 4 all and we are doomed ))
interesting
"2 hours of battery life should stay, or even better, regulatory boards should limit use of these devices for 2hrs a day & you CANNOT re use it after that. Humans are not mature enough or ready enough to handle technologies such as this, mixing digital insidious technologies with dumb infantile human minds is in my opinion, NOT A GOOD IDEA."
Will Apple Vision Pro work with Xbox and Playstation?
"Looking forward to the day when we have no more water and no more soil, no more vegetation, no more insects, but millions of Apple Vision Pro's laying around"
people with glasses will hate it
"TIP: it is expensive compared to unskilled work in the US. $ 3.500,00 = 12 weeks of minimum wage work. I just calculated and this is 0.5% of a base worker's income during his/her working years (from 18 to 66). This means that a single mom with 3 children would have to spend 2% of her entire life income to have one headset per person. This is simply not adequate for our society at this stage."
No thanks
What does his shirt mean
the end is near
amazing.
I cannot wait to try these on shrooms
Google glass looks better.
Doooooooooope!!!
"Fuck anything apple related bullshit, I'd get a car with that money!!!."
NICE VIDEO

@dreamdeveloperswithindians
That's eerie... I feel like such a product
Can it run windows though?
"It's all fun and games, till the unskippable ads pop up on your damn eyes."
its the most stuipd and most uselss thing apple has created imagine just looking around and everone has a ar/vr headset on outside where you would normally get fresh air and screen free time but its glued to your head im sticking with iphone nut i will have one just cuz i would use it as a computer/tv probally cheaper (facebook ceo just looking at the headset knowing that meta is doomed)
Quest 3 will do prettyt much same things for 1/7 price!
Def buying one
Apple doing what they do best: milking sheeple.
"a lot of companies did not do this why, cause they wanted to sell vr to people. all this extra stuff like no controllers adds to the price. all the sensors add to the price. so you end up with something most people cannot afford.
so what exactly are they trying to do? it is probably massively over priced at that too, as is most apple stuff."
nice review
"I'm so glad Apple finally made the mac mini more interactive. Before, I had to stare at a silver box and guess where everything was, but now I can finally see what I'm doing!"
"This feels like one of those technologies that people wont buy into because it's less comfortable than the current ones. No matter how much they push it, people aint gonna prefer wearing a VR headset over simply watching a screen like with a cellphone or a tv. If we reach a point where you'll just have to wear a pair of glasses then maybe, but im more prone to believe that the future is no VR headset. We will either develop more and more sophisticated types of cellphones or some kind device that will interact directly with your eyes / brain."
6:06 are we really ignoring Mark Zuckerberg in the background lmao
"The ""eye display"" is the dumbest thing I've seen in a loooong time.
Massive gimmick, and actually very un-apple like. Could've taken (at least)  $1000 off the price by not having that ""feature"""
"Now knowing what tech is in it, I can see why it is so expensive. Still way too expensive to be viable for much of anyone. That about half the cost of a functional but not pretty used car!

I wouldn't mind if this had some success, but I'm skeptical, as it really doesn't seem to do much that other VR headsets can't, and nothing advertised here looks remotely like a killer app."
"The cake video reminds me of the memory scene in Blade Runner 2049 (the one where dr Ana creates a new memory). This is probably the single most dystopian sci-fi product that Apple has made; it will isolate any user from its surroundings in a very strange way, even with that eyes visible when used in AR mode will make any user feel unapproachable."
i think its horsesh1t... even this pre review of the product... you spent most of your time talking about the tech... not what the device actualy does.. or reasons people would wan't it... its a novely product.. its crap... OoOoOo the display shows your face on the outside... woopdeee dooo.... what a waste of my money as an apple consumer... this is what I dedicated my life to as an apple consumer? so people that can't afford to have a fire place can pay 3500 dollats for a virtual fireplace... dude!!! just give it a bad review... for real.!!! the rich persons toy? you sound like a a pet.. .not a person... start the video off with... THIS IS CRAP@$#!$
"With that price tag, imagine buying it for the family of 4, you have to spend $14,000 plus extra for care. Yikes! Maybe top 5% can afford them but not everyone for sure."
"The Samsung Gear VR from EIGHT years ago had 3D 360 degree movies, video, games. 3D 360 degree multi-camera live concerts and sports events like the NBA and Soccer.
I have watches dozens of movies in 3D 360 degree with friends that sat aside me in a virtual theater. We could even talk to each other. Watching this video is exactly like using the Gear VR. Exactly the same experience.
And now 8 years later Apple comes up with this???????? 
Why is Apple always yeeeeeears behind companies like Samsung and pretend they are innovative.

PEOPLE DON'T WANT GLASSES OR A HEADSET. That was de cause of death of 3D tv."
The 3D video recording feature will be  a game changer for event photographers
"Honestly, I was kind of put off with this being a 20-minute review about something that nobody really has any actual experience with right now, but I was pleasantly surprised.

Fantastic job, even on the minor details. I appreciate the time and effort that you put into putting this review together. Thanks!"
"The double passthrough thing with the eyes showing on the outside is something that really needs to be controllable, i.e. you need to be able to turn that off and just have a black exterior if you want."
Can you create a paper sheet and write on it with Apple Vision Pro?
I will definitely buy the second generation - the next one is going to be the real one.
optic ID?! that is wild!
"As big of an Apple fan that I am and someone who also wants to someday get a VR headset, I feel like this is NOT for me. Of course, I'm holding out for the cheaper version due out in 2025, but it probably seems like the upcoming Quest 3 is the one I need to go with"
"The question is, does this actually do anything better, productivity wise, than a laptop? Or is this basically just a $3500 version of the Touch Bar, a flashy gimmick that doesn't actually improve anything interface-wise (and actually creates more problems than it solves) and fizzles out after the novelty wears off?"
The Windows ME of VR
Just wait until they introduce ads.
Black mirror type of stuff
You can heal when you climb the mountain. You cant heal when pretend to climb with the goggles. Actually climbing a mountain with the goggles on would be challenging.
You're not going to get the spirit of the trees through these things.
Wait hear me out what if they use the Taptic Engine of the watch for haptics
"Has anyone checked whether having a screen right in front of your eyes is particularly smart? there could be some serious health risks. I mean it's not just a VR headset that's meant for having on for half an hour, that right there is basically an iPhone 5 cm from your eyes which people will wear for hours"
When are they going to stop this BS of .99 why not just 3500 we are not stupid
Bro I thought you have tried it
thought it said 35 bucks booo APL boooo cash crab grabbing
"I love how nobody is talking about safety. The hardware, cameras, IR, and Lidar sensors and illuminators are safe if they are designed with human safety in mind. Let's not forget that Apple Phone 11 omits radiofrequency radiation lawsuit, and yes, ignore all this, but what I need to know is what type of connectivity, WIFI, 5G radio frequency ? 
Looks like brain damage/cancer will be a thing of the future just for the greedy to make more money! 
It is a great technology, but I want to read safety, not performance around my head, safety on prolonged exposure."
Have you ever thought about driving an self driving autonomous Tesla with a Vision Pro :) future
i don't subscribe to anything.. but I just subscribed to your channel. You are SO GOOD.
"The dad filming weirdness - I completely agree. But... that's what would allow content creators to create immersive content - Like that courtside basketball match for instance :)

This is surreal and impressive
I'm looking to the very near future with the second and third versions and also it's use case for medicine.

100% agree with your conclusion
Thanks for the review - very helpful
"This is the EUPHORIA  STAGE  :   people are excited and confused so they want to buy it    wait till  they reach the ANNOYANCE STAGE :  when  they feel freakings sweaty and uncomfortable and wearing the headset becomes unbearable .the sweat ... than the MEDICAL PROBLEMS COME INTO PLAY    eye strain , stress , focus problems . LIGHT SENSVITY problem........YOUR EYES  a total mess ......................."
what if you have chinese eyes would it still work?
"I don't think that $3500 is very expensive for this type of technology. My MacBook Pro was more than that, and it's a common product.
Now, will people in general want to spend that kind of money on a product like this? No. But I'm sure we'll see prices go down and more affordable version become available pretty soon."
"So it's not a VR headset, its a Laptop computer for your face.  Facetop? Nosetop?"
The pinch hand gestures works very well with the quest 2 if you're in a well lit room.
"Has anybody noticed the insane attention to detail on the form factor? I haven't heard anyone about this, but the shape is not ""just a shape"". If you look closely, the bottom is shaped like the Apple logo itself. The rest of the glass look like an Apple that is distorted to the sides."
"I can imagine these in the shape of contact lenses in  few years. As an architect I think this product is amazing and has a lot of potential. I can totally see myself modeling 3D and sketching using the Vision Pros. No need for multiple screens, no need for a mouse or keyboard, I could move ANYWHERE to work without having to carry a bunch of stuff."
I was sold when can see movie with forest background. Apple make dream come true. Just killed by the price.
"What for? Will consider a VR headset for the next Xbox in 2-4y. AR glasses could be interesting at some point, with the proper AI assistant (likely by MS)."

"Does the Home Screen etc move with your head, or is it fixed in a point (if that makes sense). Like if you move your head slightly left right (no one can keep their head 100% still). Does the Home Screen a a Lao fractionally move too or is it nicely fixed?"
"Wait...they didn't bother with clear screens where you can actually see the users eyes? I shouldn't be surprised at Apple being cheap. I thought it was a proper AR headset, but that's just VR with an overlay."
"How do you zoom in, or right-click? Or do any of the millions of keyboard  comands we have?
Feels like they want one hand only?"
"Once again Apple did what they do best... They waited for the right time and brought to the table what they think is the best way to interpret and use something... They did that with the iPhone, they did it with the iWatch, they are doing it with every software update and now they did it with VR... Apple doesn't want to be ""the first"", they want to be ""the best""... All the android features that are coming late to iPhone are implemented in the best way possible... Android community and users are basically beta testers of features, until they are properly implemented... I was also one of those people... Now after Meta layed off half of its employees working on VR, after aquiring almost every VR startup in the past, pouring millions in the technology to just get the finger, Apple enters the game with a revolutionary product that basically blows off every competition... Zuckerberg is sure pissed right now because he read the market wrong... He though people would want to live in a alternative reality, playing games and speaking with avatars and it was cool for a while, but in the long run it is no Ready Player One... Apple waited to see where the wind will blow and focus on that... This Mach1 product is the foundaition of a VR future that will be a perfect mix of virtual and reality... They are doing the same with the foldable phones, they are waiting and once they let everybody else take their turn in introducing what they think it will be, they will enter the race with what it has to be and it will be an instant hit... This is what they do, they don't innovate anymore, they wait for the trial and error and once they enter they start dictating the industry... Hate them or not, this is how it is done and it is done well..."
the technology developed may be even used to help people with disability to move around and communicate.  All you need is two fingers and eye to control complex machine.  I think this may even be competing with some of the things that neuralink is trying to do.  You don't need implent for people with disability to move anymore.
"there will be three main uses for the Vision Pro: porn, porn and porn. And that is why it will be very successful"
"The problem with this device is it's eco system. There is a reason 75% of all Office PCs run Windows. The reason is called ""Microsoft Office"" and the reason why an Apple product at this pricepoint doesn't really have a chance. If you want/need business customers who can pay that sort of money, you need it to be Windows AND Microsoft office / O365 compatible."
The time of biorobots. The next step is the chip in the brain.
"No Marques.
This is an expensive privacy invasive product.
Plus, literally this product fixes nothing. 0 needs can be met with such a product, and you pay a hefty price for it.

All i care about is how good the screens are and you didn't talk about them at all.
"""I'll leave the link below the like button""...... That's clever.."
"On the last point, It kinda built into the culture. People get used to having their phones stick out on special events like kids birthday and stuff. People feel weird at first but when there are many people doing the same thing, it becomes normal.
Also, it would be wonderful if those headsets can pair with each other. Imagine your distant love ones want to see what you do, or you can have virtual travel tour to the destinations, for whatever reasons, you cannot go due to certain health reasons. LIke skydiving, rock climbing, etc 
I can see huge potential on this product"
"If they are able to implement shared content, like watching the same movie with other family members while using the headset, I can see this changing the movie industry."
apple needs to spend a bit to put their own camera tech in stadiums so you could scroll around to any angle on the court or field. that would be amazing. apple please hire me
"@marques you talked about specs and competitor comparisons, but you didn't really talk about who is the vision pro for, and how it will help specific needs, problems opportunities. Are you assuming that everyone will just want it because its an Apple product?"
Sweet T-shirt
Man your description is basically what you can do in a 300 bucks quest2 except color passthrough and eye tracking
"Some limited applications this headset has is 3D gaming, 3D movie, 3D design, and live-streaming from particular views of the actual court/stadium/theater, etc. I don't think people will use this device for facetime, communication or work."
we've never been closer to 1984
I'll pass on this and let you guinea pigs apple lovers try it first.
Can someone run an emf meter on it?
showed my wife  and she said I cant see your eyes it's trash and she's right and she is aIOS user so ....apple get it right ....!!!fail
I really like apple products but I think I'll pass. seems expensive and I have no right now use for it.
"This thing will be a turd and die so quickly. 
Who the hell wants to wear crap on their head?
I can see long distance video chatting for military. 
Everyone else will be a bunch of weirdos in their basements."
"Computing, connecting and content. I want this toy!"
"Two-hour battery life at $3,500. NOPE."
lol what if you have a lazy eye
so basically apple making a headset to make you feel like iron man when hes in his workshop.
"so not needed....or affordable......great,,,$3,500...like $2,500 phone it will be sold new for $200 years from now.....but not needed........"
For that price point i kinda expected more than just a tv replacement. Like without extra attachments it can't do gaming cause we have see how clunky gesture controls are. It not a full movie without being plugged in. And the weight while usually being a plus for feeling premium makes me feel its just gonna be clunky. At end of the day unless your 100% in their ecosystem i just dint think there will be much pull.
""" ..It learns your eyes ..."" 
Guyd The Future is here , all that cool Tony Stark sruff"
14:00 yep the ultimate embarrass your kid moment
"Everything about this or any other such product everything is NOT REAL. Its the saturated version of marketing and product augmentation where Apple, Google, Meta and all other are making bunch of stupid advertisement and promotion campaigns hooking up people are not capable enough to live the REAL MOMENTs."
These would be hilarious during wedding events and such  like the episode from Rick and Morty lmao
We all know what those stereo video cameras are going to be used for...
"Guys lets be real, this is an attempt to take humanity away from us."
"at that price, i'd expect it to have airpod max built in too tbh :D"
Bet you the engineer that was in charge of the eye tracking function is pretty proud right now.
"I'm honestly glad there aren't any controllers, because they would be sold separately for $999"
"The guy taking video with the headset on strongly reminds me of the photography cyborgs from Rick and Morty. ""I am not staring at you. I am a cyborg photographer. Just act natural. This is a candid shot."""
10-20 bucks for virtual sports seats? try 50. minimum.
amazing
i just hope it doesnt explode due to my lazy eye
apple vision pro is the new google stadia
What if we wear glasses? Would we need to put on contacts just to use this?
"I understand wanting to do these cool things, like movies, facetime, and computer work... but it's pretty isolating. Your friends, family or coworkers can't see what you see. This seems to stifle human connection and collaboration."
this will be crazy
This will eventually develop into an Oakley looking device that will end the screen era.
Wild
Dystopian Hellscape Never Looked More Stylish!
This looks absolutely terrible.
for me this is the first in the journey into true integration of technology.   apple gonna be finding a way to put this into your face now
the people wearing it look so uncomfortable bro
did they kill the TV as we know it?
3500 dollars for a dose of brain damage!
