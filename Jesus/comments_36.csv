"THE FOOD BANK FOOD MADE ME SICK WITH GONE OFF THINGS NOT FRESH, AND ALL THE TINS IS BAD FOR ME. LIVER ,KIDNEY AND HEART ATTACK IN THE LAST 3 YEARS AND 6 MONTHS. I GET EXTRA HELP WITH THE BILLS AND BUY THE FOOD FROM THE LOCAL TESCO SHOPPING CENTRE. I GET MY SON AND DAUGHTER TO BUY THE WATER BOTTLES AND TOILETRIES FROM THE LOCAL COSCO. GOD BLESS FROM GLADYS IN EAST LONDON."
This is absolutely heartbreaking - living in the United States of America and going hungry.
"Dumb USA, why not make sure that people has wages, and working conditions so they can pay for their own food . And look at people driving up in their huge gas guzzling SUV's that they don't own , and can't pay for. Talk about being utterly stupid"
"Politicians love stirring up culture war nonsense, attacking reproductive health rights, racial tensions etc. but jobs, housing, healthcare, food and leisure are all that people need. Vote for politicians that talk about what matters, especially food! not manufactured controversy"
Funny that they queue up in their recent model vehicles.
"So they can afford all those expensive cars, but they can't buy a meal for the day?"
"The idiots don't understand that all that cash the government printed new and gave away for free during the pandemic, that is what is causing the inflation and higher prices today."
These people got cars and yet got no food? What the hell?
when silent quitting backfires
And this is also China's fault.
There we go sent billions of your tax money to Ukraine   and you people line up for the scraps welcome to the new USA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
what about all those unfilled jobs ?
"I guess I'm rich I'm able to eat out everyday I never cook but that's also because I don't have kids I don't have credit card debt no pets I live a comfortable relaxing life and for me covid made me alot of money I have a mobile auto detailing business here in Palm Beach County, FL I did exactly what large corporations do I jacked up my prices and claimed a covid cleaning service which was BS"
"one question why get children, if your in this position?"
I am glad to see fruits and veg for these people who need every bit of the help they can get.
"And they look like the type to vote for the exact people who put them in that position... They look like the type to eat facebook propaganda for breakfast, get into conspiracy theories and say sh*t like bIdEn EcOnOmY.

America truly died in 2016."
I was getting $130.  Now I get $23.
"This is the consequence and outcome of former Treasury Secretary Ben Bernanke's ""quantitative-easing"" since 2008 and will only worsen!"
"Greatest country in the world, right? Love from Australia."
People have time to sit six hours in a line. How about spending six hours working or looking for work? How about selling the vehicle (many people have SUVs or trucks) and using the money you save to pay for the necessities of life?
If we stopped taking care of illegals and looked after OUR OWN.
"Yep and as the top comment said, these the same people that vote Republican EVERY TIME then get shocked when they get screwed over by the people they vote for.   The sad thing is that they will continue to f themselves over and their own egos and peer pressure will never allow them to vote say Democrat as Republicans continue to throw up barriers to their own working poor voters."
Folks need to get off their tales and work.
NO one would be like this if they worked.  If you have nothing it is because you are not earning anything.   How do you own a damn car yet you need someone else to provide food for you?  The problem is NOT society it is the people.   Those who want others to work for them while they take handouts.  How is  it helping if the problem gets worse and worse?  Your solution is a failure yet you keep going with your solution.    These people cant feed themselves yet they can have a baby?    These humans made choices and now they pay the  price.  It is sad but predictable.
"interesting, when I live in USSR , they said Capitalism didnt have breadlines?"
"What a joke, US politicians are wealthy, and the sheep who keep electing them are screwed, snap out of it sheep, you must like being controlled by the 2 party dictatorship of the Republicans and Democrats"
Biden's America.
The horrible part is economists have proven that all the inflation is caused by corporate greed. Lazy shareholders lay around and collect checks while the people suffer
"Are not the republican mantra that you should stand up for your self, and not look at socialism? why are these people getting socialism and they do not decry it? Yet they will vote for the same people making them hungry"
Why do a lot of people collecting food benefits in that line drive a large truck or SUV?
Get woke. Go broke.
I bet if you go in these people houses you will see a lot of junk that they are buying.
"yes east kentucky is in trouble, you cant get a living wage here"
Respect to the volunteers
I love what she said...Jesus didn't look in your fridge before He fed you. He just fed you. God bless her. She truly has a heart for helping people.
Amazing work that they're doing and amazing reporting!
What COVID benefits other than the stimulus checks?  What ended I missed?
"""FREE"", always runs out."
"I have been to your country so many times, the financial & tech world look fancy. I can't imagine in the same country, so many people are not getting food. I always thought inequality is our (third world's) problem."
"God bless these people.  It's because of the faltering lack of Morals, Traditions, and Religion that we don't care and are so focused on GREED.  THIS is what you support in Government.  NOT THE 1% and the Insider Trading.
HOW DO CONGRESSMAN HAVE MILLION DOLLAR PAYCHECKS?!?!?!  tHEY WORK FOR THE PEOPLE!!!!"
Don't worry they just passed a bill to take the rest of your snap away. But the good news is now you can find more work to survive.
That one guy looks like he's not missing too many meals. Then again hunger effects everyone.
"COVID was one big psyop.  It produced more people who expect handouts and in turn, you vote for the political party who gives you the table scraps."
They took the loot and ran....that food was to temp you into thinking they cared and to take the precious....
Ugh!!! And I don't get why these same white folks are blaming foreigners who can work their way out of 3rd world poverty for the problems of this country when they're the majority population and they can't find their way out of their 1st world complaints.
"I am seeing a lot of modern, valuable cars in that line and some huge gas guzzling trucks. I get SNAP benefits and my car is 24 years old. Interesting that they are so broke they can't buy food but they can afford there car payment's on there nice new cars. I saw a few cars in there that you would expect of low income people but the majority look like newer cars and huge trucks and SUVs that guzzle expensive gas. 
Some need it but there will always be people willing to take advantage of free food even if they already have money."
"Where are the father's of these 4 boys, and why are they not helping to feed their children?"
This is so sad! How can this happen in this country? This just should not be!
I'd bet 80-90% of the folks receiving FREE FOOD from these pantries would say socialism is the devil... right after accepting free groceries

Maybe the creeps that used them in restuarants will stop going.  Always the EBT peeps harrassing people in restaurants.
"When the Tories destroyed the mining towns in the north of the UK under Thatcher many towns ended up with 100% unemployment. A lot of miners took to bartering and basically towns abandoned the use of money. You swapped work, skills and goods with your neighbors and friends. Not a perfect solution but it really helped."
"Ready made cakes?  They should just give out flour, sugar, salt, rice, beans etc.  Did Americans forget how to bake bread and cakes?"
The most obvious solution to this issue would be send another $100 Billion in weapons to Ukraine.
"I'm so sick of poor people.  My broke ass neighbor collects welfare and food stamps, drives a nice Lexus, has nice clothes, and doesn't pay her section 8 rent on time."
"The money was always meant to be temporary.

Poor choices in life have consequences."
Why are we sending Billlllions overseas while our own citizens are struggling?
Lmao about time these lazy people can go back to work
And our govt should do more for us instead of squandering our tax dollars housing annnd feeding illegals!
Swamped with people who don't want t get jobs!!!
"As long as the US military complex gets the funds it needs
in order to conduct useless wars all over the globe,
I think all is fine and dandy in the richest nation in this galaxy."
And yet billions of dollars are sent to Ukraine!!
Grew up in a high poverty area myself.  I knew I had to get out.  Joined the military.  Had them put me through school.  Got out and finished my degree.  Got married.  Had kids.  And now I have a great job in a nice city and I help everybody else instead of the other way around.  Haven't been back home in decades.  Never going back.  Poverty is a mindset.  Get the hell out and don't look back.
"Murica, hell yeah! Greatest country on earth? honestly this makes me just sad. how come every country, not only USA, has always enough money for weapons, military and useless over-the-top-funded banks and stuff, but never even 1 dime for their own people?"
Do they offer education on how to stay in budget..use coupons..grow a small garden..how to get out of the poverty cycle?
"Everytime I see video of these kinds of people interviewed they're fat and in late model cars. That one obese guy had a Carhartt shirt on, those are like $20 each for a t-shirt, probably more for 6XL"
"the snap benefits didn't keep people out of poverty, you have to be IN poverty to qualify for snap. they kept people from going hungry who are in poverty, but they didn't keep people out of poverty. bad reporting."
Thank you for helping these wonderful people. Bless you.
"but we can find money to send to
israel, ukraine and saudi arabia . this needs to stop, charity starts at home"
"In a ""Christian"" country with so much to offer that things constantly go to waste, this shouldn't be happening..."
"This is so heartbreaking...in the ""richest county in the world""!"
But they vote for people that make and support the cuts smh
I don't care...as my favorite politician has millions then I'm cool
Covid was 3 years ago buddy
"Less money to Jesus, Trump and the NRA might help."
"There are two adults in this video who appear to be of normal weight:  Guy in red at 1:06 and 4:23, and the guy in purple at 2:48.

I volunteer at a food bank twice a month.  Same thing:  overweight people, many in cars nicer than mine, waiting in line for free food."
"And some people have billions 
Kinda fucked"
"I wish Vice had asked the question.....""Who did you vote for?""  And I am more than willing to bet it was for the Republican Party.  A party that does not care about them one bit, but can easily count on their vote.  If they voted Republican....then they got what they deserved.  My money is going down the drain."
Used to get $250 now I get $23 a month lmao
I dont understand how they struggle with all that bigly republican leadership they always vote in!
Hard to feel too sorry for people that consistently vote against their own best interests.
It's really going to be tough now with all the people that are coming illegally. The food that is available will probably go to them first. IJS.
Everyone is back to work.
"They should network with supermarkets and resturants to get food that is past date, or extras during closing time."
"I'm just glad they're giving out real food. Meat potatoes, carrots. Not junk."
Poor and uneducated continue to vote for the same political party.
You voted for it. Guess you need a job.
And more Migrants are coming in taking away even more benefits.....
And to think 40% of all food made in America gets THROWN AWAY. I was in one grocery store and I saw them scanning out veggies and throwing them in the trash! They were fine. Walgreens throws food away that's a month away from expiring!!! And there's so many horror stories of food waste. I work at a food bank and make sure everyone gets food. It's better to go to a small food bank. No one waits for hours just to be seen.
And YET every business is short staffed. Ppl do not want to work.
"Obviously stop voting those types in
They will drag our country into the ground and happy spend them money on themselves"
Foodbanks is a blessing for people that  really need food  I have seen people standing in line that don't need it they are taking it away from people that really need it here in vallejo ca Phillipines are abusing it they are greedy
Maybe if you showed up that early for a job!!!
They pay for 300$ a night hotels for immigrants but take 95$ a month away from Americans. Don't make any sense
these women have all these kids for no reason but because they met a guy for a few months
"The government is subsidizing the the wrong crops, instead of subsidizing corn and wheat they need to subsidize fruits and vegetables."
"i got tired of repeating this process, at some point i got a grow tent, light, and some other things to help me understand the grow and regrow food process, and been able to grow a tiny bit of food."
"I understand the old lady, no excuse for young people not getting a job."
you'd think america government would be able to help all americans in need even homeless people but they dont everyone should be living good
Biden2024 let's get trillion to ukrane
"Real hard American moment. Keep voting against helping people, but then seeking help. Hope your F150 keeps you and your family fed.
While you're two states away in a red cap, your mom is here just trying to eat. Shame."
That's a LONG line .
There are a lot of nice vehicles in the line
More then half those vehicles were 10x nicer then mine I work full time and barely afford anything since covid but we always have money to fund a useless war thats been going on way way to long and ive lost friends over there! Thanks government great job
This is so funny the US warmonger can't feed it people instead they invest heavy on military then they want to compared themselves with china and Russia this is so ridiculous
Just a shame people can't get food regularly. This and food deserts are disgusting. No one should have to schlep 2 hrs in one direction to get food to feed their families.
I saw lots of Youtubers who are dumpsters diving so much food..
Maybe cut military budget for war.
Coming to receive food .... in a late model Ford F-150 and Dodge Ram.
"I am sure their GOP Governor,senators and congressmen they keep voting for are trickling down their money to help them."
This is intentional. Thank the government.
"As long America can Finance war in other countys and build 13 Billion Aircraft Carrier and pay 200 Million Dollar for one F35, there is no problem."
Make sure we take care of Ukraine first.
All the Vice employees gonna be going there soon
"I didn't even realize people were STILL getting ""Covid Benefits"" in 2023!?? Good News- there are PLENTY of open jobs out there."
"This is the richest country in the world... Christ, when you see things like this, there is a systemic underlying problem."
Stop immigration stop immigration stop immigration. Hey there you go I gave you three good ideas
Need the food pantry and help to feed your children but you still get your goddamn f****** nails done.
Jobs are everywhere
My daughter taught and was a single mom. She relied on food banks.  Many people are employed and do not make enough money to get by.  Hyperinflation and a depression are coming. Many children are going to be hungry.
look at the poorest states and they all vote for people who cut those benefits..... amazing
"Thyre supposedly broke, but half of them are driving huge gas guzlers SMH"
Spend trillions of dollars fighting wars in other countries but dont have millions to feed your own people ..wow Murican politicians are great
"Jesus never looked in your fridge before he fed you.
What a beautiful person."
Disabled people are expected to feed themselves on 100$ a month.If they are lucky they receive this amount
"People will likely continue to make excuses for the actions of billionaires, hoping one day they will be of the same wealth, will waiting in lines like these."
"If you're able to, please participate or volunteer at your local food bank! When I was receiving food at the local pantry, I was returning the favor by volunteering for one day a week, and if I missed a day, they would struggle a lot, since not many people volunteered. Lots of heavy lifting, stocking cans, cleaning fridges, organizing, and stacking boxes. Nothing I couldn't handle, but having more people on hand would help a lot."
i see it as its just easier to not eat. skip meals. dont eat
In kentucky where Biden and Obama killed the use of coal! Hmm!! I wonder why they have no jobs or money! Duh! Climate change is killing us all
Hey Kentucky!!! You keep voting for Mitch McConnell what do you expect??!! YOU GET WHAT YOU VOTE FOR!!!
Many of the cars in the line are well over $30K. Awesome!
"Eight hours of burning up gas what about the people who don't have gas money, dont have a car."
And people keep reelecting the same governor over and over. I just don't get it.
"I for one don't have a car anymore, I stopped driving after it was confirmed I have MS."
It's truly disheartening that one of the few times a large chunk of the population felt economically secure was during a global pandemic.
The State of the most powerful Republican senator and look how the people are treated? Ending the benefits last spring was cruel considering the state's economy. I'm sure McConnell could care less.
"COVID benefits should have ended over a year ago... Why were these bums still claiming benefits? Lazy people.. Unless you are over 60 years old, get back to Fkn work or get a job like the rest of us."
Yet there are so many unfilled jobs. Just saying there must be a connection there.
"This kind of reporting is probably 1 of the best things Vice does, compared to a lot of other news organizations. 
Too bad they had to file for bankruptcy, themselves."
"I just don't know what to say. The US has all the Dollars it wants, just print more if it runs out yet it's going to Ukraine and the military! 
Priorities?"
But lets feed the migrants and send money to Ukraine.  Help America first.
eat the dog so i can pay rent thx brandon
WE need to vote differently.
Welcome to the wealthiest country on earth.
Politicians failing America!
"It didn't keep anyone from poverty, it only kept food on everyone's table. Many Americans were already living in poverty and didn't know or won't accept it. If you make minimum wage you ARE living in poverty in America."
"I had 30lbs of food delivered to my door everyweek, what ever I didn't use I gave it to my neighbors, that didn't have cars,I was helping anyone that wanted it and I did that for 3 years"
Omg get a job. There are so many jobs available
Those stimulus checks that trump and Biden issued only helped to cause pricing issues with food and services.
I live on food banks and commodities food
It is heart breaking to see these scenes in the richest country of the world
I don't even feel bad for these people any more because they vote against themselves.
Lol this is America from the inside looking in. Good karma for the sins
This is what happens when government took so much care of people
where are the Fathers of the poor kids??
"Kentucky. 75% of these people vote for politicians whose goal is to cut ALL subsidies to the poor, when they're not obsessing over banning books, drag shows & healthcare for women & trans people. Unbelievable!"
And yet these idiots continue to vote for republicans. You reap what you sew people.
"In 2022 this country spent, $2,297 (6.3 billion a day) billion of taxpayer monies spent on the military. This is what the richest country in the world, and the richest country in history, does with our money."
"The government is responsible for all of our wose they're the one's  who are irresponsible and spending our taxes on stupid things like billions sent to Ukraine, illegal immigrants and their own pockets"
Seniors are the most affected. Our country fails our elderly population every day.
Poverty is a policy choice. It can be easily solved.
Farmers are needed here.
The democrats did these cuts .
"Most people live like God in France, yet when it comes down to buying food, then they have to save money or go to foodbanks."
Vote Blue and they will continue to Screw You.
"Here in El Paso, Texas many Mexicans take the donations to sell in their mom and pop stores."
"At the risk of sounding like an @$$ . . . 




Where does personal responsibility come into play?  It's not like companies aren't hiring or like Cousin Eddy, are they holding out for management positions?"
Ukraine gets billions in military aid and the poorest Americans get their benefits cut. What a shame.
Of course- they need to keep that money to feed the illegals coming to the USA.
How many of these people don't have a job or are of SS age? They are abusing the government's hand out. SNAP and EBT aren't supposed to be forever. The only ones who should use them are people that are disabled.
So sad watching these videos with the American people suffering  like this. While  the president has are boarders open  what is going to happen when all these people come here. It just going to get worse for Americans
"if Americans we in Africa depending on the government in crisis time they'd all be extinct in my part of Africa Kenya the people who were given donations from UN, USAID, china etc they stole all the money I mean all of it even kits and vaccines"
Teach people to be lazy and this is what happens.
"Let me guess, they all vote Republican and will continue doing so."
"If you are in need and you want to save your family, it's time to vote for the most progressive democratic party member who has a chance of winning at the next election.
Enough of the Magat Repub Christo fascist protectors of billionaires. You need to survive!"
"No no kidding. Food prices have went up and any help is eliminated.
Ben and Jerry's 3 years ago was only $3 and some change.
Now it's double."
"A lot of these people, NOT all should go to Florida. Tons of jobs available!"
"Most people I know talk from time-to-time about an upcoming economic collapse.  If, this occurs, what will these people do?  Starve?"
And here we're having all these migrants coming over that have to eat.... this is just so disgusting!!!!
It is really weird that people lived in Appalachia for hundreds of years without free food.
"I get SNAP benefits and its hard to feel bad for that guy in the probably $30,000-$45,000 truck complaining he is only getting $58 a month. I don't have a car and maybe he should sell his truck and get something a little more affordable if he needs to use the government for help. Sorry if this sounds harsh but there are people that actually need help and I'm at a loss of words. I can understand that guy in the rusted out car and he may need the help. Just my opinion"
"It's real. Once again, I am reminded how blessed and fortunate I am."
This is terrible but I bet most of these people vote for the very people that are screwing them.
Most people sell their food stamps for 50 cents on the dollar. It benefits people who can actually afford food and is a supplemental income for drug addicts.
we need bombs for wars soo sorry.
Bless her heart she's a very sweet lil girl you can see she really wants to help everyone some of these food banks the people who work there give everything to there friends and themselves and that's not right  but no one is monitoring them this young girl deserves a metal for helping and being honest  she's a sweetheart
Hear me out getting rid of your gigantic car and get a simpler one can save you tons of cost for food.
"These people should go to the boarder come back illegally and they will get better treat 
Everything is paid for"
Food went up more than even the help could cover. Then take that away and it just doesn't last.
how much did the Biden admin. donate to Ukraine again?
"""We wasted more money on the gas waiting than we would've spent on food"""
They cut my extra 300 i thought it wasnt going effct me at all sh1t i thought i was spoiled i was getting extra treats for myself and my kids but now they cut it and went shopping and its not like im buying top shelf stuff but damn food is so expensive that the prices for the cheap brand is 3 times more expensive i live In CA and make 21 an hour i make 738 a week 3 kids my girl doesn't work babysitting is expensive kids are small under 5 years old have a new car had too get one for the kids and her i drive a 2005 Toyota i saved to buy for myself make 3k i a month  pay the rent the car and the rent is so expensive here 800 square feet is 1800 plus bills yeah we live paycheck to paycheck cant miss a day of work i use my taxes to pay for unexpected problems or a year of insurance i live in the ghetto am i happy no do i wont more yes but how when the system is designed to work against you
"What they are doing is amazing, however, I don't agree with feeding everybody. There should be a need, especially with limited resources."
"I grew up dirt poor.  My parents split up, mum had mental health problems (several admissions to psych ward) so we were on welfare.  I do not wish poverty on anyone.  It is a demeaning way of life.  We were the epitome of 'poor white trash.'  Most people looked at us like we were dirt.  There were no food banks or soup kitchens or school lunch programs when I was young. Mother got the welfare check and hopefully there was food until the end of the month.  
Poverty truly is like quicksand, it's very difficult to climb out. Thankfully, I had a bit of brains and broke free.  Even though I can afford a new car, I'm still driving my used 2009 Mazda. When I bought my house in 2006, I chose a house way under my mortgage approval limit.  I can afford food, but I grow a vegetable garden every year and have apple and pear trees in the back garden.
People are struggling everywhere.  Eventually, these handouts will come to an end. The need will be greater than the supply.  Then what? Desperate people do desperate things.  Shoplifting and looting are already out of control. It's going to get worse."
The price increases have not ended. How can reducing benifits cut higher prices?
"When I tried to understand why USA has issues with Venezuela an article read ""because of Socialism"" but when you see these kind of food programs and even the so called Obama care one would question what is the difference that USA claims with Venezuela, and capitalism folks should see these food programs because they made the people of USA fear about free food through doctored media. We are in a world where social responsibility too has to come through a registered pvt organization."
"This is so sad. We don't have so much issue here in my asian country, inflation not that bad, food price are still the same as last year. Even many ppl don't get government benefit when covid hits but we are survive because our economy remain open like florida and Family help each other. I hope everything getting better in usa.  God bless"
All this while farmers get into debt and record profits flow to the middlemen running grocery stores... heartbreaking. Bless those trying to help.
Very inefficient. Food stamps use less gasoline and there is the loss of productivity. The food that is being distributed is setting in less than ideal conditions shortening the shelf life of food that is probably nearly expired already. Food people are given that they don't want is wasted. Grocery stores (and other food donators) could have food that is sold at a discount if purchased with food stamps instead of donating it to a food pantry. Eg. Expired bread for 5 cents when using an EBT card etc. Walk in food pantries would be far more efficient but that requires a building. There has got to be a better way than this.
can afford all them newer vehicles but not food
"There never WAS a ' health emergency '
We sewered our economy and killed WAY more people than he Wu Flu ever could."
"It sounds better to say food ""distribution"" than food "" giveaway."" Thank you for all you do."
How is people going hungry not a public health emergency? Do we really need covid as an excuse to make sure everyone is fed?
News reporting: Go to the poorest most backward part of the country and use it as an example for the rest of the country. These people make the most of a handout and have a huge gray economy. Why do most of these people have nice looking cars?
"Back at the beginning of the massive increase (30% plus) in prices by the largest Corp (Oligarchs actually), Robert Reich , former Labor Secretary to 3 Pres and Professor of Public Policy (Berkely, CA) and has been teaching Public Policy for over 50 years, made the following observations of the financial condition of these Oligarchs.

These large Corp had ""record profits"" for the preceding 3 years before increasing their prices 30% plus.

Folks, they were and are not any reasons for this crazy inflation.  So, you people should be ""mad as Hell"" that our Politicians allow this to happen.  These Oligarchs did this for ""Profit and Power"".

When the Fu*ck will the good citizens wake up from a long sleep of apathy?  Remember Thomas Jefferson who said so wisely?

""The tree of liberty from time to time needs to be refreshed with the blood of patriots and tyrants.""

Apathy only breeds more greed from the Oligarchs and Politicians who take huge campaign contributions from the Oligarchs to turn a ""blind eye"" to this greed and rampant corruption.

This will not end without bloodshed!  This is not a recent happenstance.  According to Robert Reich, real wages for the middle class on down has actually been declining since the mid 1970's (in real purchasing power), while the compensation for the top management has been ""skyrocketing"".

Someone once ""defined insanity as doing what you have been doing and expect different results"".   Remember this ""you can fight on your feet or live on your knees"".

Also, remember Woody Guthrie famous (1930's) song ""This land is your land this land is my land"".  Not the rich Oligarchs and the corrupt Politicians that are screwing America for ""Profit and Power"".

This corruption must end.  Thomas Jefferson - send us an ""epiphany"", we need an awakening."
How about stop eating so much and lose some weight instead
Capitalism chewed this country out from the inside when it allowed corporations to close plants and move them overseas.
Bless this manager's giant heart.
We could feed everyone with a fraction of what the govt spends overseas.
"A lot of ppl abuse these food pantries; taking food when they can afford to buy their own. There's a video of Chinese immigrants bragging about all the food they took from a pantry then going on a spending spree and buying high-end clothes. 
Sadly, free food should be means-tested. And not just blind trust the people aren't stealing the food. And that means all food donations should go thru the gov't who can evaluate the need for food. the SNAP program is VERY generous, so if people are going to food pantries, there's a good chance they don't really qualify for the benefits."
Sorry not sorry I do not feel at all bad for any southerner that is going through poverty issues. Cry me a river. You voted for the people who did that to you and continue to vote for them.
"Expired bakery products are not food. Most of this food isn't even healthy. This is why many poor people are overweight. Rice and beans are cheap and healthy. Fruits, vegetables, and nuts, not processed garbage."
A lot of those people in line have some really nice cars yet they can't afford to buy groceries?
Hey isn't it wonderful we have 100s of billions of American tax payer money to give to Ukraine?
"just a humble question...is it illegal to hunt in KY ?  i ask because i see deer, turkey and chickens as a form of free food.  Today's generation has no since of community support, it seems like everyone is about self preservation."
Elections have consequences...who are you voting for?
"Adding insult to injury, over $100 billion of taxpayers money going to corrupt Ukraine over the last year.These folks across the country could have used that $$$..."
"we cant feed our own seniors, families, people down on their luck, homeless....  but we can clothe and house and give free cell phones to illegal immigrants? makes no sense."
Thank god for these food pantries and the people who staff them--may they be blessed many times over for the work that they are doing--we need to have MANDATORY government funded programs in schools that teach the basics of building cheap survival food pantries in homes of 20 and 30 somethings and how to cook basic simple nutricious cheap food--so they are not always going to a fast food restaurant for their meals...there needs to be a massive retraining effort...dts/usa
"Eh, they voted for this. Thoughts and prayers."
What percentage of people using these banks are actually just leeches? I'd say close to the majority.
"America is a sick, soulless, and cruel country! 
More tax cuts for the 1% and keep voting for repugs!"
"I find it interestig, if you look a the line of cars, you'll find a whole bunch of newer vehicles of 30k+ dollars and you need help with food?"
"Let Americans suffer but invite every ILLEGAL immigrant in & give them food, shelter, cell phone, medical & financial assistance. 
When are we gonna start voting America First!!"
They can afford a fancy 60k truck but not food? Priorities.
The 66 billion dollars that Biden gifted Ukraine would have reduced the number of food pantries.
Themasterrace ?
Nobody wants biden to run again
I can't believe I was paying for other people's covid benefits for this long... I didn't miss a day of work
There was a north Korean vibe about this idk
Get a job frfr. Stop trying to live free forever
they only cut like $80 in benefits
"We can't even afford to feed and house the needy people in our nation, yet our government lets millions of illegal immigrants in our country yearly and foots the bill for them with OUR taxes. Thats a slap in the face to the tax payers here. You can't solve issues like this until you solve your own first. There is no reason for anyone in this country to go hungry..."
Get a freaking job
"When millions and millions of not legals are intentionally being flooded into the nation. What do you expect.  They cannot work so how do they eat?  
THey are taking from legal residents. It is not good for anyone."
"$100s of gasoline spent by those vehicles sitting in line for hours.
As long as things are given away, there will be those willing to accept.
The irony is most all these people could spend the same amount of time working and simply buy food. 4hrs?
You can always work. Most choose not to. It's an excuse convoy."
More money for Ukraine and illegals
"I wonder how many people there refuse to better themselves and just rely on that program for food. Super sad situation those people are in tho :/ especially for the kids yet people continue to have kids with no stable income, go figure."
Conveniently left out why inflation is so high. Next on vice propaganda
This is why People sell there pills an do stuff they don't need too do
Thank you for helping the community
Don't have kids you can't afford dad gone
It's a shame that in a country like this people don't learn to save and be financially independent
"Kentucky...blue state? Hmmm, keep voting against your own benefits morons"
"Alot of those ppl could also offer to help out as well which would make things go faster, and they would still get their stuff, just make it easier for everyone!~
That should be a stipulation, if ya gonna continue to receive the services, then you must atleast help out for 1 day, that will benefit not only you but others!~"
"What is the average income in the U.S.? Was it $60.000
What happened?"
All of the hours that these mooches spend in these lines they could be working to buy their groceries
Long-term it's not good for society to feed people who won't work....
And a ton of them voted for republicans who are making these cuts to them. So i feel nothing for them. You get the system you vote for.
What really disgusts me is when I'm on the way to the grocery store on my fixed-income driving my 32 year-old car I see people lined up at the food pantry driving new Cadillacs BMW's and Mercedes. I guess it shouldn't be unexpected considering the lack of desire these days to do the right thing.
I can't wait for the day when socialism destroys this greedy capitalist country!
shame on thm u get gun n drug cheap thn food thats great usa .....#cia
"There are an awful lot of vehicles in line that cost a lot more than anything I have ever owned and ever plan on owning in the foreseeable future.
I would need to analyze their personal finance behavior before contributing to the cause.
I would get in line, but I am usually too busy working."
Why do Kentucky citizens vote for lawmakers that reduce SNAP benefits? Rand Paul wins again and again and he seems to be in favor of small government and that means no benefits. He's like sink or swim f'ers.
It surprises me to see those people waiting in their cars while not having money to pay for their own food. They prefer to pay for gas and vehicule maintenance rather than their own food. That's stupid and irresponsible.
Shame on the boomers and shame on our government.
Probably the same people that see red when you say the word 'socialism'.
"And then remember that Republicans want to abolish socialism, they want to abolish everything from social security to...yes, food stamps (SNAP). How is it possible that poor working class people still vote for these party? They are shooting themselves in the foot, literally."
POLITICS IS JUST THE ENTERTAINMENT DIVISION OF THE MILITARY INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX! Frank Zappa
Get back to work. The covid excuse is gone now.
This is Bidens and other politicians' plans . The plan is to get rid of those who can't work and replace them with low wage immigrants.
"Well yeah, corporations raised prices well beyond what inflation demanded, then the extra benefits go away,,, durrr,... what'd you expect."
Great America
Some of the people lining up in their cars seem to have some pretty nice cars. Do they really need to take from a food bank?
They already tjiped rveryone no more mr nice.
Why didn't they give more benefits to those who worked? Could have fixed the economy by doing that.
Never seen so many obese people complain about not getting enough food.
"I parked by a local food bank when visiting my doctor.  So many well dressed people, with long nails and driving great cars getting food and driving off.  Not like they are making deliveries.

EVERYONE in this video is FAT.  STOP having kids you can't afford so this problem doesn't continue into the coming generations."

Look at the brightside at least my rent went up 30%  starting this month...and the cost of food is never been higher...lol.
"We dont live in a republic. We live in a rapacious oligarchy, controlled by a handfull of billionaires and corporations. Until politicians actually pass legislation to help people, and not their corporate masters, things will just keep getting worse."

"i see vicewent to white areas to film, who would have thought."
all of you commenting on people's weight have no idea what their health conditions are. don't judge.
Arent these countey bumpkins the same peoole that vote for trump and say everyone else is on food stamps. Funny thing is most of them are on food stamps theselves and going to food pantries.
"The snap program is the problem, just like all the corrupt social programs the government fails to manage. Why do people think it matters who you vote for? Every politician is corrupt, every social program is unsustainable and the economy is about to collapse thanks to the ""success"" of inflation (intentionally framed that like a Whitehouse press briefing)."
Wonder how many AMERICANS are going hungry while they give the illegals food and a swanky hotel to trash while our own citizens go hungry  i don't know about you people but I'm getting sick of it
Illegals will be getting those food benefits!
Ask these people who they vote for
Count your blessings gratitude works.
I went to buy a 10 pound bag of potatoes today and it was 5 bucks at Walmart. It used to be under 2 dollars.
There's going to be a great depression PTII
The majority of these are in red states.
TY TY TY Not a black or Brown face in the bunch WE ALL need to see this !
Then there are those that don't need the food pantries but go for free food. I work with people who are shameless about this.
Girl in pink is hot
What is going on im my nation the hate is unreal !
"Work for retail company and I always see people buying useless amounts of items they don't necessary need.  If they have holes on their clothing and shoes definitely replace them but for unnecessary items like makeup, fake eyelashes, new handbags are just useless.  Extra $95 dollars cut from food stamps is not much."
"Things are horrific. My cousin who is babysitting for a living, is struggling so badly, that she asked for soap for Christmas. When I get my SSDI check, I am $18 in the negative after bills are paid and that does not include any food, toiletries, household goods or pet supplies. It's a nightmare. I am always robbing Peter to pay Paul. Our food banks here most of the time hand out spoiled produce. Its very frustrating. Grateful for any help tho"
"Sometimes,you just need to get a second job. People got used to handouts and becane lazy."
most these ppl have really nice cars.... hmmmmm
shes 80-whore-old lol
"These are conservative areas in the country with hardship, but conservative law makers nationwide are  not often  fans of SNAP benefits."
Plus all the illegals immigrants are flooding the food banks
"Seems like we need to print more money, raise taxes and make things far more affordable. Definitely the more Government has to spend the better the problems get, thats easy to see."
Only in America do the morbidly obese in their forty thousand dollar vehicles shamelessly show up at a food bank
"Americans are starving and we have open boarders givign illegal imigrants anything they want. Our Politicians have failed us.

Also if you have a IQ of 10 and dont have a job it would be great if you didnt pop out a family of 5. Freaking nuts..."
"She's got four children. There's her problem right there, pumping out units that she clearly couldn't afford, and then putting out the begging bowl when, surprise, surprise, she cannot feed them all. DOH!"
"Most of these people will vote for Joe Liden, for giving welfare, while it's his fault the inflation is so high they need it."
We need to start growing our own produce and the government should allow people to raise animals for food. There are too many restrictions.
The bad part is the government wants them right there in that situation so they have to be dependent. The government doesn't want people to do better than what they grew up and because that means people will know their worth and know what the government is doing to others is wrong it's a vicious cycle and thank goodness that I have been a good enough shopper in a good-enough cook that I have been able to make grocery stretch so have not needed to hit the food pantries yet but I know that my time is coming I'm not above it at all and I do get help from my kids school so that also helps a lot too
A whole minute long ad plays before i can watch?!
"This people can't afford to buy food? Your kidding me! They have car and can buy gasoline. But can't afford to buy their food. I don't believe that. The real one's are the one who cannot get their and true children who are helpless. THOSE GUYS ARE BIG AND STILL ABLE TO WORK! Gee, he has NO SHAME to get food there. Go work 2 jobs. I work 2 jobs 12 hours shift."
how can these people afford cars but not food
Yeah that's basically my household. I don't live in this state but our SNAP went from around 250 to 90 as well. Only downside is 99% of foodbanks in our area are not very accessible without a car. My spouse was in a life threatening car accident (driving our car that was older than us)- we are still recovering from that as well as trying to keep up with rapid price increases etc. I'm as a loss! I have nobody who can help pick up food... And I can only imagine how many other people are in a similar spot- especially our oldest generation. Not all of them have someone who can help. Its scary. Its a fucking shame.
"i dont work to pay for your children. the government dont have money, its taken from other workers."
It was never going to be a permanent thing. What did you do before covid?
This is so hard to believe that this really happens to people of the country that spends trillions of dollars in war.
The funny thing most getting snap benefits are republicans.
Vice going bankrupt
"I suspect a lot of these people would vote different than me, yet these are exactly the programs and people I wish my tax dollars supported more. I genuinely don't know what the answer is anymore"
Thank you for this insight into other communities in our country. Thank you to those helping.
Food and proper nutrients are different things
"If you can afford to drive over 2 hours at these gas prices, you should be able to buy food in your area."
Looks like most in this video aren't missing many meals.
Nicky stasy is a real queen and blessing from god
No food but nice cars for the most of them
Trump wanted to cut SNAP benefits by $182 billion dollars over 10 years btw
"These people will turn right around and vote for the very people who don't give a damn about them. I'm sorry but my kids eating will always be more important than religion, who can marry who, what bathroom people are using, whether a woman wants to keep her baby or not and any other reason people use to justify voting against their own best interest. I would rather my family be fed then to worry about what someone else is doing."
Stop. Having. Kids. You. Can't. Afford.
"Yes but we are setting up illegals in hotels and free food, instead on focusing on are u.s. citizen."
"I wonder whether all those folks there enjoy all the trinkling down that was promised to them by Republicans. Just lower the taxes for the rich and corporations and the poor, too, will enjoy prospeity, they said. and the poor believed them..."
That lady sitting there doing needle point not knowing you can sell each one for hundreds if you are experienced in it is sad. She needs an Etsy shop
There was a food bank I went to all during the pandemic. It was walk through only so we had to stand in line for 3-4 hours. Very hard on your back. Then we would have to walk home with it. Great food though and I was so grateful for it. Now that I'm 60 they will deliver it to me. This is the best and a blessing.
"They're just lazy. Pull yourself up by your bootstraps. Stop playing the victim. Stop living off the government. Make America Great Again!

I noticed that there was an absence of those comments, so I figured I'd leave them here."
Better off working at kroger and bag groceries on the weekend. I have a farm and people say oh you can give to the food bank. I only do that on non sellables but  I still expect to be paid for the stuff I sell.

"How $$ we spend on wars Year???

Western Illinois is in the same shape.
"This is 100% needless and a manufactured crisis.  There is not a shortage of food and SNAP benefits are not some massive proportion of the Federal budget and in terms of aid provided by the state, it's a question of priorities.  This almost entirely comes back to voting choices.  People would literally rather starve than look at an alternative."
"We need to put home economics back in school. Teach people to budget, shop correctly, and save. Also, I bet they all have a cellphone, cable, etc. You afford what value."
Start learning how to fast. You won't eat as much and save money lol. Most of yall are out of shape anyways.
"it's simple really: I'd happily donate food or money if I could be certain that it wouldn't go to:
1) Feral blacks shrieking about reparations
2) Illegal immigrant garbage who already destroyed an entire continent"
at least theyre all driving super nice cars except for the one actual dude who looks poor.
Get a job
"At some point people need to get back on their feet, and while pride will motivate that progression for many individuals others will need motivation via subtraction of scaffolding.  Additionally, the money for all of this has to come from somewhere, and unless we want to pay higher taxes some other public funding would need to be cut."
"The prices are 4 times what we started with and are reduced back too. 
No person understands that it's hard to make good food on no extra to do so on."
CIA funded News outfit spreading misinformation as normal here....when will Buzzfeed go out of business already?
imagine weeks without food when all Biden's migrants arrive.
The government shouldn't be holding your hand and wiping your bottom 3 years later. People get too comfortable. I didn't even know they were still giving out handouts.

"Can't afford food but over half of them are driving 20-60,000 vehicles?. I drive and have always had used cars.  Is upsetting to see this."
How can these people afford a car but not food? Odd very odd
"The steady diet of bread, noodles, rice, potatos....everybody uses them to 'fill in' but it is extremely unhealthy to go for MONTHS doing that.  Gods Bless the food banks; especially for fresh produce, and whatever meat and dairy they can spare. I'm happy to make whole meals of caultiflower, cabbage, or any other fresh things I am provided!  I don't miss the meat so much anymore. the food bank here had many bags of hard pears left; we took four, and came back with a case of jam.  Some people aren't able to figure out what to do with ingredients.  A case of over ripe tomatos means we'll have months of chili, spaghetti, etc.  We can do it with a little help from our friends!  A favorite summer meal of mine as a child was roasted corn, tomatos, and watermelon (not together) so I hit seasonal vegetables when they are cheapest."
they vote against their own interests...
"We had to cut the pandemic SNAP benefits. It along with other extreme spending, caused inflation to go to 11%"
"Biden is sending all your money to the Ukraine, that is why you have no food"
"WTH is a ""Covid benefit?"" 

Oh, just extra money for people already sapping the system dry. Go figure.
You guys that are all sad about this need to chip in another 20-30% more of YOUR pay to fund more ""benefits"" for the ""poor people."" Like the guy driving the $40K-60K RAM pick up that looks new inside. 
Poor guy, he can barely afford his $800 a month car payment and still buy milk without other people's money. Keep voting Democrat and keep ending up ""poor"" in your ""never ending thing."""
that's nothing title 42 just ended
Hahahaha at 59s someone with a clean new looking f150 got in to the benefits line. That person must really be struggling. What a joke
WE NEED A NEW GOVERNMENTAL PARTY NOW!

This is sad but our taxes are finite and we must help the shareholders first. /S
"Good, we don't need to rely on government food programs. Go work and buy your food like everyone else. I don't have a high school diploma or G.E.D and I have a background that prevents me from getting certain jobs but I'm making it no problem without government assistance. If someone from the bottom of barrel can make it then why can't the rest of you?"
And yet they all voted for Moscow Mitch
you cannot convince me that the so called richest country in the world cant find any solutions to fix this but corruption and greed is now flowing in the very veins of government.
Instead of giving the rich breaks please give the poor people benefits to
I have to admit food prices have gone up quite dramatically I remember back in the day when I first moved to West Texas I couldn't believe my eyes you could buy 6 pork chops for like$ 3.50 at the local Hispanic market. Now that same grocery store is owned by a bigger franchise and that means the prices have changed quite a bit that's the same pack of pork chops now runs you around $9. But I have to say that at least in my household as long as we eat fresh and healthy usually I can keep the cost of groceries around $100 per week for a family of four. Fresh fruits and vegetables have gone up in price but not as much as meats and other grocery items. It's no longer possible to purchase DiGiorno's and frozen food like my mom used to back in the day because that specific type of food is very expensive. I think the important thing here is to do a research fine foods that are low-cost that are easy to make like lentos for example . I use a lot of beans and rice for sides I usually prepare them in different ways but at the end of the day it's usually one of the lower-cost items that you can purchase. I think as we grow older we need to learn to manage our budget and stick to it.
Look at all these new f150s driving up for free food
Teach these people to farm fresh veg and fruits I know not everybody is able to grow crops but even a small garden to help you through the years would do wonders
"This is what economic inequality is. See how now so many people have less than say in the 1980s before Reaganism/Clinton and all of that? Back when a single working man could have a family, stay at home mom, afford a house, afford a car, be able to go to the hospital and doctor, be able to go on vacation, feed a family of 4 who would have high level education available to them for small fees, all of which could be afforded with a sales/retail/etc (blue collar) job. Compared to now, 2 working adults per household that are barely able to scrape by. 

Where do you think all of that difference went? Did it just disappear? No. It went straight to the upper class who now instead of paying it in tax, get to loan it to the government who will pay it back with interest (so when they rave about the high US debt and that we need to reduce it, just know, that class in total has in their portfolios, the vast majority of those trillions in US debt. They are lying to you when they say they are anti federal debt. They are lending it to the government who then uses it (mostly) on their behalf and it's making them obscenely rich. They also have other things in their portfolios, like thousands of houses, all of the best land and etc. They then mislead you as to why this is all happening, by blaming it on other sections of the working class (people who aren't white). It's an age old strategy of ""divide and rule"" and it works extremely well).

The point is, is that all of that wealth shifted upwards. Which is why you and everyone else that is part of the working class has so much less.


The solution should probably be clear. It's taxing them and using those funds to enact New Deal programs which brings money into working class hands who use it to buy the services that they desperately need. There services then stimulate the economy and the increased tax revenues are used to pay off debt as well as saved for a rainy day (for economic crashes)."
Yikes

Capitalism works
And yet undoubtedly some of the people visiting that food bank will gladly re-elect Mitch McConnell and the rest of the neocons who have no shame in dismantling desperately needed social problems at every turn

I'm from the county over from Wolfe County/Hazel Green. We all don't vote ass backwards. Some of us have sense.
Liberals see this and say state Gov't should keep benefits. Conservatives see this and think well if they werent giving so much aid to immigrants and foreign affairs they'd have more leftover for us.
There is something wrong in a Nation where it feeds other countries first and where the UNICEF is Located at and people had to line in food pantries.
Relax everyone.. I'm sure all those tax cuts to corporations and the rich will trickle down to all of us any day now...

plenty of money for bombs while our people go hungry Americans are spineless garbage for not revolting while their fellow citizens become hungry and homeless
Remember the govt paid our farmers to DESTROY our crops during covid!!!!!!!
We can't feed the people in the US. But we can feed the Ukraine and Mexico

The dynamic is to make sure these people died 10 to 20 years sooner than people that have access to healthcare houses education etc etc. It is 100% what the American Republican party is doing"
Retail grocery Outlets are price gouging 100% while America is at its most vulnerable financially. Remember if you see somebody stealing food just ignore him and go on about your day.
"But corporations and the wealthy are doing great, the system is operating as designed"
These people vote for the politicians that are gutting and cutting these programs lol
How are you poor in America lol
You know what would help the younger non disabled people stave off the need to get food stamps? Easy access to birth control and comprehensive sex education. Having four kids in a single parent household would make anyone need help.
Im glad vice did a story on this.  Im just one the millions trying to survive myself and I found this cut a hit.
You guys had 3 years to figure it out though.....
"for fun, we try to spend as much time as we can in nature and the forests. doing things like: Hiking, reading, drawing, painting and listening to music. this is all free and gets us away from the stress of work."

"in my country, everyone has to drive small cars, no one can afford those big American trucks and SUV'S and we certainly can't afford the petrol to make them run. 
We have to budget for food, cook from"" scratch"" as you call it. and we don't ""eat out"" or have fast foods.  and yet everyone seems happy anyway."
"I'm confused. I'm not from America. if everyone is so poor, why are they driving nice cars and if they're hungry, why are they or (most of them) so obese. this doesn't make sense."
I was receiving $400 covid food benefit on top of $200 regular snap which is really backwards.  I did not know what the $400 was for because I only applied for snap after covid hit.  Imo it was too much why would it be twice as much as my regular benefit?  On top of that a couple large pebt payments.  Still don't understand how they came up with these numbers.

"Seened a video of migrants being housed in upscale hotels and trashing out hot meals, now this"
Some of these people in really nice cars someone explain that to me
"Pantries can't give food for those with needs to not have things that are diet restrictive like if your vegan they will give you meat or tell you to not get the meat/eggs but they will not allow you more cans, veggies, or whatever you may need, if you're diabetic they'll give you carbs and will tell you don't take the bread or sweets but you won't get to choose or in other cases be wholly unable to find stuff your diet needs this isn't picky it's you must eat this way for your medical reasons. 

Pantries also have bread & fruit that is 1 day away from expiring they give you so by mid week it's moldy and you won't be able to come back till next month."
"So they are driving a 90,000$ truck and eat at the pantry?
I have a feeling this isnt just needy, which bothers me."
This is just the beginning unfortunately. I shudder to think about what the future holds for our plummeting society...
I just see lazy ppl
"Most grocery stores refuse to donate to pantries. . . They also throw tens of thousands of dollars worth of food that's expired or close to expiration every week at most locations in a major city.
This should change."
"I happened to lose my job as they got rid of the extra benefits. We def could've used the ""extra"" money for food then, but I'm so glad the food bank was just a block away bc the line was so freaking long. I just waited until it died down and went then"
Most of these hungry people look rather plump.. and they all have four kids at 25 years old.
"So...are these benefits supposed to last indefinitely?

Maybe if politicians stopped spending to put illegals and anchor babies on section 8, EBT, stopped wasting money on ""tiny homes"", started enforcing the law of the land, etc. instead of trying to pander to every group, Americans wouldn't have to suffer."
"The lady with the 4 boys doesnt have money for food, but has money for her acrylic nails? Got it."
"There is plenty of work in construction, landscaping, fast food, in richer states, migrate and get a job.   Can someone explain me why they do not move to other states? I did it, and I am better now."
"Unfortunately in this corporate controlled society, food prices are ridiculously high that ordinary people cannot afford the basics of food without government subsidy."
Ebt and snap canceled...unless your a fresh immigrant!!!Then it's a free ride!
"Pulls up in 2023 model cars:
"" i DoNt HaVe GroCeRiES"" 
I wonder why -_-"
"I'm not in America, so excuse my ignorance, but 2 hour drive to get to a food pantry, how does that work? The gas expense is enough to buy food surely"
"The public of America is unaware that everything occurring is agenda of control and the collapse of the country. Oil is owned by the same global entity that owns the USD, Medical profession, pharma, food industry, and on and on. Gas prices are high because they want them to be. Food prices are high because they want them to be. Forced ""vaccination"" of an injection fulfilling to protocols whatsoever for certification because they want to. Everything is systematic agenda."
Imagine how the people who have been paying cash for food the entire time without a raise.... THEY ARE THE ONES Who ARE STILL WAITING FOR HELP
It's a drive up food pantry....so what about the people that can't afford food and don't have a car?
"Doesn't help that grocery prices more than doubled in the last 2 years or so. They could quadruple and they still wouldn't increase benefit amount, they only did it temporarily because of the health crisis. They don't care about people struggling in their country. They'd rather send billions of dollars to Ukraine"
think about our priorities and think about how these people aren't apart of them. perople are focusing on trans people so much that we're forgetting about everyone.
I thought that republicans were against the welfare state? Let them starve! Perhaps they're against OTHERS receiving help.
Stop illegals helps those in our country
"What all of you have got to learn how to do, is to steal from the Grocery Stores.  Go when it is really busy, and wear big baggy clothes.  Then, tell you kids to put stuff in their backpacks.  It can easily save me $100 to (maybe) $150 / month.  And, your kids won't get in much trouble, because you weren't watching them.  If you got questions, I'll help you learn how."
"This is our lives too.  We just can't keep making things work, as everything has gotten so expensive."
Another reason I say your vote doesn't count. Why even go vote when this is our end result. Year after year.
"The president of the food distribution scheme...man you can tell she has a heart of gold. Empathy is something lacking in modern America, it makes me happy to see some people still possess it."
The person with the Toyota Land Cruiser 4:30 needs to sell it for 20-30k and buy an old Corolla or old 4Runner if they really need 4wd.
Sorry no sympathy here. This is what these people vote for
Keep voting republican. They will take all your rights away.
GMOs jesus
Pathological
"why you keep having kids when you can't financially afford to, like the lady with 4 boys, vice needs to make a video on this subject next"
Prices are so bad i use to be on the money every checkout most of my adult life i could call what the bill would be within 5$ sometimes 10$ but anymore if i do it it's so off like 50 to 80 bucks easy and really only getting close to half of what i got before now i can walk home most trips went from 8 bags to 4 especially after having to use those bags after the bag ban
All the money spend on wars and the people suffering from lack of food.
I wonder how many the price of an aircraft carrier would feed. Just wondering
All these folks looks pretty well fed
What were they expecting? Free money = inflation
"The economic inequality is appalling in the world's richest country. However, people should also not have kids that they cannot afford to support. Single people are also homeless!"
Keep throwing money overseas Joe!!! 4 more years to finish the job!!!!
Vice please don't go away. Find some funding. NO ONE ELSE is telling these stories.
Americas looking really great these days. Lol
"I am from Canada and I am genuinely curious as to why the Republicans are so vicious to their own voters in the states they control. 
Its almost like these people are stuck in a relationship with an abuser.
Is there any sort of educational outreach program where people could go around these areas and talk with people and help them understand how they are voting against their own interests and based on culture war nonsense?
This was sad to watch. Hopefully as the next generation is overwhelmingly progressive things will slowly change."
"i don't want to judge,but some people who are in that line,drive big trucks,pretty new cars. you say you cant' afford food but can afford a new or new-ish car or a gas guzzler? in Europe you don't see this,unless those who ask for benefits are actually trying to get undeserved benefits."
3people had 3 years to sort things out but prefer the easy way of just collecting benefits
And they keep voting Republican.
bruh people in the south heavily rely on govt assistance and ironically the majority vote for people that want to get rid of them. that's why people make fun of them for being stupid hicks. they dont understand this.
Why isn't nobody planning large gardens or raising livestock like I have to do??
And I'm willing to bet on my life everyone in that line is a republican...they need to tell their reps and senators who are trying to cut those very benefits
"remember people, politicans do not have to worry about food pantrys, either meds or eating, gas prices going up, rent going up, what do we/i eat today/tonight. they will never starve or have any of our worries. they can talk all they want how they care, even trump doesn't go a day without eating or worry about meds. or on almost empty in the tank. (i'm picking on him, biden, macarthy, shuner, cruz, green, all of them. they can shout and rant and we keep listening to their voices, but none of them tell us what they will do for the ones who need help. oh but they do not like each other they say it's them not us, they are picking on me (oh boo hoo) go a day without eating or takeing your meds, then let me know how they are getting picked on and they let us know how ""they"" are evil or deep stated or i am for america and it's people. yes i can see how much they are for us. look at the lines, food banks struggleing, look at the homeless (not the drugies) but the ones who do not want to be homeless but can't get a leg up. make american great again, give money freely to those who do not want to work (and expect free money) great slogons; but they do not fill bellies or keep you warm or help your situation. 100 senators, 9 sup. justices, roughly 450 represenitives, pres./vice pres. plus cabinet members/staff so say 600est. who do nothing to help or will never feel what we go through. (do not get me started on k-street) lobbiest. long rant, sorry, my dander is up, my hackles also and i'm mad and sorry what they are putting use through just so they can be on t.v. or bloggs. be well people. if we can help each other, do it, they will not. none of them will, none."
The United States is going downhill. This is not the best country in the world. The evidence of that is apparent.
Dayton Ohio is same way ...they need to give the extra back to offset inflation
The rich want to kill or exterminate the poor
"Most of these people work, and those who don't are either too old or no longer capable of working. Wish today's Christian churches were less about telling people how to vote and more about Jesus's teachings..."
"So at the same time we are letting all these people for free into the country, we are also taking away resources from those who need it. Nice
Fucking America"
Billions to Ukraine
The same thing happened here in the U.K.
But why have four or five kids if you can't feed them? It's sad but people don't think about that sort of s*** when they're f******
I don't understand if you drive 2 hours one way that would be at least $40-60 in gas...hiw much value ofnfood are they getting?
Kentucky: 61.8% voted republican.
"If you are young and healthy go get a job. Most companies are hiring in America. 
A dollar is better than no dollar."
Zoom out on the older cars so you can see the rust but zoom into the newer cars (2:09 - 2:41).
Odd cos they all still have cars.
And now all these migrants will make it hard to get snything. !!!!!!!
I'm college educated and living in a perpetually developing country. It's rather hard for me to sympathize because their living standard is still better than mine.
"You Will Always Hear Silly Americans Saying People in Africa Live on Less than 5 Dollars a Day, How Much do These people Live on a Day. Catch a wake up we are all Struggling. Love from South Africa"
How can we donate to this pantry??
"The worst part is some of these parking lot style food banks won't serve you if you don't have a car. It's criminal. Not everyone has a car or a drivers license and to prioritize people with cars over those without is disgusting. 
During COVID I tried to hit a food bank but they wouldn't accept anyone walking and told me to come back with a friend with a car. Long story short I didn't get any food. 
People with cars have a means of transport, a high value asset and a place to live if everything goes tits up for them. They've no business going to a food bank to take food away from the truly disheveled who can't afford gas, car note and insurance."
My channel is based off the food bank and how to cook with the food you can receive from it! Food banks have saved my family and I don't know what I would do without them!! I'm sharing this video as far as I can! Thanks for putting in the work to bring awareness to the struggles of the working poor and letting others know there is help!
"Keep voting against your better interests GQP voters, you seem to really like the suffering they bring you and us. Oh, and continue to blame President Biden because it makes you feel so good to project. Traitors"
FJB
"Covid barely hurt anyone compared to our policies that are going to be killing millions more. No money, no food and no food equals dead bodies. Fear"
We have this type of problem and yet we still have to watch out from more people coming into the country with the same needs. The government needs to step up or the US won't be the way it's supposed to be. The American dream
Maybe if we send Ukraine more money and bombs Americans will be able to eat regularly once again
Meanwhile biden sending millions to Ukraine
Are these the same folks that rage against anything communist or socialist? Hope not. They don't mind getting handouts from uncle same
Go all out
WHY are there still people expecting Covid benifits? LMFAO
"We are literally slaves with some slight freedoms but those freedoms come with fees, licensing, dues, debt"
Not like lots of places are hiring
But the conservatives tell me if we helped people then we would have breadlines.
@ElenaCardone the food pantry worker in this video has more class than you will ever have. You should watch and take notes.
"@GrantCardone do you think these people are losers because they make under 400k a year? Does @ElenaCardone think they sound like rednecks because of their accent, without considering there is a human attached to that accent?"
Aren't churches helping  ?
It's so weird to see fat people in cars complaining about food. The rest of the world is scratching their head.
"Goodbye VICE, so glad you are bankrupt"
It's insane to me that in the US people can own fairly new cars and still be too poor to afford food. In the rest of the world the car would be the first thing to go.
Richest County in the world this shldnt be happening.
If they control the food they control us
No lie. I went into a Safeway Super Market today to steal my lunch. The entire store was reconfigurered so that you cannot leave without paying. Aluminum bars walled any exit. It was crazy. The security guard let me slide and take the food
and they couldn't find a job from before covid started and during covid and after covid ended? see that's the thing that makes me mad im over here working meanwhile you got these lazy fucks asking for handouts when they should've put that time into finding a job cause there were plenty of them so can make no excuse
Yet a FOREIGN country like Ukraine gets over 100 BILLION by Congress to send Soldiers to their Death while are children are STARVING?
Liberalism in a Nut Shell
This has to be Fake News ?   Joey Biden Says The Economy Is Booming   More Jobs than ever
I appreciate how the president knew how to check her privilege
If you're poor why tf you having kids
"you want food, manage your money, go get a job, sell your new car and camper you bought with covid money."
Happy that the media is finally showing white people on welfare. Maybe help will come when it's white faces that are being impacted.
"Here are some facts from the U.S Department of Agricutlture :
- There are 12 million ABLE-BODIED Americans of food stamps between the ages of 18-59. 
- of the ABLE-BODIED on food stamps, 64.6% of these moochers don't work, period!
-29.4% work part-time"
If you give a man a fish you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.
"Anyone else seeing a lot of nicer late model vehicles that these ""suffering"" people could sell to make some more money or at the very least get rid of a substantial monthly cost?
Not saying all of these people dont need assistance, but some of these are just losers who dont want to work hard or find extra ways to ear income. This is modern America, rely on others for your survival and basic needs. The GoFundMe generation!"
"""Greatest country in the world,"" ladies and gentlemen."
More money for Isreal 6 billion more gods chosen people and remember God wins
That kid sipping on soda in his cup... Broke my heart.
"Plenty of jobs out there , welfare rats"
"I feel bad for the elderly and people with severe disabilites but there are so many people using and abusing these benefits simply because they are far too lazy to try and better their situation on their own. It bogs down the entire system and makes it harder for people that actually need the help. The worst are the women who are already in poverty and keep those legs open 24/7. Things are popping out as often as theyre going in. Fun fact, contraception is cheaper than children."
The food pantry is so clutch im not ashamed to admit they have and continue to help through one of my hardest times in life and i cant wait to someday to return the favor
"I work in tech sector in Seattle 
I now that the blue states subsidize the red states, i get annoyed about some thing 
I never never get annoyed about food stamps , if people need to eat; they need to eat. 
When my tax dollars go for food stamps , education and library,healthcare I am willing to pay more 
Tax dollars to help people not to destroy; ie military industrial complex"
People that voted for the Face Eating Leopard Party simply shocked when leopards start eating their faces!
But the US gave TRILLIONS of dollars to Ukraine for weapons!!!
HOW DO THESE PEOPLE WORK AND NOT AFFFORD FOOD?! RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE!!!!
Think of all that gas being used and the $ that's costing them.
Well maybe those morons should've been STOCKING UP instead of buying steak.
Nicer and newer cars than my old Toyota!
"Absolutely disgusting! The government has the money and resources to feed and house every American, but they choose not to because they hate the poor."
"Thanks Lord for your salvation.
Thanks Lord for your peace"
Its going to get alot worse with all the illegals coming over
Wow didnt know Kentucky was a state full of liberals looking for handouts. Very Sad!
"5:28 Okay let me get this straight. You are poor , barely have food but DO have 4 kids. That's some good thinking that"
"Meanwhile, humans continue to post on social media and not do a single thing to take action and to overthrow the system. Stupid humans."
Chocolate cake?!
True
Don't have kids before you are financially secure.
"Dimes will get ya donuts, that HALF the voting populace will do something completely STOOPID!! Like blamethe rich/wealthy for this.
It's THAT mindset that's leading to the demise of VICE."
"Wait a minute! So these ""poor"" people drive expensive cars and spend a lot of money on fuel, just to get free food!!! Something doesn't add up!! Americans are such spoiled brats!!"
fake and untrustral channel
It should have never come to an end and been expanded
"Seems like the biggest problem is people having families but not enough income to support them. The suburban American dream is dead. I live in Arkansas, it's a cheap place to live, and I wouldn't feel comfortable having a wife and kid making less than $100,000 a year."
"Ive actually stopped going to the food banks, and adopted the habit of eating less... Better to stop now in case it gets worst later"
It's crazy how republicans are working with companies and financial institutions to keep inflation up and their anti consumer practices legal. Lots of companies are blatantly forming monopolies and duopolies etc and the governing bodies are turning a blind eye.
"look at thoes cars on 04:20 , as a fact half tha cars are brand new, you talk about $95 benefits. This feels like waste of internet data."
how can they own car but now afford to pay for bread? can't they just bike or something
Alot of jobs out there but not enough workers tbh. They're on the lower end of the pay scale though.
"A bit hard to watch, especially seeing all the seniors in line but it's the reality of the world. I wonder where their families are... maybe they are alone or their families are even worse off?!? Dang, this is depressing."
I see Jeep and Kia
10 million jobs are waiting for you. So why this people needs more help?
"Ironically enough, one could draw a symbolic parallel to the food lines of USSR.."
Cars worth around 20-50k are getting 100$ of food?
"don't worry. 
the rich will be just fine. 
that's what's important isn't it?"
At least the long lines should weed out the freeloaders from the people that actually need assistance. Nothing worse than people taking from those that are truly desperate
"Hey everyone, start volunteering at your local food bank! We always need help! Times have been crazy busy since benefits were cut by conservative politicians. (I am an independent) I myself usually end up filling 2000 plus grocery bags in one morning on the assembly line. My arms get worn out, and good people go home with some food. Donating while you show up to volunteer is another win."
the funniest part is that they all have cars they drive lol.....
It saddens me that a good portion of the ppl waiting in that line of cars voted for the very republican politicians who cut their benefits.
"This is the Vice I love, showing the real deal"
Get a job!!!!!!
"I live in NY and completely changed what I buy and what I cook. I found that instead of just going without, actually ADAPTING saved me. I learned how to cook alot of exotic meals that use rice. I cook meats as curries etc and pour it over rice as it lasts longer, calls for less meat. I make more things from scratch like hummus etc I took parts from stone of different cultures, got online and learned the recipes. India,middle east,guyana,Hispanic cuisine etc they have good food that stretches far. I'm American black and going out of my range really helped me save $$ and survive. The foods good as well and not as hard to cook as you'd think. you can eat pretty well if your willing to adjust what/how you eat."
Terrible government we have. I'm sure politicians don't get hungry
"People were getting assistance and I'm over here eating once a day if that is Insane.

4:48 they even get a few treats like cookies and potato chips...  just a moment ago you showed full chocolate cakes.  You can tell the many people there who take advantage of this when they can afford groceries... Pathetic!"
crazy how i work and i cant afford most of those cars.
"america spends colossal amounts of money on the military, while millions live in poverty! smh"
All the money in the state is going to black welfare!
The thought that comes to mind is the people in Syria...
"Bunch of white people? Facinating.. I thought it was only blacks, immigrants and the woke radical left who needed free handouts and help."
They keep voting for  republicans kentucky has one of the most important poverty rate in America  but they don t care they did the same   with obamacare they are the first beneficiaries of the law but keep voting for people  who want to repeal it  I guess the culture war is more important
Wonderful isn't it?  Worse than the Great Depression or the second world war? Wonderful how our governments have  screwed us!
Sad
"I know too MANY people (dozens) on food assistance programs who ALL have plenty of alcohol, cigarettes, vapes, and/or marijuana thanks to these government assistance programs. How dare anyone deprive them of these funds!"
stop complaining...just pull yourself up on your bootstraps.....
Is the connection made between Republican led decisions and the suffering of these folks? I'm curious to know how many of these people have kept the concussed turtle in power or voted twice for orange mussolini. There's no reason why anyone should be hungry in the wealthiest nation in human history.
"The elderly, the handicapped, the mentally ill, soldiers, sailors, will be refused services. The usefulness of your physical body has past and Noone cares about what happens to you now. I truly feel like those in power want everyone without a x large bank account to kill themselves.  Because looking at the issue is just too much for them to bare. This country has failed its citizens and the future generations to come."
They choose to INFLATE the prices of everything.
Shame on USA!
I mean Kentucky is a subbasement I feel bad for any Democrats effected by this. But Republicans deserve to suffer.
"Bouta move to KY...
I'm on SNAP in CT, if I drove an F-150 I wouldn't qualify.  Not saying it's better I'm just saying my life could LOOK a lot better in Kentucky, Apparently. All of their cars are so nice...jelly!"
Vote Republicans out! They are blocking bills that are designed to support people.
And most of these fools will still vote Republican
Bums. Try getting a job
@VICENews Since this is the second time Dallas Texas had a mass shooting would you be interviewing 2016 Dallas shooting survivors in the future?
"Maybe if some of these people turned in their $75,000.00 trucks they could afford food.. covid benefits?? Come to ny and complain. Go work!!!"
"People driving to food distribution in completely brand new cars, I mean some of them may have fallen on hard times, but some i'm quite doubtful of."
"Getting healthy food should be a health insurance voucher, not gov't/religious charity programs. It will encourage people to be healthier and reduce illness. Oh, that goes against the profit model for the AMA, hospital systems, and insurance companies."
"Okay, but who did they vote for? None of them deserve this, but I doubt the majority voted anything opposite of GOP. given it's Kentucky."
Alarming
Learn how to grow your own vegetables. These people need nutrients not more food
Shame on  the Kentucky politicians and others throughout  the country who are blind to the needs of their own constituents and neglect to help them with their basic needs.
"41 million people get SNAP benefits?  That is 1 in 9 people, yet I have no clue where they go to sign up.  Is there some government office someplace like Social Security or the DMV?"
Pathetic! The rich and bought off politicians have got to end.
"there is a lot of people abusing these programs, lying about income, people living in the house that work, and there are people that can afford food but are just cheap. These programs should  be for disabled people, the elderly that are on a fixed income, people that cant work because they are taking care of a disabled person, single parents that really are single parents. its a joke really there is so much waste and corruption with welfare, edd, snap, child support, medical etc"
"How you in line for free food but drive a $50,000 F150?  Seriously"
what percentage of these people are voting for people who are cutting their benefits
So much Obesity amongst the Staving people of America.
What is the Covid-related mortality for non-elderly persons with no comorbidities???
whu dont u ask these people if they vote for rep ? some1 sure do
"I am confuse who can drive two hours there and back, but can't put food on the table. Bless their hearts for what they are doing, but I am a bit confused on this process."
We have had a big rise in food bank use in the UK too.  Our governments are failing us.
But we have money for Ukraine.
What kind people.  I wish our elected representatives were the same.
Aside from those who were born with special needs and disabilities. Those do need help with food and financial assistance. Don't blame hustlers who are trying to making a better life for themselves. Blame your GOD DAMN SELF! to not want to better your life. Third world countries are wayy more poor and worst poverty every. They at least try to survive by growing their own food and go look for food. Most of these fawkin people are lazy asf!!!
No wonder they cant afford food when you see how fat all are and the drugs in their eyes with sodas
They mentioned it in the comments already....but I'm here to mention it again it's good that they are doing this but what about the people who don't have a car......Where's the help for them? Not everyone can afford a car and some had to sell their car to get by......They need help too!
"Don't worry our prostitutes in DC congress and the house will feast tonite and throw away food, don't worry we will eat F35's for dinner as we keep increasing military spending budget, don't worry our politicians will give them selves raises with bipartisan approval, keep spending the taxpayers dime as if there is no tomorrow. The only thing D&R can agree on is bipartisan screwing of the American people. Not mention billions in us aid giving around world and higher taxes and hunger for Americans."
Richest country in the world with freedom this one.
"Dang, it sounds like a state government problem, but they're not ready to have that conversation."
The overabundance of food is starting to catch up
God bless these food pantry folks.
And yet these people keep voting in the same people that are cutting their benefits. Go figure.
"Make no mistake, the food and grocery industry is profiting via price gouging while millions suffer. Money keeps flowing to the top, reporting record profits in many cases, while modern bread lines take shape. Shared sacrifice seems like a dead concept. Capitalism has run its course."
Thank you Vice for recognizing that there are impoverished whites in this world.
Guarantee half of these people have 1000 dollar I phones
Pandemic? What pandemic? Everyone wants to pretend the damage of last three years never happened.
I love how the guy wearing a $50 dollar Carhartt Tshirt is saying he can't buy food
It seems that vice only makes terrible left wing takes
"I'm from India. I can't comprehend this situation, this is the US right? The world superpower. Powerhouse of tech and innovation. How is this happening in the US?"
"im tired of my tax dollars going to these broke people. Kentucky is a red state, dont they hate socialism?"
Impeach fraudster Biden
In the so called richest country in the world but their bringing people in from other countries instead of sending them to their closest country next to them and we have extreme poverty and crisis here hypocrites
"Votes against public assistance, surprise pikachu face it sucks when they need it"
LMFAO!!!!!
Lololololololol!!!
Jajajaja!!!
"Where is Rand and McConnell? Oh right, busy tending to the needs of big corporate donors."
She said tayturs good lord give them some education
"Republicans should be happy, No free handouts..."
its so so sooo sad to see this and to know many of these people vote for people that ultimately make their lifes a lot worse.
"Everybody is driving a big car, and all the fuel wasted idling. You shouldbhave spend the money on food instead"
"We miss the Trump days.. Everyone had food, work and cheap gas. #Trump2024"
That box of cakes and donuts cause more disease and obesity!!! Seriously? Americans are lacking NUTRIENTS... adequate minerals and vitamins...not calories.
"The overweight middle aged man waiting for food mentions milk and meat...he needs neither!! Adults don't need milk!!! Only babies do! It's toxic garbage anyway...pus, hormones, other nasty stuff in milk!! Most meat is just as bad !!! America needs to EDUCATE THEMSELVES!! GUARANTEE MOST OF THESE PEOPLE ARE ON MEDICINES TO COMBAT THE EFFECTS FROM THE GARBAGE THEY EAT !!!"
But they continue to vote for republicans. Idiots
I clicked on this video expecting to be lectured on how corn is racist. What happened vice? you were cool once.
They got another 300 billion for war but can not feed our poor.
Biggly people
The fact that you take everybody explains why you run out of stuff early... you should probably focus on the people actually in need. Your imaginary sky friend has nothing to do with literal real life human beings living and breathing on this planet that need help.
Feed Americans first!!! No more money to the Ukrainians!!!
If all state assembly members in Kentucky take a small 3% pay cut they can feed the whole state. Problem solved.
"Food costs remain high and although the government keeps saying job growth is a thing, it is extremely difficult to find those good paying jobs outside of poison fast food service jobs. No one should have to work 3 jobs to make ends meet."
"Instead of giving the military an additional 300 billion toward their spending budget the US should try and allocate those funds towards infrastructure, social security benefits, government subsidy programs, lgbtq groups and social programs, trying to get all homeless people off the street, investing in black and brown neighborhoods, stockpiling food pantries, rehabilitation and reeducation over incarceration, HIV awareness, children's hospitals and programs and disaster relief funds for people devastated by storms or toxic spills such as the derailment in Ohio. The US needs to take a step back and figure out why there are so many problems in the richest country on earth. Capitalism has completely destroyed politicians minds so that they are just puppets for corporations now."
A bunch of people who can afford car but can't afford food is a very weird concept for me. Some of those seems to be nice cars too
"So many millionaires and billionaires while people go hungry. This country should be ashamed. Especially all of the ""representatives"" that sellout the interests of everyday people for their own interests and those of the ultra wealthy."
No doubt! Everything is too expensive these days!
Remember how they always say that we don't need social programs because charities and churches or whatever
"I admire the good work this food pantry is doing, and i think to add to it perhaps extension offices can provide education and resources so these people can start growing some of their own food.  Please know in saying this I'm not accusing these people of not taking the initiative themselves, because it's a culture/ community mindset that needs to be changed to allow these solutions to become more attainable."
"As a non-American, it is very peculiar to see poor ppl in cars waiting in food lines."
"Ah Kentucky, bastion of voting against their interests but keeping the racism strong and alive. You get what you deserve. Still loving Trump, are ya?"
Government to busy helping illegal immigrants
"My close friend works for the ""State"" Welfare office. I could never do his job. People act like it's him taking the food stamps himself"
white people with no  food...holy
"Hey Vice, how does it feel going bankrupt?"
why is everyone fat lol or over weight lol
"We can blame this all on Biden, because when trump was in office I had enough food with my ebt card to last me a month and now with bidens price hikes because he let the whole border in really fucked us, he gave all our money to non Americans and blames everyone but himself,  and he had more game than his crackhead children"
big fat guys sobbing shut up
hows bankrutpcy going XD?
Meanwhile...Mitch mcconnell
Red states are the biggest welfare guzzlers but keep voting Trump
"SHOULD have asked each of them who they voted for and asked them if they knew that persons voting record on support for families like this.  Because I bet most of them voted against their own interests, and voted for someone that wants to cut benefits."
"Well, guess what? Your elected senator Mcconnell helped get rid of food stamps. Maybe you should thank him for taking the food off your table."
The number of people visiting our church food bank has doubled since benefits have been cut.
I hope that woman working doesn't feel too bad about not having enough. Some of these people actually go and sell the food
That lady is an absolute saint
Keep Voting MAGA!!.....LOL
Universal basic income is the solution. A.I. will make it so.
"just an honest question - why do all of these people need free food?  I understand the poor woman with 4 kids, and other like her, but the line of cars was over a mile long they said.  Is there a bigger problem that needs to be fixed here?"
"Anyone else notice some of the cars in line are 20k trucks? Maybe some of them got a ride, but let's I doubt it's all."
Thanks Trump
"Every time a republican starves to death, an angel gets a boner"
"Get ready America. This is just the start of your children going hungry. 
Prep up hard ""now"" while you can. 
Biden is a guaranteed winner next election. You should not be surprised at the 300 billion to Ukraine, open boarders, 200 billion foreign aid, unaffordable health insurance, and MUCH, MUCH higher interest rates for your mortgage coming soon.  
We will have food lines that triple this with our short supply chain. 
Just wait. It's coming. Prepare."
if you voted for trump you should be cut off from all assistance
Democrats know this will help them come elections 2024 time and will blame Republicans for the problem.
the 1% are guilty of crimes against humanity. there's nothing that could be done to them that they wouldn't deserve.
"To those who are saying it is the peoples fault for voting for one party over the other, who should they vote for then? Look at the cities run by democrats. I live in California where in order to rent an apartment you need to make x4 the rent. A 3 bedroom is easily 3k+ a month so you do the math. People who are working fulltime jobs can't afford housing, They don't qualify for ebt, gang violence, poverty, and drug addiction is on every street corner. It isn't the party, it is the fact that these people DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE AVERAGE PERSON. Democrat, Republican, they do not care about you. Your suffering and your lives are a game to them. Continuing to play party politics is willingly playing a game that enables THEM to divide US, the people. I'm wishing these people the best. Life is hard for everyone right now."
They talking about not having enough food when they 300lbs over weight
Are we helpless man
Lazy azzezz
Let the government raise your kids really sucks
Their grown men come on
You keep saying you why
Hold up some people collecting food had 30-50K cars. Umm. I have a $10K car. I think a lot of this is people not making educated decisions financially
Ohio did this in February with 30 days notice
"I have never personally been in a situation were not having lots of groceries was a thing. This seems like a third world situation, not like something in my backyard. What an eye-opener."
VOTE VOTE VOTE
I'm definitely going this month
Republicans will fix this by giving more to the rich to speed up the trickle down.
"If you watch these people and need to find yourself resentful because they're getting help, and you never did, please understand that you're a person of value, just like the people in line are. The question,  ""why wasn't I good enough to help?"" Is valid, because I've asked that same question myself. But the people in line didn't take anything from you. They're not the ones who failed you. You were worth saving, just like they are. I'm sorry you had to save yourself. But if we already saved ourselves, maybe we can be the people that save others. I want to be the person that always has a little extra food to give to others when someone asks. Because the rising tide lifts all boats."
Without watching the video. My guess is this is happening in a red state.
"40 seconds in, guy had plastic bag over his head. Is that normal?"
They should survey the people in these lines on their political views and who they voted for.
"The take-away from this is ""Don't have kids unless you can provide for them out of your own pocket"""
"""Jesus didnt check someones pantry before feeding them, he just fed them."" Anything more complicated than that is just someone trying to justify their own ego, anxieties and prejudices."
The fruits of our school system and parents teaching subservience and conservatism for generations.
"None of them look starving, most look obese, they all have cars too. I would advise walking and eating less to avoid expensive medical treatment in later life based on their present terrible like choice"
Genuinely curious how these people vote.
She's a sweetheart.  Thank you so very much for your efforts and ability to find resources for these folks.
Please go bankrupt already
We give billions and billions to foreign countries when people here in the United States are starving for food.   We need to take care of our own first and not the rest of the world.
"Richest country in the history of the world, cant provide its own people with food and fresh water. MURICA!"
You need to vote Dems. They make you fully dependent on the gov. And you can also play the victim card for bonus benefits. Just identify with the correct skin color.
"maybe stop throwing away on the Ukraine war, and give that taxpayer money back to the American taxpayer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Thank you for being the humanity we cannot seem to get from our legislators that claim to be for the people... You all are amazing and gracious xo
Great job everyone MoneyTeamXXII
"A very sad reality is there are likely people sitting in that line that don't really NEED the food assistance who are taking it from people that do. 
Those people who choose to go get their nails done or buy cigarettes or alcohol with their cash knowing they can get free food here. Those are the ones that prevent the people at the back of the line that do really need the food assistance to go without... It's more common that you'd think."
The US has to stop funding wars in other countries and use that money here in the US.
"The food bank in this film is in Wolfe County, Kentucky. 
Which has 4219 Registered democratic voters and 993 Republicans. 

Despite this fact, the majority of these voters have chosen Republican candidates over Democratic ones in the last two presidential races and senate races. 

This is confusing, why would people who need social welfare programs like SNAP vote for leaders that want to reduce these benefits?

"The greatest country in the world has people struggling to eat...
I don't believe this is the greatest country in the world"
"which is odd, since the Dems have the Whitehouse, and had control of the House up until a year ago.  Seems they'd rather run on the issues, rather than think ahead and fix em. Seems there's little incentive to actually fixing problems nowadays. But SNAP ending prematurely ? makes for a good issue to run on. Disgusting."
You people literally voted in a few years ago a gov who pardoned a man who chopped up his wife. Screw you KY
"$95. really helped, trying to eat on $250. means lots of potatoes and beans."
I need me a food paintree
For over 2 years now I have been receiving $20 of ebt from the state and $200 from the federal government. Now I'm down to $3 on my card. Time to start shoplifting again.
"Hmmm, seems a lot like a mile long breadline to. Yay capitalism!"
A lot of people in very new and fairly new cars there.... and trucks that drink a lot of diesel. Can't afford to eat? Start with trading in your vehicle for a smaller more efficient one.
"How can you say you're poor when you have a nice car? If you're sick it's different, but some of the people looked like they can work, but I don't know everyone..."
"Uhhh... Hello? Kentucky's senators are freaking MITCH MCCONNELL and RAND PAUL
One is a spineless snake. Kentucky re-elected him in 2020
The other is an anti mask and anti vaccine ophthalmologist who didn't blink an eye as people died of covid. Kentucky re-elected him in 2022
Choices have consequences"
In a land of plenty this is fkg disgusting tax the rich feed the poor
Wealthiest country in the world. Its pathetic.
1.16 How is that ever legal to be on the road? It looks like something out of Mad Max.
"Kentucky Derby, noun: describing a mile or longer line of cars filled with hungry people that cannot afford food."
"This food pantry they show isn't even funded by the government either. It's funded by a local church. If we don't replace the ENTIRE government soon, we WILL end up like all the other poor countries in the world."
"the crazy part is the ""extra"" was the normal back in 2009. They have done nothing but cut food stamps for 12+ years. THe max you can get in my state is 186$ when eggs are 15$ lmao"
"You'd be better off just giving out the extra SNAP benefits, otherwise all that unpurchased food just goes to waste anyway. Its just trashed. That way people can still eat and those food companies manufacturing the
 chips, cookies, pizzas,  sodas  and all that other junk they call food can still make the money."
Stop voting for rand paul and mitch mcconnel! You people deserve better. God Bless!
"McConnell/Trump folk?

Very sad."
"from a european perspective, it's strange that all those people still own cars and can afford to drive them. I don't think we even have drive-thru food distribution in germany, since most of the people who would need the free food have no cars."
"USA looks 3rd world. How can you be the richest nation with this much inequality and poverty? Oh right, because majority of the money are held by a select few hundred while the rest goes to defense spending and giving free money to other countries."
The failure of rampant capitalism!
"If they can drive, they got money for gas. GET A JOB YOU LAZY BUNCHKINS! Even a simple Walmart stocker or cashier or bagger pays and you don't have to do all that much.

"The richest country in the world propagating market based economy and not taxing billionaire friends while the less fortunate ones lurch on the roads... Sometimes all you need is a bit of socialistic outlook to policies... And yes, extreme of everything is bad..."
"Ok, so will my taxes go down now?"
How many of those people have jobs? They obviously have transportation...
We need to help our own citizens we can't even help them and you want to let fucking illegals in ha
"Although citizens are cut off from benefits, the newly arrived migrants will receive full benefits.   Robert Kennedy Jr. 2024."
