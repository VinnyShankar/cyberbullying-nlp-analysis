The work culture in japan is incredibly toxic. Shame it was not brought up more.
It would be better if Turkish subtitles were added.

For someone who doesn't work anywhere would be ideal

"I've lived in Japan for five months, and I also experienced that feeling when you suddenly appreciate something small in daily life."
"Pewds seem so peaceful and content at this point of his life and I'm all for it. Happy for you and Marzia, and the soon baby boy!"
When u are loaded where ever u go its a nice place
Would love to move to Japan but I cant see that to be a good decision.
"Reason they dont know you:
1. Work life balance is terrible that they dont even have even time to find mates
2. Due to above there are more old people now."
12:14 serenity or peace maybe?
You're a tall white man. Of course Japanese like foreigners if they look like you
"PewDiePie, do you live in Japan? I love Japan"
I'm really upset there wasn't a spolier tag. Really spoiled the story of Japan for me
PEWDIEPIE WHY DIDNT YOU TAKE ME WITH YOU TO JAPAN
Fun fact Felix: Japanese is simplified Chinese to an ungodly lvl. So if you try to learn Chinese your fucked for sure lmao
"The rule thing sucks but is awesome at the same time, same happened to me here in Taiwan"
6:07
Japan enforcing Covid in Summer 2023 is laughable. What the fuck is going on with their politics? Is this a regional phenomenon?

PewDiePie should have more subs than 111 mil
"I am Japanese and live in Japan, so I have no idea what is good about Japan.
I don't have the courage to go abroad.I think it's difficult due to language problems."
The last reason is because you fantasize about japan
your my fav youtuber i come from oknowa its too bad i did not see you but i love japan too
"Kudos to you for creating such valuable content. It's evident that you're passionate about this topic, and it shows in your writing."
i want book review
Hello 
respect from Japan<3
I think you should do cone t shirt. xDDD
"Imagine how multilingual and multicultural BabyPie would be.

""I'm half Italian, half Swedish, but my nationality is Japanese"""
it's weird having a feeling of closeness to a youtuber(pdp) even if you haven't met him in real life.
"so i once tried to do the hashi watashi between my japanese mother and myself, thinking nothing of it (while in japan and in public) and my mother informed me that its wrong because after japanese people die and they are cremated (which is the norm there), people pick up the bones with chopsticks and put em in a box. which i feel like i shouldve known, since ive done it before. so now i know what not to do while in japan :D"
Are you crazy PewDiePie you from Sweden
"So you are learning Japanese as an English speaker?
Big brain"
"You should familiarize with the law, especially the defamation one. Talking fact about bad stuff of a person still might make you pay for the damage caused.

How's the siren due to north korea though?"
Yes i am brazilian and you?
Warm wind doesn't sound as refreshing as cool wind lol
"I feel like im in the minority of disliking japanese culture/vibe. Many of them still seem to have the mindset of them being the superior ""race"" and they seem very closed off. I think they have way too much censorship as well"
Happy For you Pewds
I truly love your channel. Keep doing the best work
I watch last of us when I was 5 I am 15 now thank pewds
Tokura
"I'm glad that someone with as much influence as you has expressed positive feelings about Japan. While there may be various rules and regulations that could be seen as cumbersome to people from other countries, Japan is fundamentally a wonderful nation. Thank you for appreciating it!"
Thankyou!! from Japanesestudent
"I'm Japanese, but I really sympathize with the 2:40  thing."

"As a half japanese grew up in japan and lived there about 19,20 years, i can relate to him so hard lol"
it feels like youve been havnig the tourist experience for a year.
"You found your ikigai, Felix. Thats so amazing:)"
"I can just feel that this video is edited by pewdiepie, its jsut far more entertainig :)"
Imagine having pewdiepies life. He lives like a god amongs cockroaches like us. What a life.
"For foreigners, Japan may be a good country to come as a tourist, but it's a different story when it comes to living.

Even I, a Japanese, think that there are too many unspoken rules.

I hate it because there are a lot of meaningless manners.

But Japan is clean, the food is delicious, and there is no doubt that the security is good compared to other countries."
Cones have become the new barrels.
bro i need that animated cat
pewds got skinnier in japan
Awesome! We love u Pewds - Swedish guy
"Pewdiepie, beloved swed. Why the hell is your audio so horrible. Please fix your mic quality NOW // swed 2"
I like how pewds these days looks like he found his balance in life. He looks so content and peaceful. Cheers mate happy for you pewds.
The legend says even after 10000 years he didn't pass 111milion subcribers
1 year since my first hospitalization too I'm I'm big anime fan so  it's obvious I'd love to see Japan thanks for the vlogs pewds

"Japan has its own dimensions and proportions compared to Europe, for simplicity, and I admire mostly the aesthetics of reduction to the essentials while having an appreciation for quality. Then mangas..."
"Everyone wants to live in Japan until you have to actually work a real job (Not English Teaching) in Japan. Youtubers give an unobtainable version of Japan for 99% of people, including Japanese people."
I'm going to Japan next year
"Whoa, Pewds is a climber? I hear the climbing gyms in Japan are next level. Would love to get your take on the climbing scene in Japan. My wife and I are planning a trip there next year."
"In Japan, you can throw your trash at any convenience stores."
I think pewds accent has changed over the year..or is it that he has started talking with his nore
Why people that lived in the UK experience traveling or moving abroad like being released from prison
Me not getting a chance to be weird to pewds damn
You know you'll never be a Japanese citizen tho
Congrats on becoming a dad Pewds!
Everyone in Japan is welcoming. Come ooooon.
<3
The animal crossing cone thing took me out haha
"Maybe it is my East-European mind - but it is possible that rules about covid and childbirth are made for some kind of corruption opportunity. 
I mean, many people would agree to pay considerable money to be allowed to be present at childbirth. 
I think this is exactly what is meant in phrases ""there gotta be a way"". 

I am not encouraging to engage in bribes for medical workers, of course. 
I am just saying, that if the rules don't make sense by themselves - you should find who would benefit from either implementation of such rule OR circumvention of such rule."
video already started and i already agree with the absence of trash bins.
"wants to be famous .. gets mad when he is famous

the typical european experience lmao what a joke"
Now you know why VLC is the most used media player  in Japan.
"I had limited time with my baby in the delivery room because of covid too Felix. Its poopy, but i know when the time comes youll do great!"
"2012 Pewdiepie: Barrels

"this is the first pewdiepie video I've watch.

Damn i like how pewdiepie has been devoluping over the years and how he has grown as an person and become better and his content has been more funny and interesting and i feel like that he knows what his goals are in life and that he is happy with his life in Japan but i miss the old pewdiepie.
I SMILED! STOP YELLING AT ME!
How does Marzia enjoy Japan?
Japan's low crime rate is extraordinary.
"does it feel like ""home"" allready or still like a verry long trip? ;-)"
Never bought merch from a YouTuber before until now wtf
Gaijin Yakuza!
why there's a slice of sadness on the pewds face ?
Be careful of earthquakes and typhoons
"I almost spit out my drink with the cones bit. Absolutely hilarious.
Having lived in Japan 15+ years, I can say that many of the cones are there to keep someone out of a certain spot without the need to warn or confront them.

There is a myth that Japanese people are loathe for confrontation. It's not always true, but there are some situations when it is.
Say you owned a small business, located on a street near a bar. And every single evening, the bar's patrons would exit and decide to congregate at a certain spot in front of your business for an hour or so, talking and laughing loudly, maybe even deciding to use your wall as a toilet. Well, they might take the hint and go somewhere else if you throw a few cones up lol. And look at that, you didn't even have to go outside and start yelling at them (confrontation avoided).

It works on animals too. Maybe a certain stray cat likes to poo in a certain spot near your house every day. Sometimes placing a barrier there will cause the cat to find a new spot, without you having to, uhhh, confront the cat I guess. I know cats don't understand cones, but they can work like a scarecrow. The very presence of the cone being there when it wasn't before, might ward the cat off. That's also why you will see CDROMs hanging from some people's windows, or sometimes from places in kid's parks and stuff. They supposedly ward away crows (personally, I doubt that works, but people here tell me it works).

I also think that cones get put up after something that the Japanese consider to be anti-social happens. For example, you might see a random tree in a little park get roped or coned off. It might be because someone crapped there, or carved something into the tree, or something like that. Even though it was probably a one-time event, the cones just get put up and stay forever lol."
"the feeling pewds mention is spot on. even though i worked hard when i lived there and work was stressful for some specific reasons i will not mention, life outside of work was awesome. i had a few japanese friends and felt many moments of utter peacefulness which i seldom feel here when i go out- especially in public. The united states is a great country to work in but there is much violence, vulgarity and lack of genuine concern for human welfare especially for the sick, aging and disabled"
"Well, there's even more cones in Montreal..."
welcome to the dad club
Karl you rock
"The question he raises is one that not a few Japanese have asked themselves. As a Japanese, I agree with most of his answers
One thing I think is that many people are not interested in other languages and feel bad when they hear them.
But of course there are many friendly people out there."
"Well, we just watched a 30 year old retire. Hurry up slacker millenials."
I still dont get it. He stopped working. Period. Why Japan? He likes having a challenge every day going to grocery.
I really want to go to Japan but there is no money at all
arigatou pews
"I came to japan recently and theres unfortunately a lot of misunderstanding between how open the people are here. Im staying with another host student whos from taiwan and he doesnt speak japanese or english. The day after we landed we were walking around nearby and went to a small sushi restaurant owned by an older couple (maybe 80). They were extremely welcome and regardless of what stereotypes say, they were very friendly to me and my roommate and they were very interested in talking to us. People here are usually very friendly and i have not had any issues with the people. Another example is my roommate wanted to use a tourist discount at a store nearby and the workers didnt know how to do it. We were holding up the line and i felt kinda bad so i told them that it would be ok if they couldnt do it since the line was stacked up. They declined my offer and decided to go through with it even though it took a lot of extra time and then THEY apologized for an inconvenience that we more or less caused. These things are all small ik, but they make a huge difference and regardless of what people say about japan its really a place you have to experience and connect with to understand. Whats seen vs reality is very different and i think its a very welcoming place."
"I just came back from my first month in Japan. and you're exactly right. I also believe Japan has conditioned its people to fear cones. it's a culturally ingrained thing. they see one, they turn away."
this video makes me wanna visit Japan more <3
Please Dear pewdiepie help me
"if you think japan has too many cones, then you should see New Zealand.. im surprised Nz didnt invent them"
I'm interested in the language. I think you could make a series of videos about learning Japanese. It would be very valuable and interesting seeing you progress with the language skills.
"I figure most Japanese people are fine with people moving to Japan and integrating, at least in small numbers."
cones are the new barrels for felix
"This guy went from cringe, to kinda funny for awhile, then back to Weeb cringe. Really?? Japan? XD Nuke em again, plz"
haha
No trash bins???
"12:20 There is a word for it, its called having no enemies"
I remember going to Subway in Osaka and not getting a straw for my drink because I didn't want one and a random Japanese woman got me one anyway
the thumbnail
"whichever country has some kind of ""rules"" for Covid of the plandemic, that rule is 100% stupid."
If you hate cones you might not like Montreal XD
What about non-freelancers?
pewdiepie is so right about the giant playground
Thank you
:^)
"fuck the rules pewdie, lead the way! (at least the covid related ones)"
5:58 My philosophy in a nutshell
At Ikebukuro station I've seen drunk puking people be surrounded by cones the staff placed to stop others from walking on them. As if we can't see them?
that feeling sounds like bliss
"10/10 review, more cones."
Examples of difficult kanji are not known to the Japanese
"Congratulations!!
You'll enjoy a boring Japan in ''obonyasumi'' with baby."
Meet HIKAKIN
Wait the cone thing is true tho. I have a seven eleven near my house in Kyoto and they placed BUNNY CONES against A WALL. WHAT IS THE CONE FOR. The worst part is that they just placed it there and forgot about it. ITS BEEN THERE FOR YEARS.
12:00 the word you're looking for is the sublime
Already a year what
I just bought the shirt he wears in the video because it is EPIC!!
"Your Japanese is so  goodddddd!!! Lol 
Nice Japanese pronunciation!"
Aku orang Indonesia cocok dekade kabaret gue cowok wa anjing bagaimana bahasa Amerika aku keren kan

"Now we know, that the reason vlogs feel so calming and like a dream (at least for me) is that Felix really does feel like that living in Japan. Good luck man!"
Its already been a year?
I think u would Korea too
"12 years living here, and I love how his list of good and bad mirrors experience here from arrival to having been here for awhile. The trash bins you notice almost immediately. The language hurdles and small victories over time. The rules one is spot on though. If it is written, or generally understood & accepted to be, it means that is how it is and there will be no other way. I am so happy for you both, on both your life and work change, and for your new additions."
"Serene, dreamlike, its an out of body type of experience, an opening of the mind due to new sourounding, and its feels amazing 12:10 could be more reasonings too, mainly serene though, in those moments feeling more at one with himself and where/who he is and where hes standing"
Could you have a home baby?
0:10 it says raid japan
Love that you made this change for you and your Family and that it worked out tremendously well! So glad the both of you seem so much happier you were meant to be living where ever your heart wants! 
"Everyone knows after 2hrs in the delivery room COVID becomes extra super COVID and infects people at a rate 10-20x the normal rate , it's science."
Every country has its struggle. You either live well or work hard.
"how can you even think of offending cones, that's unacceptable, listen to the words of yozora blues, the cone prophet, and learn to love cones in all their shapes and colors.
cones
cones
cones"
"weirdest thing to me was how none of the freight trains had any graffiti on em, it was super bizarre to see but obvi super normal to the locals lol

such an amazing place tho full of culture and beauty i can't wait to make it back"
You genuinely look happy now Pewds. You look at peace.
"Wtf, since when does Pewdiepie climb?? Neato."
I learnt Japanese by watching anime.
No UwUs?
"In Japan, there's so called ""cone fairies"" that puts cones where drunk salary-men have puked once so that people wouldn't step on it. If you put cones in your amazon wishlist, people will send you hundreds of cones for lucky charm."
Attack of the Cones
i get those happy feelings thinking about that life in japan but then reality hits im stuck here in the same spot for the past 9 years LOL one day for sure though even if its when im old
Great video but the video editing is just too childish
Fun fact: he is in japan
Have you ever tried Mandelbrot Fractal zooms yet? That's all I have.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA :)
"First it was barrels and now, its the cones"
He experiences Japan as a rich person with no job.
The fact I reacted 0.3 seconds after pewds said SMILE BACK
Anyone else notice Pewds progressively sounding more and more like Squidward?
"Sorry but who is editing this, the direspectful images being used weirds me out"
isnt there so many japanese people in japan? :S
"Even with a child on the way, your adventuring days aren't anywhere near finished. You just have a new party member to experience it with you."
Prop hunt irl: cone edition
"I think the japanese call it Ikaigai...the art of mindful and peaceful living...enjoying the flowers, the mountains, smell the air, etc....Ikaigai"
PewDiePie touched grass and can never go back...hehe...go on ya... contentment and peace feels good
"I think the word you're looking for is euphoria. Glad you enjoy Japan so much, I can't wait to get out there at some point!"
"I completely understand that ""feeling"" you're referring to at the end. In 2015 I went on a high school exchange to Japan for a year and lets just say my arrival in Japan was very stressful. Because of all that stress I went through I began regretting my decision to study abroad and was feeling really bad. After my host family at the time picked me up from the airport and I was in the car on the way to their home, I had a change of heart. What made me change my outlook was simply seeing life going on around me. I saw a person riding their bike, other cars on the road with us, all the homes in my host family's neighborhood and all that made me think ""you know what, this is nice"" and I never regretted my decision again after that. I ended up loving my year in Japan so much that I plan to move back in a few years."
12:34 this just confirms my thoughts as well
Starting to watch pew
"A year!! Time flies! As a Japanese, so glad to hear that he is having peaceful life in Japan!"
Wah I just knew that he's moved to Japan!Wah!!!
Go to Argentina there are basically no rules jajaja
Wow
The mini lamp is in the background
"As Japanese, I also think some rules are so misunderstanding."
I hope one day we get a Japan meme review. I enjoy these life like videos they are interesting and wonderful. Cool video. ^_^
"I am glad you are enjoying living here. We used to have trash cans everywhere until a religious cult made terrorist attacks on the Tokyo subway system in 1995. In order not to have suspicious objects left in public places, we have removed trash cans."
Just came back from 4 months in Japan and I'm my eyes Felix hit the nail on the head with this one
"There is a reason why there are so few trash cans in Tokyo.  In 1995, a terrorist attack by a cult group occurred in Tokyo."
5:56 ~ yearbook quote right there.
Nice video
Comes are the new barrels
weeb
"Number 3 works well because its 98.6% Japanese in Japan. Which freaks out the BBC and Hollyweird crowd big time. Cannot be good because diversity is the way, we tear down what you like and replace it with what we like. Japanese are also very friendly but those ""people"" you mentioned saying they are bad, are usually those types that want to tear it down. Pretend its not true but fact is, it is true. Then those types start calling names and all that, babbling nonsense and causing trouble. So hopefully Japan doesn't fall for the lies and stay as they are, like most western countries are doing."
CONE GANG!
If a rule a different country don't make sense. Please don't complain about it. You can go back to your country. Please stop spreading your dumb ideas
"Trust me you're gonna be glad that rule exists.  You do not wanna be in the delivery room for more than 2 hours.  Back in the 50s men weren't allowed in at all.  Watching your wife give birth is not something you wanna see, it's very disgusting and you won't look down there the same way again if you know what I mean DONT LOOK TRUST ME"
"Love the videos, Felix. Keep it up!!!"
pewds is my therapist
What a great review.
pew is a lie. tell Americans that in Japan your never a citizen. white males are second class residence
"Your wife can give birth at home. You can just have a nurse or doctor or both on call for when it happens and make preparations for everything that needs to be in place at that time and you can be there because it is your home. Also, perhaps consider homeschooling. Thank you for sharing."
Cones are the new barrels
Those are chinese characters!

"once you have a kid, actually a bunch of things open up for you. you get to take your kid to all the kiddo stuff! it can be fun, it's a myth that when you get a kid you run out of things to do, it opens up more stuff :)"
Hello. Many colored cones are installed so that visually impaired people can walk safely. I think it's set up as an emergency measure.
How long are covid rules going to continue?! I mean everyone is vaccinated and it's been years. There are other diseases we aren't this paranoid about. Let Felix stay in the hospital with Marzia ffs
"This is something $40,000,000 can do."
"I'm married to an American lady and she was definitely surprised with etiquette rules in public. prior to COVID, wearing mask in public was not something she'd seen in the US. And people wear masks from allergies to having a cold. 
I always tell people Japan is a great place to visit. good review."
I actually smiled back and caught myself doing it after a sec haha
"Japan: Think about others 
America: Me, myself and I"

"I can't even imagine having to move to another country just to enjoy the simple pleasure of waking outside or going shopping. I'm so happy for them, keep enjoying yourselves."

With such a shallow voice they think your gay
"For some reason, people love talking shit about Korea and Japan even though they have never gone or lived there. Their conception of these countries are completely formed by media."

Is PewDiePie cone available?
Now we need a cone review
"for foreigners Japan is like something that puts them at ease? that's good to know. I have no clue why a lot of Japanese people commit suicide. personally I guess Japanese government is corrupted, which gives negative thoughts to people. as Japanese I feel depressed whenever I see news about how terrible Japanese government is."
Do you still have that squid car from the Dislike vid
"PewDiePie in other words: ""I enjoy being irrelevant in the japanese society"" xD"

Believe Pn Jesus Christ And You Will Be Saved
"Pewds i am proud of you I've been here from 20k subs, you did it you made your milions so u don't need to worry in your life anymore, and that's the reasoning why you are not making no more videos, just wanted to say that you are the GOAT of youtube and you will allways be THE GOAT!  But if you ever to make videos, please play horror games, these videos out of 50k of your videos were allways most funniest shit and they gave me energy when life was tough thanks, Pewds! You deserve everything you reached !"
I am surprised it has been a year already :O
"Feeling depressed, Might need some bitch lasagna."
Can you make a video where you study japanese? might be a cool idea!
Trash where did
A happy pewds creates happy bros. Speaks this 45 yr old lady
HEY pew ! STOP PLAYING THOSE BABY ASS GAME LIKE MINECRAFT ALREADY play pizza tower !
When I first visited Japan we were still learning the subway station and of course we were in Shinjuku. This lady named AIko spent an hour and a half of her day helping us set up Passmo (buss pass) and explaining the subway system to us. She didn't speak much english but was still a huge blessing when we had no idea what we were doing.
good video
I am canceling you L+Ratio
Hard to believe Japan used to commit horrific war crimes against China and other countries/islands they invaded for resources in ww2
"Thank you for describing our country!
As Japanese, I totally agree with your opinion!
I had never think abont cornes. haha But actually we have a lot of chances to see it in daily life, on the road or in some facilities, especially schools.
I also think Japanese hesitate to change our rules, so sometimes I feel our culure has many wasteful things, but it conncet to our minds  to do it carefully. It's big arguments.
I enjoyed your comments, thank you. I hope you have wonderful time in Japan for long time."

F*** T-Series brother I'm hafe Indian
O felix
Start playing Minecraft. Then your subs will raise
Indonesia
"wondering Felix's MBTI at this moment, the status quo"
Japan is the best place to live but worst place to work
Most of complainers are generally negative mindset extremely low level of Japanese language proficiency.
The new merch looks sick
Your channel stuck in 111 Million subscriber
Such a lame  channel guy.
"2m people just smiled at pewds, lovely"
How long was felix demonetized?
you should try aquascaping. really cool scene in Japan
I love you so much.
"Wow,such a nice video uploaded."
The cones were the one thing about Japan I never heard anyone mention. I thought I just visited in the off season for tourism so everything was under construction. All the beautiful temples were covered in endless amounts of cones!
The best thing to know in every language is how to tell someone you don't know how to speak their language.
"makes me happy. I did not really watch PewDiePie to much before (sorry), but these videos are in a way easy to watch and helps me feel relaxed when I am stressing out and a"
Da goat
He should do the raw garlic challenge.
Please coffee-break
"Hello! I am commenting from Japan.
I watched your video for the first time.
I am very glad that you live in Japan.

The reason why you need road cones is so that you don't bump into people because Japan is so small. Probably.
Also, Japanese people are very shy, so I think the desire to have as little contact with people as possible, or to spend as much time as possible without fighting, is the reason why we have so many road cones.

I look forward to seeing more videos about Japan in the future."
Video summary: pewds touched grass finally
"Another thing that can be said is that, just as the Japanese language omits the subject, the Japanese way of thinking is not centered on oneself but on the environment first.
This is quite different from English, where the subject comes first and foremost.
Therefore, if there is a rule that we do not understand, we accept it.
This is because we respect the fact that the environment has been kept with those rules, and we imagine reasons that we do not see.
So the world is not all about what you understand. It is the Japanese way of thinking that even if a rule does not make sense to you, if it is a rule that is respected by the people in the place, you may respect it.
I hope this will be of some help to you in your life in Japan."
Japanese is so complicated to learn that even japanese kids have a hard time learning it. I failed a japanese class in college so I can say this with confidence.
Okay new game. We take a picture of each cone seen
I wish I had as many subs as you :)
It's been. Like ages since I watched a pewdiepie vid
so will his baby be a Japanese citizen or what??
"Wow, time has passed quickly! I was pleasantly surprised to hear that you have spent a year in Japan. Your honest review of Japan was much appreciated. As a Japanese person, I also love my country, but I do acknowledge that some customs might need to be changed. However, this could prove difficult as these customs have been protected for a long time. Regardless, I am grateful that you appreciate the beauty of our country. Thank you very much for your kind words.
ARIGATO"

"I'm an Italian studying Japanese at University. My professor found the best analogy to describe this language's difficulty: it's like Maths. Japanese truly is a hard language in the same way Maths is a hard subject for many people. If you're able to understand and memorise it's many rules and ways of expressing things, you're golden, but it's very hard to get the gist of it if you're mind is more optimised for something else. This other analogy is my own: kanji are like working out. You end up enjoying suffering and enduring because you get addicted to that sense of gradual growth and development you get when you achieve a new goal or milestone. In the end, kanji suck, but they're so much fun."
Speaking of Japan new anime update in minecraft
pewds in his 30s WOW!
CONES HAHAHAHAAHAHAHAH
"How do the Japanese view your ink? do they like it? or is it frowned upon.  I heard somewhere that tattoos were disliked when shown in public, I'm curious to know if there is any truth in that."
Hi
"Hmm, so Felix learns Japanese from English? Not his native language? Is that not odd?"
"As Japanese I agree your opinion. Japanese also feel the feeling like dream . For example, when It is sunny, early morning and so on.If you want tofeel that feeling, I welcome you to Japan."
"*Imam Ali said* : Be wary of every matter that degrades the one who performs
it when it becomes apparent, and abases him"
Finally someone mentions the abnormally huge amount of these damn cones!!!
the cones have been sent by the barrels
Why do we not milk unicorns?? Huh??
"11:40

This is because many Japanese feel that some people in an organization should not break the rules at their discretion.
In addition, if special permission is given, the line between what is allowed and what is not is drawn, so what is not allowed is not allowed, without exception."
Iconic bro fist
Pew is starting YouTube all over again

"This sounds exactly like Switzerland, you would love it here!"
Little does he realise he is living the dream
"LOL ""the trains run on time"" next shot is young men goosestepping

I see what u did there"
"It is true that there are many meaningless rules in Japan.
School rules are particularly strict.
In one school, there was a rule that ""hair must be black"", and originally brown hair had to be dyed black.
The media picked up on this and it became a hot topic."
"PewDiePie has this seasonal mandatory hating of a particular thing. Chairs, Barrels, Cones..."
We've come a long way floor gang.
Spoiler in Japan

Japan is perfect for a slow and contemplative life. Perfect for happiness (:
"Super cool PewDiePie! Sugoi! Today I felt like you visiting my daughter in school in Japan. The kids were very nice. (My daughter will just attend school for a week in Japan. We live in Sweden.)

We wish you and your wife the best of luck with the birth of your child.

Have a really nice day everyone!"

"Mr. Beast is better than you, because he's help people and you ??"
"Can't imagine how bizarre such a Hospital Rule must seem.
As a Man there is already such a strong shortage of sharing the toll on a Pregnancy.
Stay Str0nK, Mate and Happy Japan Aniversary, Samurai PewDiePie!"
Have the baby in Switzerland. My wife just gave birth here and it was a superb experience. No such rules.

PewDiePie you looks like A Hugo Lloris
AdenRoss shouted out the King Pewds in his stream
"Yes is better. Just small details (jumping of the cadre ""in"" end ""out"" is stupid) .You give verbal sentence in one motion, but you choose change the camera zoom in and out. Why? Just Why. Anyway, I'm surprised, well done. More reviews"
"Say what you want about the Japanese language... but man, it is beautiful."
Hopefully I'll visit Japan one day.
I love everyone who loves Japan!
omg its been a year. life is flying by
New banner is amazing
When u playing the new amnesia game?
yes we don't know you.
"You are delusional at best, living in Japan is cool as a millionaire, not dealing with Japanese's people and their work culture and society in general, it's like you describing a 1 year ultra rich holiday in Japan, which is not bad."
"the Smosh is back, i dont see the reason for u not to"
SIUUUUUUUU
garbage
Hi pewDiepie
Pewdiepie a you make a news game ro DLC tu plob and lak news game ?
"There are detailed rules for sure, but if you don't like them, you can leave Japan anytime you want.
And I think it is mostly people of Korean descent who speak ill of Japan.Because they always feel inferior to Japan.

Anyway, Japanese people welcome foreigners or aliens if they have a Japanese heart, but not if they don't. That's all."
Ei
Flop
12:15 You can start reciting haiku with those feelings
"Sometimes it is important to accept rules as rules themselves, as there can be people who can even be morally and ethically allowed to murder if they seek clear logic in the rules. I understand that it is tempting to seek reasons for rules."

Hello Nice 1 Year Japan Review sharing thank you
Gaming videos ple
"the dont like black and poor people, you are white and rich, thats why they welcomed you well
of course, there are exceptions, but they are very racist overall"
Wow Japan! It is probably amazing to live there.
Any Indian watching this video
Basically all the good stuff is related to the fact you've been famous for so long you're rediscovering what being able to be outside and happy feels like
New character but make him black then report back
12:20 I had this multiple times when I visited Japan it was absolutely insane
Pewds bring back the book review s
For me 100% the worst thing about japan that I always remember complaining about was that there were no trash cans absolutely anywhere D:
what happened to the japan vlogs? were they deleted?
Cones = the new barrels. Following everywhere.
you cleared up some thoughts. See you in japan <3
Play PewDiePie I'm playing your new game your new game is awesome
12:34 this is Sweden to me
"The number of suicides in Japan in 2022 totaled 21,881, an increase of 297 from the previous year. The suicide rate, or number of suicides per 100,000 people, increased by 0.8 to 17.5. This data was compiled by the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare based on statistics from the National Police Agency. 

Guess its nice to have all that dolla"
Share this to everyone
Plz come to jammu modi ji
"I visited Japan earlier this year and I DREAM of going back. The locals were very nice and patient. The food was some of the best I've had in so long, it made eating food from the states difficult when I got back.  The rural areas are so peaceful and beautiful too, especially with everything covered in snow. It was definitely hard to adjust returning to the US."
Mr Beast
His beef with the cones reminds me of the beef he had with barrels back when he played Outlast
"Hello, try to make a Minecraft survival video"
Cycuf
"When I was in Japan the elderly talked to me the most and were so incredibly friendly, even gave me gifts so I never experienced that stereotype either"
Minecraft PewDiePie please
Nice
I got a message from you... Was it real??? Please let me know it was in my spam. It was sent to zombie paint job please let me know it disappeared but it was there!!!!
From Barrels to now Cones
"I think the feeling you described has more to do with being rich than living in Japan, you don't have any worries, your life is completely settled, even your child's life is already settled, you don't have to struggle to pay the bills. And also you have the love of your life and on top of that she loves you back. Of course, your life seems like a dream, because it is. It's what everyone dreams about."
"Julien and Rome, said they had lunch with ya'll and then begged ya'll to help them do stuff"
0:19 is he bright god? pause to see it
why will you guys not get pewdiepie to 112M subs?
"Hope you and the missus are doing well, staying healthy and happy. Wish Marzia the best on forming bebe inside her oven.
*Create bebe? Make bebeh?*
Wish you 3, and your friends, much and many happy family times. Very wonderful times to come, a whole world of love and new memories ahead of you.
Pewdiepie family always loved by those of us who've grown up enjoying your content."
"It seems like one of the biggest the reasons you like it is because you are finally retired, happens in Japan."
the expieriences become even more special with a child. you see it through a totally new set of eyes. although there may be tears and tantrums. its worth it :) totally understand how upsetting it is to not be able to be in the delivery room too. my daughter was born in 2020 right amidst the covid outbreak. luckily my husband was allowed in but none of my family were.
Pewdiepie
I may not have many subs but I'm trying to make videos for my viewers
Pewds can you play Amnesia The Bunker?
"Hey pewds, This will probably be buried. But what happened to yamimash?"

"Everytime Felix shaves, my mind went straight back to 2014. Even as he gets old, he still look as young as he was 9 years ago,"
Why is it s+ not 10
I think pewdiepie is sponsored by Japan
very godd chanel bro
He got a large number of Subscribers but less than 1% of views on most of the Videos !
"2:25 at least, he is honest"
Cones are equivalent to barrels now.
"It has been a wild ride watching you for the past 5 years, being the same age. Specifically, seeing someone of your influence and wealth remaining grounded in your values. Thank you for all the content."
Why does pewds still have such a strong accent? He has lived in the usa for so long now.
"You living in the dream, but is it yours?"
we wanna video how piews climb !!!!!!! @pewdiepie
Lived in Tokyo for 7 months. Just realized you are totally correct about the cones! Different types... everywhere!
country review
:( it not the same I like well he played minecraft and more game
One thing I can't figure out since I moved to Japan: why do parking lots close
"wheres the bulk man? 
also i think your more happy because you stepped away from YT, it has its ups and downs but when it is your livelihood you focus on the negative and think how can i fix that on future videos. 
im just happy it worked out for one of the good ones."
Ngl felix is super cool
Unsubscribe PewDiePie
Come to MTL QC CA youll hate cones even more
PewDiePie you have to comeback because your subscribers growth is too slow you have to upload more  videos.
damn pewdiepie the best guy
So sad t series won
"These videos are so much more relaxing than what other people create now. Like him and Ken just talking and laughing at funny stuff. He is just chilling now not following the trends. It helps me feel more relaxed, like most people just keep up this crazy persona to get people to watch their videos. PewDiePie is just being himself now and it really makes me happy. I did not really watch PewDiePie to much before (sorry), but these videos are in a way easy to watch and helps me feel relaxed when I am stressing out and a lot more fun to watch aswell."
Japan shit
Look at his hairstyle!!!! He will have such handsome children. That swoop. Those piercing blue irises.
pp simulator
I really would like to move to Japan but I wouldn't be legally married to my partner there and he is chronically ill. I worry about him not being able to be on my insurance. Not sure how it would work in japan.
Ozawa tea coming !!!
Can she give birth at home?
I never thought that pewdiepie kid would be japanese
"Hi, I wanted to ask you how should I do to learn English through movies, TV series and songs, what methods should I apply, how should I approach these tools and how can I put them into practice? Ditto for books/audiobooks/podcasts and videos on youtube, where should I start if I'm at zero? Nb: I'm a 20-year-old boy and I haven't decided which path to take yet but at the moment I'm more oriented towards languages and I would also like to go and live in England____"
Can you speak Swedish?
finally bought merch for the first time since i was 15! my bro fist hoodie is officially done for. the logo is gone and it has holes...
The BARRELS have taken new apperance *spits* they have turned into cones
I'm just baffled by the fact that when you have a swede man who loves an Italian girl you get a Japanese kid.
test

I smiled back
nigga
Give me  the old pewdiepie

Hey Pewdiepie
6:06 I've never been threatened to this degree in my life.
"You can't be retired if you don't play the new amnesia game called amnesia bunker, everybody wants you to play even my brother that's the reason why your channel grow because of amnesia well, not really, but it will be fun though, memories markiplier is playing it"
day 1 of commenting  till if i  hit 1000 subscribers i will start giving shoutouts
Felix mr beast has passed cocomelon
"Walking with you to a location to make sure you got it right is ADORABLE. Like they want to know with their own eyes that you are aafen you got to your destinations  and are pround to take a foreigner  to the right direction. lmao they prob talk about it among their friend 

""a foreigner got lost and i TOOK HIM TO THE DESTINATIONS ! HE LOOKED LOST AND HE GOT THERE SAFE BECAUSE OF MEEEE!!"" or theyll say it more humbled lol"
so happy seeing pewds contented.
"6:07 - the point where everyone went to the comments to see, if anyone else smiled back, just to find out, that the top comment is exactly about everyone smiling back at Pewds."
6:07 Everybody smiled
Tranquility.
Recently on twt i saw so many negative things being said to pewdiepie about living to japan i was so furious hope they see this
Japan is the GOAT winter vibe. Nothing beats sitting in a Japanese coffee shop at night time watching everyone go past. All the city lights etc. It's surreal
"I'm so dreading going to have a conversation with someone xD It'll start with me proudly saying what I wanna buy, followed up by store personnel saying something back I don't understand. Resulting in a big fat error in my head leaving me speechless (brain says ""noooh"") :D"
dont forget to mention no ghetto ass ignorant hip hoppers.
"its cause your momma taught you english, how ever she managed it.
and google had a car that you understood how to drive.
and japan is cool. 
life is cool."
"the english language barrier is what keeps him in the shadows.
its like batman. but without rich people and technology."
"Felix i like you very much. 
I think we would get along so good. I wish your family all the best mate."
"As a Japan person, I can say that unless you're a crap guy like Johnny somali Japan people are nice to everyone. 
In other words, even if your Japanese doesn't speak well, you won't have any problems if you behave politely."
6:04 did you smiled back too? cause i am!
Wow I feel like I want to visit Japan!
Stereotypes exposed to reality!! Loving you content
WHEN YOU RELEASING THE TAPE??? WHEN??
"You can see in his face how peacefull he feels now. I'm so happy for him, hopefully one day I can achieve the same feeling"
"Guys who remembers ""Hej Hej Monika"" ?"
Eid Mubarak to everyone
"With videos like this some of my hope for humanity is regenerated. Because knowing how stupid Felix was ~6 years ago, it is calming to know that he could get this wise and smart."
"So trash cans, cones and rules? Really??"
Anyone know how to get the hero tee in black? As shown at 4:10?
Now u eating some bit#@ lasagna
Bro fell off with his subs
Visiting Japan in one month and this review really helped me
