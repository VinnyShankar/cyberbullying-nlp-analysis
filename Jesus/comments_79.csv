You can tell AR a hooper
Paolo had the best response by far.
Are they going to the Philippines??
Walker Kessler and Brandon Ingram have extremely long arms bro wtf
Austin Reaves and Brandon Ingram best players on the team
What a shame... it's almost like if you ask a soccer player if he can keep the ball in the air
Only ones that can spin it are the ones that don't want to put the work in on there feet instead they always holding a ball making it look like they hoopin
I feel better about my ball skills now. Thank you! lol
Austin reaves can do anything..
Okay this has got to be a joke. No way these guys can't spin a ball. That's something you start doing as a little kid
Who even are these dudes???
I knew Reaves would be to. Fundamentally sound lol
Notice everyone who can were drafted by the Lakers.
How come everyone except me is able to spin it outward? I can only spin it inward
Am I the only one who read BMNT as black mutant ninja turtles?
I knew reaves was gonna be good at it lol
What can't Austin do???
Reaves can do it all!
Real hoopers know
Paolo playing all out against his kids for spinning the ball
just Austin Rizz things
NO!!
"I thought this was basketball 101
Guess not!"
Paulo was havin none of that
"As a kid I thought it was so impressive but as an adult, it just seems pointless. That ability never helped when actually hooping."
Austin Reaves  is different
Who do you think will take the torch to the level Dr.J/Magic/Bird/Jordan/Kobe and LeBron once he retires?
"spinning a ball it's not part of the game, it isn't a skill to score a point in a game"
Ball look twice as big as bridges
Usa team is out in first round with these line up..
Ima say 7/10 of any player from the 90s too mid 2ks would know this off top
Of course austin reaves can do that
Nba peter parker silly as f
I can do it in the center of my hand
Cooper flagg better then everyone on team USA
Team USA IS F*****
what can't austin reeves do???
Kessler looks like Maxisnice the guy who impressionates nba players
"If they win the championship, they'll be the real Dream Team"
Skill positions
Im really good at that but i suck at basketball
Man these young guys not real hoopers fr
This disgusting how u in the nba and can't do this
Look ar reaves man so i spirational
Damn bronze medal here we come
Kessler so funny bro
Well AR15 is obviously the hooper.
This is sad.
The laker players did
I saw all them in Vegas USA vs Puerto Rico
Austin the OG old head in team USA
Has me annoyed how offended some of them got because they couldn't do something.  It's just a fun question
I hate interviewers who can't come up with good questions. Don't nobody over the age 10 gives a fck about a player spinning a ball on their finger.
"A reporter asked the NBA players about basketball stuff? 

Like asking Einstein, ""Can you solve physics problems?"""
Ofcourse AustHIM Reeves can spin the ball on his finger. LAKESHOW!!!
Of course Austin reaves is the expert. Real student of the game man
You can tell the ones who always had the back in their hands dribbling
Austin just can do everything in the world
wow i thought professionals basketball players can do it all smdh
I knew Reeves could for some reason
AR is a masterclass hooper. Bro really got a good bag
"I am 11 and can do it better than number 1,2 and prolly some of the others"
Solid ng line up ng USA puro young star wla lng c Zion Williamson
This USA team is not even going to win bronze
It would be Austin reeves
Roster looking sub par
AR15 COLD FOR THAT!
LAKERS IN 6!!!
If you cannot spin a ball you will not start
I always though every single nba player could do that
We bout to lose..
Now i can do something with a basketball ball that an NBA player can't
I only know 2 of these players.  How sad because I used to know who all the players were.  NBA sucks now
No
"The way people hating on this team is wild, how can u hate these dudes"
I can spin the ball on every finger that's how I use to take people money in school.. They use to bet me I can't easy lunch money
Austin Reaves looked so smooth with it.
glad its not just me
Once again. Austin Reeves being the GOAT.
Poalo spoke fax
"Oh good to know, nba players couldnt do this"
"Yes, I can!"
2 years unc players and 2 Duke players
these countries boutta see austin n walker n think the mormon church is coming for them
Paolo comment is hilarious!
"Walker Kessler didn't even let her finish the question before emphatically saying ""no"""
Utah loves you Walker!!! GO JAZZ!!
these can't be Team USA lmao
"NO
i can't"
All day!
Seeing this make me feel really talented spinning the ball for more than 4 second
It's not even important to the game it does nothing
New Era of basketball right here
AR MVP
Austin Reeves the coolest man alive
Reeves hart ingram
BI cold
Paolo should of came to Italy you traitor
"I learned how to spin a ball on my finger after watching that Pistol Pete movie where in it he spins the ball on his finger for an hour and then headbutts the ball into the basket. Now I can just throw the ball up 3 feet in the air and catch it on my finger

*sometimes*"
the funny part is when they try to explain why they cant
Walker Kessler seems like that one dude that is just randomly there for comedic relief and it's great
"Yea you can spin it but can you guard me- Paolo

~2012"
bro AR15 has the power
They really wanted these goofies over Trae Young smh
Fiba World Cup bout to be interesting as a Philippine fan
Why tf have I never heard walker Kessler speak until just now
AR-15! Go lakers!!!!
w austin
Worst USA team ever
Reeves is skinny but my man playing like dirk
"How is Austin Reeves so good?! Honestly no muscle definition, looks like a hs senior in the face and is a straight up baller! I love it."
If you a pro and can't that means you just in the NBA because you are tall
"Who else picked Austin, before they saw the video.. Austin is one of those guys from the neighborhood that beat you at Pool, Golf, wrestling, boxing, popping wheelies etc."
AND WE PAID YOU ALL THAT MONEY
i could just never respin it.. too strong probably
I'm actually surprised
Ar15 the man
"If you can't spin a ball on your finger, you never loved the game."
Paolo took that personally.
I thought Paola play for Italy instead
The most disrespectful f u
"Finally, something I have over done nba players lol."
Ingram high as shit boy
J Hart spinning the ball on the finger and giving the finger at the same time.
Jimmy the only dude i see recently do it in game
Amazing that some players dont know how. Times have changed.
Paolo
Brandon be looking like 58 years old
"Just sharing you this, as Romans 6:23 says, ""For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."" When you die in sin, you will end up in hell. But God loves you so much that he sent his son Jesus Christ to die on the cross to pay all the sins of the world for us. Believe in Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior to be saved from sin and have eternal life (John 3:16). As you're saved from sin, repent your sins. Turn away from sin and do righteous things."
What a disgrace.  These kids don't love the game like players used too.
Bro I swear Walker Kessler is the nicest alien of all time
Reaves like a BOSS !!!
"This is awesome, i'm officially better than half the US team in 1 specific part of basketball. That's an absolute win!"
Kessler replied so quick
Can any of them spin it without using the other hand to start it??
I'm not surprised that Paulo and Kessler couldn't do it. But I'm really surprised that Brunson and Haliburton couldn't.
I knew this freak who could spin a ball for weeks at a time on his pinky toe
I'm not alone in this world
Kessler is a great pick up for the team USA even tho he's a rookie he and lauri carry the jazz in the second half of the season
Swear . 1v1
this team gonna have issues
Lol none of these dudes got street ball handles
Yeah It bothers me that I'm not good at that.
Easy just twist the ball and spin at your fingers and slap it
The most trash team USA ever.
Austin reaves the real hoop head lol
that boy from Arkansas can thoooooo
Why the walls look like minecraft tho
this is the scariest national bench players of all time
I learned how to do this at 12
who he play for?
It's actually very easy.The trick is to pre- spin it before putting your finger as balanced (no wobble) as you can
Pete Maravich has entered the chat.
Curry can't even do it and he's probably the most technically skilled basketball player that's ever lived. Tells you all you need to know about how useful of a skill it is.
Reeves ball spinning smooth
I'm convinced reeves a black man stuck in that white goofy body!!!!
I'm not an NBA or a pro player but bro I can spin the ball in my finger for like 1 minute or more hehe.
"I can do that, can't play basketball though"
My guys Mikal and Cam
Looks weird as shit when the lefties do it
norman powell
155
I feel that Paolo
Bruh Ingram always looks geeked out of his mind
Team Canada+400 just on it now. Lol
Half of the players are from Nyc
These guys are stupidly tall.
"Paolo,Bridges,Jaren Jackson And Reeves Please Help USA"
Austin Reaves and J Hart ftw
Yu would of thought nba players can spin the ball on they finger
Team looking flame
USA jerseys trash
I can spin a ball on my finger shit is easy af
Reeves got the glow coming off big contract
Don't need to spin it when you can dunk shoot or dribble it
Who are these guys?
"I've always been kinda bummed that I can't keep the ball spinning after the initial spin since I thought any ""baller"" could do it without effort.  I realize watching this vid, who cares?"
paolo saying ok but play me 1v1 lmaooo
why did Walker Kessler say it so meanly
"Im not a basketball player and can donit and change fingers while spinn8ng. No idea how i know how, just alwYs have been"
Can someone tell me why they don't have kd  on usa
New quote of the year.. alright play one on one
Lets go walker kessler
My boy AR15 too good
The entire Villanova championship team is there
Paolo smile my bro ffs
Paulo about to show out for the world
AR stl so skinny tho..thot he gonna jacked like CaruShow dis summer??
"Thats why austin reaves da goat, most improved player next year, im calling it"
Reeves is the best man
I might need to teach these guys a lesson
I finally found a basketball skill that I have better than an NBA player
"Love that Paulo is playing for the USA team, and my jazzman Kessler!"
This team so ass
Ingram looks like Jason Mamoa in a younger darker version
AR is my guy.. so excited to see his time as a laker unfold.
Bro reaves is not him breh idk how he gets so much credit fucking ass
This makes me feel better about me.
The most unless skill in basketball. Nobody practicing Harlem Globetrotter moves.
Dang I can spin a ball on my finger better than people in the NBA I guess I am a goat
"lol, Kessler really said _""it's an important part of the game""_

Well, if you could euro-step then spin-the-ball-in-your-finger while in the air then lay it up, i'll be damned"
Wtf they just like me then lmao
Mikal the best one here
Look at Reeves man so inspirational
