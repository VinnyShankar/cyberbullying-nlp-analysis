I miss this Thor
https://youtube.com/@timelessfilmvault
How much ya think hulk weighs?
Nothing can top Avengers 1 .. it was ahead of its time.
2y8eu
I'm thinking Thor could just simply drop his hammer on his enemies and their unworthiness would kill them
"Do you see how you don't understand my situation, it's because you're not me...hulk"
PABLO ESCOBAR
The agility of Black Widow is always so impressive on screen!
I used to love watching hulk and his movies as a kid but Damm before professor hulk came this one scene of mark ruffalo gave me chills.
"Just realized Thor's horrible realization of all that is Hulk..his face goes from ""Holy hell!"" to ""Holy hell, what have gotten myself into?"" as he gets his real first look at Hulk. Great acting by Hemsworth."
What if the Hulk was worthy
"This version of hulk is nothing compared to incredible hulk (Edward Norton) for he who never hurt the girl he loves and is always there to protect her, still have some kindness for the one he love, unlike this one who flings everyone in his path"
The Incredible Gamma Monster vs The Mighty God of Thunder.
Hulk used to be so badass. He stopped a giant flying worm just with one fist. I doubt that Thanos would be able to.resist that blast
I miss this MCU Hulk
"Too dim, can't see clearly"
"I really want to know, what material is Hulk's pants made of, why do the pants only half rot every time he transforms?"
Black Widow got no boobs
Hulk is really strong. Wow.
woow
Savage Hulk is the best
"2:24
Thought of it as a Katana. Just realized the Head would get Slice off with One Strike."
"Army personnel,look at the size of this creature who really exists. Can i actually get paid for having this as a personality?"
"2:43 
Reference to Hulk vs. Thor"
"I feel like Hulk has a feud between Thor, Wolverine, Juggernaut and Abomination in media. 

_Looks like this scene proves our point._"
Same hulk crying over Natasha's death news.
I still think this was the best fight with these two. Hulk was just a raging beast. When thor hit hulk with the hammer the theater ERUPTED.
Views!!!!
"Probably the best Hulk scene in film imo. The terror of being trapped in a closed space with a best who cannot be killed and runs through walls, then the actual god of thunder holding back just enough that their fight doesnt destroy everything"
Target Angry!!! Target Angry!!!
Back when the Hulk was truly the incredible Hulk and not a cheap f**** knockoff.
"I was 7 when I saw this, so this was my first real time seeing the Hulk, it absolutely felt intimidating and terrifying. And nowadays I see him as Shrek."
Nice
The guy being caught by the hulk and thrown is probably a goner from the force of all that.
D
"My favorite hero hands down...I miss the rage moments, now it seems they keep failing to do him justice"
A channel is born
Man it's perfect
Wow ive never saw this part before
Love loki smile
The CGI here is pretty solid
0:17
"Thor seeing Hulk: ""Verily, earth indeed has its own trolls""."
Awesome fight between two titans
"They really knew how to make movies then Natasha being terrified, Thor surprised then exited about how strong hulk really is, great action but more importantly great storytelling"
objetivo enojado! objetivo enojado!! xD
I prefer the Hulks that dont know how to speak and they just roar and fight those were the like the prime eras of Hulk i feel that once he started to develop a personality and started to talk more often is when he started to lose the way that he is meant to be and that is scary
Imagine trying to inject out of a jet just to be caught mid injection by the Hulk
What a cool way that Thor calls his hammer
Never knew Thor Is stronger than hulk
2.51 hulk carga el miolmir con todo y thor....:P
If hulk took Mjolnir to the chin and got up how did Thanos best him so easily
The first 10 sec felt like Bruce transforming in the middle of snu snu with natasha even their expression felt natural for that.
2:02-2:03
"I miss the REAL Hulk, not in the Avengers: Endgame."
Samson the Hebrew warrior could snap thors hammer

The Hulk stole the show in this film. Just wish that he's character arc was taken more seriously throughout the next phases like this.

2008 and this hulk are the only ones that exist. Maybe 03 also. Everything after was pure character assassination. Hulk getting beat by iron man and thanos so easily was a joke.
That was terrible
1:34 you can see Hulk's expression change from anger to realizing what he was doing moments before he was intercepted by Thor. He was just about to stop himself from hitting her.
THIS is the HULK that should've been in Infinity War & Endgame.

i wonder how many times bruce bought new jeans for himself
black widow is spider ? true or not
I wish this version of hulk fought thanos. Less considerate and humane.
"Love the scene when Thor, oops up and he is like 'ok this fight might actually be decent'"
"To think, Thor doesn't even need his Hammer to put the Hulk's s#%*t out in the street."
Hss tkk undergraduate mr headhunter steenbergen wna qureshi
i could only imagine how terrifying it would be to run from LITERALLY the hulk while he tears apart everything that gets in his way as if it's all made of paper lol
Hulk saw the woman.Hulk want woman
"its sad in the end hulk was reduced to nothing, all these movies making him look insanely strong only for thanos to beat his arse in a min.  And made him so scared he wouldn't come out again."
"2:25 I still don't understand, how this blow did not knock out his teeth and HulkBuster only with a punch knocked out a tooth"
Hulk was so fucking awesome in this movie ..

Hulk was beating the shit outta Thor in this fight
"This scene perfectly shows why The
Hulk and Thor are the heavy hitters of
the Avengers."
2:24. That's one of or rather the cleanest hit in the entire MCU
@cristian@gonzale@4be4eu6K
"This is how you do Hulk vs Thor.

Fuck that arena bullshit!

Hulk gets hit as many times as he hits Thor. 

No stupid ass electroshock (which in itself is retarded since he's the God of Thunder and Lightning) that knocks him out when he's winning.

Even the comedic moment (Hulk punches Thor off screen after working together taking down the Chitari tank) between them is done right.

Marvel did them both dirty by Ragnarok."
.
I can't believe the most replayed scene of this scene is that one second of widows ass
I love movies:they'd shoot an omnipotent or maybe an impenetratable body and not care about it.
"Something i like about hulk is when ever he comes out he rages immediately at whats in front of him, not because of his desire to hurt but because he knows whenever he is around its because Bruce is in danger and he's simply defending himself"
Poor HULK nobody loves him
Is that not enough proof
Dont vatch the hammer
"I miss this bad ass and serious thor, its a disgrace what they have done to him, theyve turned him into a little bitch hung up on broads"
1:07 Hulk Jumpscare
This hulk has more running speed than the original Bruce banner did in the very first hulk movie in 2003
0:37 omg when Bruce started chasing her in this movie I was like HS and now I'm trying to figure out why is he trying to hurt her for if she knows he is Bruce can anyone help me understand please

"""Target angry, target angry!"" I do love it when even the minor characters in a movie are able to get a laugh out of me..."
TARGET ANGRY TARGET ANGRY!!! is such a funny line :D
"1:30 Damn, the Hulk was about to put the pimp-hand on her!"
"I love how well black widow is rendered in this scene. While literally the beginning of the movie showed her being badass, in this scene, she showed her intelligence, combat strategy, agility and also her humanity. I also love how strong she is. Literally after getting slapped from the hulk,She kicked the mind-controlled Hawkeye's ass."
What is the name of film
bhai koun sa app ka use krte ho

Damn look at the views
"lol target angry, target angry"
This is Thor's first encounter with Hulk in the mcu. Imagine being him in this scene. He's probably fought hundreds of monsters at this point with a lot of them being many times his size. And yet one of the strongest opponents he's ever met was this big green angry guy who moments before was a mere human and yet is currently tossing him around like nothing. I know in this scene he isn't necessarily trying to fight him just keep him busy while everyone else either gets to safety or repairs the ship. But it's still gotta be crazy to him.
Why do the pants get bigger but not the shirt?

Too bad they eliminated the angry Hulk. Anger is just 90% of the Hulk character.
"I never understood Hulk's anger toward Black Widow in this scene.  She was no threat to him, but he literally would have killed her if not for Thor's intervention. Was it just because she was there and he was just lashing out at whoever was unlucky enough to be in there with him?  Hulk never struck me as an indiscriminant killer."
Why is Thor dodging the fire from the Jet?

"Idc what anyone says but Avengers is in the top 5 best MCU movies of all time. Joss Whedon and Co. Made a movie that was just like the comics. As im looking back to the early years of the mcu as the current state of the MCU isnt in a good spot yes GOTG 3 has just came out and hopefully its a certified Banger, but this movie right here got mostly everything right the comic accurate portrayal of all the Avengers especially Hulk and Thor as the 2 of them got treated badly by the MCU more so hulk than thor as thor actually got a trilogy of movies but love and thunder is shit. Like hulk/Bruce Banner is very good in this movie he isnt the most prominent character in the movie especially Banner but when they get the spotlight they steal the show."

"Man, look how good it was lighten. Marvel today is just dark, grey and bland. In the Avengers we can see everything what is needed to be seen."
"So if the ship can hold the hammer up, is IT worthy?"

As an adolescent i just thought how cool Hulk is. Now I think that this version is so freaking terrifying. Just imagining myself as Natasha looking at this mad-ridden face in 0:32 makes me shiver in fear.

That knee to Hulk's face sounded weak AF!!!! It had no oomph to it.
wow i must admit i've never seen this hulk before. i thought he's weak but watching this....i think over time the writers made him weak
"I love how much is exposition is accomplished in this scene without having to sink into unnecessary off-screen narrative or derivative dialogue: Black Widow's combat intelligence but also her humanity are shown in her abject fear of the Hulk, Hulk's power (which is further demonstrating by pitting him against Thor, the character who had been the strongest Avenger until that moment) and the degree of rage that is pent up in him, Thor's heroism, the power of Thor's hammer, Thor's viking-like thirst for battle...  Avengers was never a ground-breaking film, but it's an absolute master class in how film story-telling can be done right."
https://youtube.com/shorts/5rSGmP8bli8?feature=share
"On paper Hulks only pluses and not minuses over Thor are strength, healing factor, and sonically boomer sounds while Thor bests The Hulk with combat experience, stealth, speed, reflexes, agility, acrobatics, stamina, endurance, durability, balance, as well as thunder, lightning, storms, weather powers, as well as the Hammer yeah."

Thor was weakened by dark magic when he fought hulk. That is the reason why he had trouble stopping hulk's slam

2:50 I love how they embodied the combo of a Silverback and just a PISSED off man with these roars but still... 2008 hulk would've killed everyone no doubt

What I loved about the old Marvel films is the balance use of practical effects and CGI. Now we rarely see practical effects in use. Even the costumes are CGI.

The Hulk video game was kinda cool. I think it was built on the same engine as some of the Spider-Man game. He could jump REALLY HIGH
"Who miss hulk girlfriend NATASHA aka Black widow.
A only girl who got attraction and  loves on Hulk ."
This is the closest thing to the horror HULK actually is. johansson did a flawless job at selling the fear in this movie.

"This hulk is close to what the real hulk is supposed to be. this one is still an idiot with no smarts, the ed norton hulk, now that thing was scary, the one before that was awesome as well, just imagine the size of the Eric bana hulk and the CGI of Bruce Banner hulk. good god in heaven that really would have been something."
Ok
"I don't know why they say that Norton's Hulk was the most aggressive in the movies, for me this Hulk is crazy to the point of attacking Black Widow who hadn't done him any harm, Norton's Hulk was aggressive but with whom they attacked him, but sometimes he contained himself when Betty Ross was present, this Hulk even when controlled by Banner destroyed and crushed chitauris left and right, stopped a chitauri whale with one fist, fought hand to hand with the god of thunder and shook Loki like a rag doll, Norton's Hulk, Ross's army almost captured him and he barely managed the abomination, I don't know but this 2012 Hulk is perfect, and then the nerf in the later movies That's another story, but I prefer the Hulk directed by Joss Whedon, even the cgi is infinitely superior, the 2008 cgi was horrible, even in the night scenes it seemed like something out of a video game, I repeat Norton's Hulk was very good but I don't see it so special"

"They really worked hard on this. There are small little details that the animators put in that really add to the immersion. Like the strap on Mjolnir, sparks bouncing off of stuff, Hulk's dirty hand leaving a smudge on the glass of the cockpit, and tons of other examples in this film. That's love of a product.

Black Widow wasn't what triggered his anger, and Hulk normally only attacks things that actively provoke him.
He just goes after her because... she's there? Which doesn't seem very Hulk-like."

"Ryan coogler really said namor could take on these two, this fight says otherwise, especially thor who's been known to casually deadlift the nine relms."
"When Marvel makes movies like these again, most fans will return. Gone are the days of such good movies that just told interesting stories, and didn't push convoluted politics."
Hello
Thor here was great. Cocky and powerful. Hate the comedy version.

Op
I don't like Thor in any of these movies. Just doesn't feel right. Neither does wimpy Captain America. And Thors hair changes right in the middle of the scene. So blatantly obvious.

I like the idea of them giving hulk control of his anger but they should've made him keep his power and loose control

Had to agree with everything he said."
I always wonder why does his clothes torn except his panths
"The best part of this scene is everybody on the ship feels Hulks presence. Loki half way across the ship hears him roar. Natasha is scared shitless, and thor is ready for a fight. One of the best scenes for hulk in any marvel movie."

"399 Million!! The Quality,The Classic Result Of The Old MCU..."
This was the first marvel scene I ever watched
#idontrememberthisscene
Does this look anywhere close to the muscular toddler they show as hulk in the subsequent movies? Marvel is the example of a franchise which instead of growing with its fans decided to shift it's target to younger and younger audience with each movie.

Thor Saving Black Widow from Hulk Back handing her back in time to the Russian Revolution, 
the very next shot I was like ""wooooow...""
I did NOT expect to see Hulk vs Thor this early in what was clearly going to be the first of many Avengers films, it was a fantastic surprise!
ALSO,
I was thinking the Shield Helicarrier was the absolute worst place they could fight the Hulk (This was great on the part of the filmmakers!), so there was that sense of tension the first time watching which you didn't have a lot of  with previous solo hulk adventures, you just wanted to see him Hulk out and mess stuff up, here it was like OHHH NO, NOT HERE! The Collateral Damage and lives lost if Hulk was unleashed would be too disastrous to contemplate. So that was a First for Hulk live action appearances! O.O"
This part was like a horror movie with the Hulk!
2008 Hulk would've made quick work of Thor. MCU Hulk sucks bruh
Whats the Girls name sorry I only watch Hulk.

"I'm so much disappointed that the so called modern MCU movies look ridiculous and obvious forexample thor love and thunder ....you can't even feel the weight of the hammer like in such a movie.
It's so easy to hate thor love and thunder and love avengers 1. Because of the complexity and how they made scenes so realistic than these so called modern current movies.
MCU is losing track."
why ?  america does not send hulk or iron man so it will end putin president russia if it is true
this is the hulk that shoulda fought Thanos
oh yeah torh is powerful avenger
This looks like it was made for a high budget television show

We went from this to twerking She-hulk...
"Funny how people still try to stop beings like the hulk with normal ass military tech and think it's a good idea.
Oh yeah the thunder god is not handling the fight? Lets try to shoot him with a tank or a jet, that always works."

pilot when he ejects
Hulk was about to bitch slap his future girlfriend. That's was pretty weird since hulk's never slapped anyone before
This shit probably really happened
The would make this scene today joke after joke

How did we get from this THOR character to the one we saw in Love and Thunder?
Man, how time flies.
How the mighty have fallen!!!"

"While I like Norton's Hulk more, Ruffalo's Hulk was still intimidating in this movie and even in the second Avengers movie (even if I hated him being beaten by Hulkbuster)... But now he's just a joke, just like Thor"

"Just think another 5 years and all marvel will be woke....Hulk will now get happy talk with a lisp.  No longer turn green but a beautiful color rainbow.  The mighty Thor will weld a unique bouquet of flowers.  Captain America will no longer called Captain America you'll use the pronouns THEM/THEY..... And this is the start all because you pansy arse people sit at the computer all day don't get out and work, vote or do anything creative but b*tch about how bad your life is in your mom and dads house at 25.  With no real ambitions you created your own me too movement and how your life is so hard.  Do us all a favor clean up your corner full of c*m stained stocks and that 2 year old pizza boxes off the floor and make something of your lives."
And now we have Feminist Hulk lol

"Next year it's very possible universal rights on the hulk ends, and marvel will have 100% of the rights, that means we will get hulk solo movies, and seeing what happened in she hulk, it's probably we get a planet hulk or world war hulk movie, in any case, we will get a 2nd hulk solo movie"

2:11 ok enough of this shit
i really like this movie
"And i love how they thought sending a fighter jet against him was gonna do anything. Nope, the hulk is still pretty invulnerable. Thats another jet down the tubes. And the pilot was surprised that it didnt work considering the history of literally everything thrown at him. Nobody seems to learn in these films."
LOL the hulk would literally liquify her with that punch if he moved through metal like its paper.
"some cool melding of practical and computer generated effects in this scene. I love the set destruction, really grounds the whole fight."
What happened to the mcu ..
Superman could've taken him down in seconds.  Thor is weak.
Come in chanell pls
why only his pants are magic and grow with him?

"1:05 this part really shows the most terrifying aspect of the hulk, he can be quiet and stealthy when he wants to be"
"From a purely visual standpoint, this has to be the best version of the hulk ever to be put to the screen."
"I love the part when black widow says, so that's your plan right?! You're trying to release the hulk, and he still ended up releasing the hulk even by being locked in a cage. True story plot,"

E muito bom
She should have died when hulk hit her
Sad this is the last time we actually saw Hulk then it turned GOOFY. All of Marvel became Goofy and the obvious agenda filled

"This movie is bad. so bad in fact that i can prove it with basic math. just by looking at your video alone, no less.
right now as i am typing this, the likes are at about 2,000,000 and the views are at 393,262,065.
now if we subtract 2,000,000 from 393,262,065, we get  391,262,065, and that shows that the 2 million likes are not even a fraction of the amount of views, and I'm not done yet. 
on average, only *2/3* the amount of people watching the video will react with a like or dislike, and we already have the like number. so that means if we multiply 391,262,065 by 2/3, we should get approximately 260,841,376 dislikes.
so you have      2,000,000   likes, to
approximately  260,841,376   dislikes.
so if someone can prove that this movie is terrible, with *BASIC* math, then these producers have a problem, and they need to get it together."
