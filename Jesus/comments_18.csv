Of friggin course Johnny Knoxville's the one to test nature like that lol.
Sex?
"Kimmel no Carson or Leno;
Salmoni's remarkable...!!!"
The only reason I would watch his show is if he announced that he will be setting himself on fire
Jimmy is acting afraid of everything.That's annoying.
I'm glad the toucan met his long lost brother
Jimmy is so annoying
I would petted the caracal if I knew it probably wouldn't hurt me.
BIG FLOPPA
feeling Kind of bad for the animals
Now everyone has seen the floppa
"""When he sees something he wants to eat-"" 

*stares at the camera"
That cat wants to eat the camera man
you all know what animal we're really here for
Floppaaa
The moment the caracal arrived I literally lost it. XD
Omg its a floppa
Was anyone else getting pissed off at the idiot with the glasses or is it just me?
floppa.
"I love at 5:29 how it says ""Best predator in the wild when he sees what he wants to eat"" then cuts to a shot of it looking directly into the camera"
ahi estoy
FLOPPA FANS like
Bruh thats the most chill Caracal ever
"4:37 ""i love when you call me big floppa"""
the big floppa at 4:38
The true star of the show 4:40
"Dear gods, but Kimmel's afraid of everything. This is awful."
and Kat shows up....
jews be like ... umm datz our cat...
"""His head seems too small for the rest of his body"".... had me dying"
I think a crocodile just died there
5:32 You are next!
Floppy is doing the company of advice
Hecker Hecked in a Jimmy Kimmel show
"I cant believe Jimmy got Big Floppa to be a guest on his show
truly incredible"
Johnny is trying his best to get bitten.
Omg Hecker is famous!
"One should not fear the flopper in the home. But when the flopper is in the wild, fear him."
"I hate it when they do this. Cheap entertainment for chewp laughs, while these animals are Terrified by all the lights and noises etc."
"johny messes with bulls, he can survive a bird :D"
Nice
"I admit, I only clicked this video just to see the mighty floppa."
I'd love to watch a whole series of these 3 going on animal adventures!
I want a Caracal!
love your video
That 'NO' and look at the camere in 5:50 was like a mom getting annoyed by man toiching her babies. And yeah i'm getting annoyed as well
floppa
Floppa is being such a little floppa
OMG FLOPPA REAL
MY MAN FLOPPA
Jimmy before a beard
They are perfect pets.Unperfect pets doesn't exist.We must take care of them and love them.
FLOPPAAAA
froot loops
"""This guy is one of the best predators in the wild, when he actually sees something he wants to eat very few things can get away from that""
Caracal: sees the camera*"
The caracal is better than the disgusting poor bullshit called Peso Pluma.
The playing scared routine is so overdone.   Hearing the expert talk is far more enjoyable and interesting then Kimmel any day of the week.
I want a Floppa
"the toucan's mouth looks a little stretched,i wonder if the mouth is plastic and there not a real toucan"
Johnny looking at the that croc like omg i remember the tightrope
"This humongous cat "" Floppa"" is caracal"
Flooopa
FLOPPA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"a bobcat living with royalty.....
moco isnt afraid"
"Why is everyone in the comments section approving Johnny Knoxville behavior ? The guy is not respecting any of the warning coming from Dave and he acts so freaking stupidly ... Fine it's ""all fun and jokes"" but if anything had happened, Dave and Jimmy would be in big trouble for it .... He's just stupid"
we hate @Jimmy Kimmel Live mean to floppa :(
Lol Johnnys laugh 7 seconds in the clip
Lmfao dude was so annoyed with Knoxville
FLOPPA
That toucan was gorgeous!
Caracal?MORE LIKe FLOPPA
"I've watched countless videos of domesticated caracals and they do make great pets from what I've seen. Only if you have the means to care for them and can give them the right kind of home, because their upkeep is very expensive. I see nothing wrong with having one as a pet at all. I would have one if I could. Caracals have a great history with humans and there's no record of a caracal killing a human. Not a single case! Yet, Pit Bulls are harming and killing people all the damn time, and people still want to own them with how dangerous they are. I think you'd be  much safer having a  Caracal as a pet than a Pit Bull! Just saying."
floppa?
"5:31 
Guy : whenever it sees something it wants to eat to
The cat : *looking at cameraman*"
"""Froot Loops Bird"""
thats a floppa
Jimmy is a oedophile
He has my Floppa brother
f l o p p a f l o p p a f l o p p a f l o p p a f l o p p a f l o p p a f l o p p a f l o p p a f l o p p a f l o p p a f l o p p a f l o p p a f l o p p a f l o p p a f l o p p a f l o p p a f l o p p a f l o p p a f l o p p a f l o p p a f l o p p a f l o p p a
I love that the caracal stares at the camera when he said they stare at what they wanna eat
Floppa Its On The Show Yay!
Kimmel is the may he
5:30 the camraman was shaking
idiot
I never knew floppa was on there
"I have never heard of a caracal before, very cool animal."
Floppa
Since when does Tim Tebow work with animals
johnny was rude in this segment to dave not listening to things he was saying
"The cat looks grossly overfed.
Probably to keep it sedated along with all the drugs they fed it before it came on stage."
Its not a caracal.  Its a floppa
Back when talk shows were great and not political
"The wild cat be like: f*ck you all, i was fighting with my ex."
Floppa is so cute
Wish the cat would tear out jimmys vocal chords he sounds like a bi -ch
Shawn Mendes on Jimmy Kimmel
"Dnt know how ppl can put up with jimmy , he so boring n searches for anyone or thing or animal to come on his show so he can add silly sly sarcasm n obnoxious humour in it"
THERE AREN'T COUGARS IN REAL LIFE
Just for a show u r troubling that little life... He is scared in that light n camera... Hv some compassion
Should call it guinness
Beautiful animals :)
5:32the way he looks at the camera
Wkwkwk biturong
"Floppa: 0000000000000000000000,001%"
5:30
cant believe they got floppa on stage
The head and facial features of the caracal looks like a cat
Cutest animal ever!
"Jibby Kibble, I want my 9:05 back."
Try playing beer pong with the toucan
Dave was probably like never have me on with another guest again.
"Jimmy Kimmel is an embarrassment to the American male, thank GOD we still have a few Johnny Knoxville's left that liberalism hasn't castrated..."
"5:29 
""This is one of the best predators in the world, when he sees something he wants to eat-""

Floppa : *You.*"
R.I.P cameraman
"I don't get why people are afraid of cats no bigger than your average dog? Even if it attacks, you should be able to overpower it."
"This guy is one of the best predators in the wild... When he actually sees something he wants to eat.

Caracal stares at the camera man:"
Omg raise a floppa
"Floppa Famous Live, Has Subs"
Johnny Knoxville does not fear death. The reaper owes him 20 bucks.
Hecker got his own show?
It's weird that the Caracal didn't hiss here.. lol
5:41 he sees you
"when he sees something he wants to eat
""looks at camrea man"""
"Everything Scares Kimmel....his own Shadow scares him!!!. Damn, grow a Backbone!!!."
Wow masbro
"Johnny Kockville sees something that will hurt him and he gets excited about it. That's why he is famous for still somehow being alive. Almost doesn't seem like he knows how to be a talkshow person so when he sees a crocodile he think ""yay! something I can actually work with!"""
Its like a smaller puma with lynx ears
4:43
Johnny still got them ball of steels not like the moderator
Is it named Lyle. I must know
"Stupid people, stupid program."
"5:32
Dave: when he sees something he wants to eat..
Floppa: stares straight into the camera*"
Hey
"Caracals seems very agressive, because they hisses all the time,.but that's actually the way how they communicate"
5:30 So he went to eat the camera man
F L O P P A
Johnny has ballz of steel
Why you guys hating on kimmel
YouTube Eric Dubay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Please Jimmy bring the caracals back
bro that floppa wants you eat the camra or even the camra guy
Is Johnny Knoxville from Florida?
2:47 the toucan's reflex while sitting on jims arm to the arm that comes up to it is insanely quick. love viewing how animals of the wild are beyond entuned with the environment they're in.
Las primeras escenas de Floppa tv
"Salmoni: They not like domestic cats.
Caracal: Scoot over dad first Imma suggle wit ya and den I want to chill with you on the couch because you taught me that it's rude to sit on tables at home while we were snuggling together watching dat movie with dat yummy bowl kitty tin food you bought. I love ya hooman daddy."
Dave was trying to tame Johnny more than the animals
4:34 Oh Yeah
Bloppa
Fr
Why was I recommended a woke crap?
Dave was human taming more than animal taming with Johnny lmao
FLOPPPA
I'm surprised see that ol' Floppa didn't go all Holden lion on either Jimmy or Johnny. LOL
I think it would have just been hilarious of that caracal would have grabbed Jimmy by the throat with its canines.
ohohoho camera man YOU ARE DEAD
Who thought it would be a good idea to have the animal guy bring a croc and be on stage at the same time as Johnny Knoxville?
Big Floppa is the MVP
Johnny Obnoxiousville is living up to his namesake
The fruitloops bird
Johnny was annoying to watch in this
"Big floppa is so cute, i love him so much"
Hey floppa came to interview
Floppa.
Jimmy is a total wimp.
5:15 not a singe thought behind that cat's eyes
"""when it actually sees what he wants to eat not many things can get away from it""

Floopa: * Looks at me *"
"why is that these talk show hosts are so wimpy? Jimmy Kimmel, Jimmy Falon are both so wimpy"
Hecker looks cute
I own a floppa They're pretty nice in  Less You get too close and it will hiss at you
Floppa is very mad jimmy stole his show
If it sees something he wants to eat looks at the cameraman
The Toucan got me interested in adopting one.
Flop
"The anteaters is nice! It just needs something solid to grip, not soft skin"
"I gotta say. In terms of animal segments, Conan O'Brien leaves Jimmy Kimmel in the dirt."
ayo floppa on jimmy kimmel?
I hope.he.bites the.guy.with the glasses on
jimmy is such a pussy. worst host for animals. why even have them if you are scared to even pet them?
"Talm bout lil crevices and things, smh"
Floppa :D
big floppa
Me loove floopa
"Me at the start : does the guy on the left have deathwish or no sense of self sustain?
Me after reading comments it's Knoxville : Oh, that explains everything"
Best episode ever
The caracal looks like a floppa
Big FLOPPA HUGE FLOPPA
the camera man be shitting his pants
*F L O P P A*
"quite late, but start at 5:29 and end at 5:32"
Let Johnny be Johnny; he's survived much more than an animal bite; I don't think Dave knows this man's legendary status.
"Guys, yes you are right it is my son caracal in video"
"Director to the Caracal: you might wanna avoid the hissing thing, ppl will get scared
Him: you are safe but just this once"
it is a floppa
Please shut up Jimmy please for the love of God let him speak
5:32
Omg is floppa
2:44
Baby floppas are so cute I want a floppa for a pet they are soooo cute
4:36 floppa
How did that caracal not hiss even once in front of a room of a bunch of humans? I'd think it would be freaking out.
jimmy is such a delicate little   lady hes terrified of a cat  he is so scared
Bro I wanted to see a capybara
Big Floppa
It be nice if Jimmy would shut up for a bit and let Dave talk and educate us.
Big floppa
"That caracal seemed quite down to earth, compared to some of the ones shown on YouTube."
CARACAL
This is the episode that Jimmy shat himself lol
El patron x Johnny Knoxville 4:37
a wild floppa appeared
ITS A FLOPPA YES
I think this is the first time that Big Floppa gets his big role
That's smaller than big Floppa cat Gregory Gosha
5:30 mans got the munchies
Floppy overload
It could be really dangerous looking and when the women fetch them it seems like they become pets instantly
Floppa is stare you
"What an interesting face. And 9,000 ants in a day? How many ants are there?"
This blue shirt guy seems really stupid.
How is there Floppa in there?
Okay so rite now i hate you for that collar is a bad bad thing too.hatis just hatis
5:28
Jimmy is terrible with animals. Noisy and frightened.
The day hecker showed up with Jimmy.
8 years later and I'm still curious about how they got that crocodile out of there.
Johnny is a stupid
Hi I'm johnny Knoxville and welcome to jackass
Omg Floppa
Ja volim floppa
"I'm kind of curious do cats like Caracals have domestic genes in them? Because I know that many wild dog species have have domestic dog genes that spread back in to the wild. Or rather is that where the domestic cat was bred from?

The look on their face seems very similar to a domestic cat."
Floppas or caracals which are called floppas are able to be made as a pet
The bird is like a perfect digital creation!!!
F. Flopa
"I would love to see these animals up close like that, I wanna be able to hold a gorgeous Tucan"
BIG FLOPPA IS GO JIMMYS SHOW
FLOPPA IS FAMOUS :0
Floppa. King of the flop
"Some say the crocodile is still there 
*waiting*"
I think we all clicked because of floppa
FLOPPA!!!!!!!!!!!!
"""lesser anteater"" sounds like an enemy from a rpg game lol, like ""lesser undead"" xD"
they brought a floppa
Knoxville was about to make another jackass movie with that little croc
"the floppa is stronger, is matter, is better is better!!"
this johnny guy is just annoying
"Kimmel, Knox and floppa!!!!!!!"
Jimmy is not amused
OMG BIG FLOPPA!!!

"A floppa is actually called a caracal,they are from countries Congo"
"I a, so happy big floppa showed up"
4:35 BIG FLOPPA
"It's funny how they're talking about how dangerous this cat is, then he gets shy and hides behind his handler.  I'm getting some Cowardly Lion vibes!"
aww cute floppa
If the audience would stay quiet when the animals are out then the animals might stay calm.
Knoxville is such a sweetheart
The floppa made it. Finally we get attention!!!
Yall i know the floppa is a wild cat but its so cute
"Caracal!  Aww, I want one!"
Jimmy Kimmel is a coward and a wimp.
I love FLOPPA
that 4 eyed guy is annoying and disrespectful. hate these kind of people.
jimmy is such a little baby
I'm surprised the caracal didn't go nuts. This African cat is no joke. He would hurt an American pitbull.
the toucan was awesome.
What's this big floppa? And why the f*ck is he acting like such an idiot douchb*g
Floppa is famous

Floppa is the real star here.
FLOPPA :000000000
Fun to see people from US excited about animals that are super common for Brazilians
Elder floppa has joined
What is hecker doing here?!
Jimmy was very smart to keep distance. Animals will be animals. I'd be very paranoid as well.
"How can this even be allowed? We are the only ""animals"" doing things like this. Isn't it enough that we already have domesticated so many animals? What is this anyway, putting wild animals infront of you like some puppets? Yes, they are beautiful and cute, but come on... It's just sad...."
Not a fan of Kimmel but I had to watch the animals.  My daughter wants a caracal so bad.  nope!!
WHo else was here for Big floppa
ITS FLOPPA
OMG FLOPPPA
"Sorry thought that read ""Watch Johnny Knoxville hand feed Jimmy Kimmel to wild animals"" i would of watched that at least for a few minutes."

Back when jimmy Kimmel was good. Before the word trump ever entered his mouth.
"Fun fact floopas\caracals eat birds mices
And are like leapords"

Why doesnt jimmy kimmel like big floppa?
Man Johnny Knowville is the id really fitting in this show
Looks like hecker joined the show

flopa 4:48
8 years ago : its a carcal floppas in 2022 : am i a joke to you?
I like for the floppa
"""Terrible pets"" whenever I see one they are like stupidly well behaved and sweet. Except Plumbober, he's a bit aggressive. But Kimbo, Gosha, Gus, Marx, etc all seem like great animals. I think it's mostly how old it was when you got it, and if you treat it right. Gosha is living like a king and he seems chiller than nearly all housecats Ive met"
Whoever thought it was a good idea to feature Johnny Knoxville in this segment must have been batshit insane. Dude couldn't care less if he was hurt or not.
5:32 big cat:every second your not running I'm only getting closer
Floppa on national tv
