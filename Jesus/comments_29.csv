The look on Flash's face when Superman saw him coming was priceless.
Movie name
"enter scene 3:51 a beautiful reflection of a life taken, shattered to sand, trying to takeaway a peaceful dream, what is life without a dream? Empty."
Yeah Batman and Barry yeah there is no way they should have survived this fight.
This movie proves that even if a director has such a beautiful mind blowing story line it can ruin a blockbuster movie.
Every man's weakness. Super bobs and vegene.
"2:22
Shit just got serious!!!"
Letter superman https://youtube.com/shorts/RM9T5OGrxLI?feature=share
Pet cemetery
Clark its me Fat Batman
Movie name?
"wtf, fat batman?"
What name movie
I am asking myself... why are they making different superheroes when superman could just take em all at once
aquaman gay
Me missing and Me Batman And Me From WWE
Me missing and Me Batman
I like the Flash more after the last movie
Batman be like - I was in traffic
"""Arthur, we need to restrain him!""

*AQUAYEETED!*"
"https://youtu.be/AC4rTALSUlY

next part"
If you're a normal human and you tick superman off you run for your life
such a terrible movie
"Flash - should we bow
Of course you should"
its so dumb they all just stood there. One of then just couldve took him away.
This movie was not very good in my opinion but this scene is amazing.
"I think that. If Superman goes crazy and he talk to me like that, I 100% probably sh*t my pants!"
Can't believe Henry Cavill and Gal Gadot faced off. I'm so very bi about this
"""remember who you are"" has Mufasa vibes"
"Flash *starts running using speed force*
Superman *locks eyes with him while running at full speed*
Flash: ""Why do I hear boss music?"""
"1:12 Kal-el no
It's like superman peed on the carpet and she's reprimanding him"
and pussy save the day...
They need one of those green crystals
"At that moment, Clark Kent became Homelander!"
Congratulation
"The worst and most false DC film ever made, there is not a single aspect that should not be rejected. DC better change direction before losing millions more, viewers are comics experts, so better choose authors and directors."
3:38 fly mode :active
2:50 Literally the only time we hear the Superman theme in any of his movies lol.
Yeah Superman is just overpowered. It's a little ridiculous at this point.
This movie is pure shit. Like all DC Universe
"Best fight in each and any movie. He is not confused or anything, he just woke up and gets you truly."
Harus jadii hafidh Al Quran
"God, who actually likes this shit?"
I liked the part where Superman is shown fast as barry but still a little bit slow
The only one pathetic to se was flashy making flash look weak even flash can still leave few hits on superman this movie every flash on DC live action movies with Erza Miller are pathetic. Enough said!
3:38 poor batman

Stupid cops pointing guns at him....
This scene is just so bad...
"once again it proved that women could calm down even an angry man
sale launde pighal bada jaldi jaate hai"
Henry Cavill the best Superman ever
1:36 1:38 1:40 1:43
"Batman : I have to make you humble again .
Bring up my green sword"
this was not a fun movie bc they made it impossible basically to beat him
overrated
laaaaame
movie name?
UHG DC
I like Lois casually revealing Superman's identity in front of the cops.
Yo flias mbombor claro
Movie name plz
"I feel The Man of Steel and Transformers have the same story, In Both movies Krypton and Cybertron are destroyed, and Megatron and Zod try to fix the planet, Optimus Prime and Superman choose humanity of Earth instead of rebuilding their home planet."
Movir neme ki
Goat Henry
Cgi is horrible but the concept was crazy
"Flash movie Barry can EASILY kill Kal now. One vibrate punch to the heart and it's over. Even an inexperienced younger Barry managed to kill bootleg Ursa and bootleg Non (with original Barry and BatKeaton's help). But the was laying waste to non-stop Kryptonians everywhere, and I loved every minute of it. Sadly, Barry during Justice League wasn't 100% sure of what he was really capable of."
Henry Cavill - the only person not wearing a costume and still looks like a Super Hero!!!!
"The CGI, The Acting... jeez this is just awful."
Gal Gadot sucks at acting. Not hating.
Henry cavil's face is the first thing I imagine whenever I heard Superman.Missing you in the superman suit.
KAL-EL NO!!
Movie name plse
Superman goes Terminator on their asses
i can watch this all day
"I wish Henry Cavill would beat the living hell out of Ezra Miller in real life, you can tell that psycho's never had his ass kicked before, and he needs it."
The way he threw batman
Lol flashs face
My fuckimg goodness can we all agree that Joss Whedon and superhero movies needs to stay in the past
Leebinbin
Wait so that cops knows superman is Clark
When you are a level 100 player and realised you accidentally skipped one of the early sidequests and decide to rush them.
Superman
One thing I hate about this era is that nothing feels real. Everything feels and looks like computer. There's no heart to any of it and all the actors suck
I can't stand the chick who plays Wonder Woman
I hate the actors and actresses that shows for all the superheroes. They're so annoying looking all of them
I hate the modern depiction of Superman. This generation sucks
Ilovebatmanandsuperman
This scene will never get old..
This is like watching people fighting in God mode in GTA.
3:01
"Am I the only one who found it a little odd when wonder woman was talking normally while using all her powers to pull superman at the stairs? Like at least make it look like you're struggling. Idk if it's bad acting or bad writing, but its definitely bad. These small things and details are actually the reason I prefer the mcu"
"Superman is smart. He saw wonder woman about to unleash the shockwave (probably the same level as superman impact) from her bracelets, so he put his hands in between to prevent them from touching."
It gets boring quick because everyone is in God mode and nobody can get hurt or win.
2:26 dekh Zara piche murke chali kaha aise urke
batman gained some pounds
"1:41 ""Nigga please..."""
One of the best cinematic moments EVER
He reacted to Aomine in the zone!!
And this is why Superman is Superior to all the heroes. He's unstoppable. If kryptonite was very very rare and nearly impossible to get you might as well call Superman God. Lol. He will always be the best and strongest super being.
Flash throwinf some ninjutsu
I am a bit confused if it The flash or the slow
was this before or after Ezra molested those minors
This could be the stupidest thing I've ever seen.
Second strongest is Wonder Woman
Super cool hero
Yo why Batman looking a lil chubby lmao
He gave the Criminal offensive side eye
Is no one going to talk about the police officer pointing his gun at Superman at the end?!
I didnt know this existed. I guess ppl saw potential and made Invincible cartoon for grown ups after this
Man he would have been perfect for an Injustice 2 part film
The dialogue is corny - but the scene where he looks at Flash is so cool.
Movie name kya hai
"""Arthur, we need to restrain him""...  And ""please don't make me do this""? Seriously? The level of arrogance radiating from this chic is mind boggling. What brilliant genius put the chic in charge?"
They really made a huge mistake firing henry cavil
Khalel no
Damn this fight is shit lol
The cast was on point for this.  It's really too bad they never got a good screen play or director.
Gunns superman will NEVER be this good
"Ezra Miller has such a dumb face, and was an awful flash. Glad his movie bombed and I hope that freak of nature never gets another role."
*Bring criptonite next time...*
Epic.  I'm going to miss him as superman
"I do love the implication that out of all of them, WW is the only that is closest to Supes in terms of strength. I'm haven't caught up in the comics but from what i know shes supposed to be the strongest right now right?"
"THe only good part in this scene is when Barry realizes that Superman, while still slower, is fast enough to be able to see and react to him."
Henry Cavill is the best Superman imo. Cool dude irl too so that just solidifies it for me.
Anyone know kind of pants he is wearing?
"Batman, may went out with no armor but he always has a plan."
I love superman is superior to wonderwhore in this scene
"Where in the fucking Hell did she hear the name Kal El? call him Clark or Superman, you weirdo. I think they just enjoyed how Kal El sounds in Gal Gadot's accent."
The fight would have looked a lot more interesting if it did not have Gal Gadot. Her expressions look fake and unnatural.
echo de menos a cyborg
"*Green Lantern left the chat*
*Martian Manhunter left the chat*
*Hawkman left the chat*
*Green Arrow left the chat*"
Superman shoulda killed Batman.
"When the last people in the school fight 
Flash: the athletic kid 
Wonder Woman: idk 
Cyborg; the rich kid 
Aqua man: the kid who is always at the pool 
Superman: the kid who drank the blue acid at the science class
Batman: quiet kid"
Captain skinny legs doesn't disappoint.
Move name plz
Opposite to Dalal is Galal
Just like a transgender competing in women's sports.
"Out of Flash, Cyborg, Aquaman, Wonder Woman, and Batman... Clark remembers the ass beating Bruce gave him lol. The only one without metahuman powers was able to give him a hard time. Also, wtf was that cop thinking lol."
YOU SHOULD GO SEE THE FLASH
best Superman ever!
That slap was personal
Superman ia sucks
How to put on a condom for beginners
When Asian kids do math
When Black kids fight the whole family
Run B Run!!!!!
"A transgender vs Black People
I'm the guy in the red"
"An alien has chest hair like a human, thats intresting"
Falta de criatividade kkkk
An evil superman no one would stand a chance not even Thanos
O my god he's naked
"That its the final and published version of movie? cause it looks terrible, like made by amateurs and i've seen better jobs done by amateurs"
"2:22 Superman's POV
What is this weak ass speedy dude gonna do."
They pretty much nerfed down all the members of the justice league in this movie. That's what happens when a fan boy writes the script.
Still cracks me up how they edited the facial hair off supermans face because he was dedicated to some other movie and he wouldn't shave it off.  WTF.
I never got the pet cemetery joke...
"they shoulda did a rewind after the entire encounter btwn superman & flash & then played out the fight AGAIN but not in slow motion but in real time for everyone ELSES perspective us & The justice league that is to show how it looked to the rest of the justice league . one minute theyre all holding ( being held by ) superman next minute theyre spun off into whereever the fuck lmfao then superman is gone & flashs lightning/electricity from his movements is zappin around & those stone obelisk things are just shattering in random spots with fist sized holes popping into them . then they stop moving & the league is just like "" cannot compute wtf jus happened . error error """
"""The big gun"" 
Aka.
Lois."
movie nem plz
Only Henry Cavill love
Underrated scene
"When you see just how truly powerful Superman really is, that is when you realize that Superman's greatest superpower is actually his morality.  Can you imagine how horrific it would be if a normal human being had that kind of god-like power?"
Such power and confidence
me that has a smol piece of criptonite
What is movie name
I want to know what wouldve happened if wonder woman was able to do her forearm cross thing on him
Clear as SparX Claire's
"Looks like a very low budget CGI movie, the fights hitting heads each other without feeling anything, it's like a fan made After Effects edit."
Suparman my favorite
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NcEF85jtvI
"superman is not faster than flash, superman would not take out Wonder woman so easy, and GOKU would %100 kick supermans ass"
the cop pointing his gun at superman when lois gets out. lmfao
"That was the best scene of the movie, but I still think superman was too OP. Wonder Woman and Aquaman could stand toe to toe on a fist fight with superman, they just don't have all his other abilities."
"I always wondered why, if superman can exist in the realm of the flash, how come he doesn't just fight everyone good or bad at that speed?"
"Superman glancing at Flash and fighting
him is one of the coolest fight scenes in
superhero cinema"
Superman is superior
"Imagine if Superman REALLY got angry and never held back. We have to keep in mind that Superman is ALWAYS holding back, even against Darkseid"
What's the name of the fucking film
Batman just got backhanded lol
sa
"Another comment from the 2017 film version, Barry says he just pushes people when he encounters bad guys. Usually it works however, 2:56, can't push an immoveable object."
It's good that Barry can understand that krpytonians can move almost as fast as him because this knowledge will come in handy when he faces off with Zod and co. in The Flash (2023)
"The actor who plays the flash is a criminal creep pervert loony tune. Have u heard what he has done? They are trying to rebuild his PR because he has a contract as the flash but it's not working because he messed with underage kids and gave them Drugs and brainwashed them like a cult leader. I couldn't believe how many times this guy has been arrested and let go. Must be nice to be rich and famous and get away with murder almost 
Ridiculous. Look him up. Has a strange name too like Raza or something, couldn't get over how crazy he is. Definitely a psychopath"
Falling angel taking women as their own  ... hmm sounds like the Bible
God that cgi did not age well.
Superman will always be the lamest superhero ever . Literally just gave him every super power and he still sucks !
Was Diana knocked out after the slam?  She seems to disappear
Bro ye movie hindi me kaha per available hai
Am I the only one who thinks Gal Gadot is a bad actress?
Clark:Tell Me Do You Bleed?
thats what happened when my wife call and ask me to throw rubbish outside when im playing games.... just look at her and stop do whatever im doing..... superman also scared of his women
And Alien Is Powerful literal Demi Gods And Gods Could Not Stop Him Superman is one of kind

Bruh. This shit looks like it was made by a low budget youtube organization. This cannot be a real movie.
4:08 do you bleed
Even when Batman is wrong. He won't own up. He didn't have to. He just thought!! He had to. Batman most overrated super hero. Has a super bank account.
He just that nicca aside like unwanted salad!
ain't no wakanda here.. MMHMMM
What movie is this
3:38 that wouldnt have moved Chris Rock like that.
ON iF requireD______________/_______________//_____________________///__________________________//_______
i like when super man fart on cam
Superman is gangsta until the batman from batman vs Superman joins the chat
"This video is proof that Superman is faster than the Flash. Look how he sees him coming... HAHAHA, Superman has always been super overpowered but I guess it makes sense because he isn't from this planet and the Sun and Earth's gravity is giving him the powers he has. Superman is faster than a speeding bullet. Keep up flashy boy."
"To be honest if WW wanted she could've easily killed superman. Her sword can cut through doomsday's leg and chopped his hand right off. Her sword is magic, magic is a kryptonian weakness. So if she wanted she could've easily beheaded him. If he held out his hand his hand would've been chopped right off."
Batman shows up to a fight against Superman without Kryptonite? Yeah right
Superman is a loser
I beat Superman & Wonder Woman at the same time.
Barry allen be looking like a nerd damn im 5 years late.
How do I get the full English movie?
Mojja
I think only supergirl is stronger than him
Another iconic moment
there is only one man in 2023 worthy of wearing the red cape...
One Thor is = to 1000 supperman
"You know I will always remember that it's just a nightmare when Henry Cavill got kicked out from WB, I'll just played the Justice League unlimited theme to lift that kind of burden."
Hate these CGI.
Is movie ka nam kiya hie???
supermen  zor
When the man grab the education subjugation like this and be like what you even educate subjagate you keep him
wonder woman should body superman here this is so stupid
Movie name please
this has to be the most badass scene of DC history
1:39 BRUH YOU CANT HIT A GIRL
Best scene in the movie IMO
That one guy in the server who turned on creative mode
It's funny how easy superman took it on them
"Kind of silly how the brain dead cops are taking a defensive stance against Superman, like they're going to do something. Even more ridiculous than their failure at uvalde, Superman says defund the police."
If homelander meets the justice league
Peter
I am lost here. What's going on with superman and why is he being a shithead?
Thank god superman has beta traits
The way diana said kal-el no is my favorite part
Trast budget= trash
"super man alien , wonder woman idk supposed to b d daughter of a god , alien beats wonder woman someone explain this to me"
What movie or show is this?
The fight choreography is shit
Batman and Superman switched bodies at the last second
"I'm sorry but I HAVE to say this;
Gal's line-read at 1:12 when she says ""Kal-El, no!"" was SO terrible. Why did the editors decide to use that take?"
Foumla of cap can be in Batman due to HERNA fought in war and actual war as well place in book good reason why
Quick tour 1947 part 3 coney island west before 67 split bullshit world war one and 1-3 first one captian america I went with DC for documents of amty of delete by Obama data threiver is alive no Tom Halland either it way wrist obsession marvel
"Him assessing that barry was the main threat while contending with 3 other supers is just testament to how powerful flash potentially is and how clark is also strategic and not just all brawl like he was when he switched to the only ""real"" threat and possible counter to Supes, The Bat."
That backhand slap on batman was personal
Why dose super man wants to kill his friends ?
Is super man the best  super guy ?
dont forget that batman didnt try to fight hr can hold superman good  if he wants to
Fr fr flash looks like he's korean
Why is Superman naked?
Flash is just so innocent
Why wonder woman always trying to save batman from superman hahah
3:02 the flash movie coming up soon
The women warrior an coulpe of gay warriors was just confused. ( These days)
Kopie von marwel civil war
whats the name of the movie?
Can we all collectively admit this movies cgi was awful?
2:22
200 million views. Just goes to show you that THIS is what the movie should have been.
The coolest moment superman see flash in light speed he wanna br a troll face meme
2:22 HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
Evil Superman vs justice league. Cool
That slap was personal batman
super men deckulwe fjufajt
The color grading in this version of the movie is so so bad
"Wonder woman at 3:18
also Wonder woman 16 seconds later 3:35"
"how could someone be such a good actor with such a greek god look.
i ain't gay at all but Henry Cavill be looking a full course meal."
Lois calming him down gives me Natasha and Hulk vibes.
In DC comics justice league there was no cyborg it was flash superman Batman Aquaman green lantern hawk man superman will never attack his colleagues since it is forbidden on his planet and he's oath is protected people of earth from lex luger and legion of Doom and Wonder woman too superman protect especially in the early years of DC comics not the cartoon version
"Perfection after some level of development excludes any enemy side. Requiring the growing level of clear state, views etc. Being endless in development."
Bombastic Side Eye
"So how the shittin fuck did Batman beat him? I swear, DC is soo fucking stupid. Their writers have got to be the fucking stupidest demetia patients ever. One movie dude gets killed by Batman. Now all of a sudden he can overpower Cyborg, WW, AND Aquaman at the same time, and then movie fast enough to overwhelm Flash. Shit is garbage."
What a terrible movie. Jesus Christ.
The scariest part of this is the way he asks batman if he bleeds while crushing his throat slowly. Funniest is the flash looking like he shit bricks when supes looked at him like I see your ass then tossed everyone else to chase him. Lmao
1:12 how is she an actress?
Jesting League :D
I remember reading a comic where he once sneezed and obliterated an entire solar system
after MARVEL series this is so GAY :D
Yeah right Hulk will kick his ass like nothing
wtf is it with DC wanting EVERYONE to fight superman
how retarded can those 2 cops can be at 4:40 ? Pointing guns at someone who literally wrecked the shit outta wonder Woman.
3:26 that was really a personal revenge
Lol threw batman like a paper towel
Batman to pizda..
"Superman toying with Batman is more like it, unlike the mess that is Batman v Superman, where Batman wins.  Do me a favour."
Jesus the cgi is terrible
99999
Ahh no stupid aspect ratio
lol
How is this 4K HDR when it has been encoded dumbasz.
"Selalu nonton pas adegan ini
Lucu flash ^^"
Excellent Video
no no no this movie suck it's bad guys FREAKING BAD MOVIE  JUSTICE LEAGUE BOX OFFICE BOMB NO MORE HENRY CAVILL SUPERMAN NO MORE BEN AFFLECK BATMAN MOVIE GUYS GUYS HEARD NEWS DCEU GOING TO END MEAN DCEU IS DEAD
How did he have time to move when flash was running
Sun's getting real low in the sky big guy.
Superman hi
"I hate how Louis is just used as the De-escalation prop in this movie. ""Clark! Clark..."""
If he could move that fast then why didn't he in the first place
How superman see flash flash has lighting speed
"By God, that was awful."
Crappy movie
https://youtu.be/ilUxZAVh-SE
Such trash....
In my opinion flash is the only one  who can stand a chance  against  superman
"0:08
Ok, it's subtle, but they are playing the original superman movie theme here, and it gives me chills."
3:33 My superiority complex be like.
"I honestly hated how it tried to do basically marvel comedy, It did not fit this scene or any other parts of the movie whatsoever. Snyder Cut FTW."
"That look on Superman's face when he tells Batman 'Tell me , do you bleed' is so menacing.."
The CGI is atrocious for a 2017 DC film.
I think that superman woke up there with more power.
avengers EKIBI SAPLAR
Everyone gansta until Superman goes into creative mode
Technically wonder woman strong enough to beat super man
I was not crazy for this move but I love him as superman and I can not watch this sceene too often
"Say what u want about this movie 
But the scene is bad ass only if it went longer"
Can we just respect the moment he throws Ben Afleck who dressed up as Batman like he was a bugger on his finger
"Batman: the world needs you
Superman: but does it need you?"
"Let's rephrase that Wonder Woman shall we?
He's back to kick your ***.


Sorry Children."
How Superman threw Batman away
Marvel is far better
"When Wonder Woman lassoed (sp?) his arm with the lasso of truth lol, Superman should've said ""Yes, that outfit does make your butt look big"""
superman is op
In 2:18 clearly it is visible that superman is not holding wonder woman's throat then wonder where actually he is holding?
the Officier on car 8202 was devoted
3:35 bro turned on creative mode
they nerfed wonder women so bad she could have at least put up more of a fight
I think it's pretty badass that Wonder Woman headbutted Superman.
Really bad acting
Movie name ??
"Do U bleed 
Probably the coldest yet scariest moment for batman"
Mowgli
I love how when he throws Batman away it sounds like a bath towel hitting the floor.
My hero
Wonder mommy
1:13 kkkkkkk
Flash is so much faster than Superman in this scene but he was still super inexperienced in fighting someone this powerful
L VFX
everyone wanna burry their heads inside superman's hairy chest.
Wich the movie
4:10 revenge granted
Immortal Clark Kent with Heroic Superman
"lol superman just told batman  his own line ""tell do you bleed""  
batman be like: you will 
he ordered alfred to get the big gun meaning lois
and if batman told alfred to get the kryptonite then rip superman again lloll"
The cgi police cars are EMBARRASING. They would've been better off using cardboard cutouts
"expectations of you winning a bully fight:

enimem: *SNAP BACK TO REALITY-*"
The justice league couldn't handle him but there is a bat and a man can guess who he is
The acting from all parties is terrible and this is staged like a highschool play. Whats insane is Zack Snyder directed most of this.
Iaspjo
This whole scene is based on no one talking to Supes and Cyborg not being able to control his own weapons. It's just absurd.
How the video is 5 yr old?
That's whe he knew he fucked up....
Gal Gadot acting in this scene is atrocious
"I'm sure we know but although that super headbutt to WW looked pretty brutal, she took it well and got back up without a scratch. I always thought thre would be a quick scene later in the movie when SM comes to his senses saying to her ""look...Diana...about before..."" and she says ""Save it!"" lol"
i hate you flashback FM got subscribers 7.57m subcribers. all dc fan comments like josstice league ruin dceu it's really bad movie disgusting. man at steel 2 is cancelled and ben affleck the batman movie is cancelled. all dceu project  shut down. james gunn reset into dcu. like matt reeves the batman better than ben affleck because kill people. i'm done dceu. dceu is dead. i hate you I hate I you I hate you I hate YOU I hate YOU I hate YOU I HATE YOU FLASHBACK FM AND DCEU GONEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.

YOU SUCK FLASHBACK FM AND DCEU DIDN'T MAKE MONEY. GOODBYE FLASHBACK FM YOU'RE STUPID DCEU DISAPPOINTED IN ME
R7er
There are so many questions with this fight: Why did Cyborg's defense system only work in this scene and no others? Why didn't Flash immediately try to move him out of the way so he didn't hit Superman? Why didn't Cyborg immediately apologize right after that happened? And why didn't any of them bring some small amount of Kryptonite to subdue him if they couldn't hold him off physically?
No more mr nice SUPER MAN.
But Batman won a fig...FOH!
Supermen t geroy
When Superman went full Omni man.
when ww keeps calling supermans name always got me
oooooo    wow
3:39
3:28
best part is where the jew is headbutted into the concrete
I feel like this acting and animation is just so bad
I saw them on dogstyle on only fans the girl and super man.
"Henry Carville, the best super man ever."
When Superman resurrected he got a new power which is a Superhuman speed like Speedster.
"they really though they could restrain him, lol"
Banenena spelling
Abu Dhabi 1 dhs
20dollars twenty 20 pounds eqauk vision views the view
WOW Superman owned the Justice League without even trying plus I bet Henry and Gal Gadot were secretely dating behind her husband's Back!
OMG AND THERS WONDER WOMEN OMG This is a hero movie in marvel
Also we see later that superman is much faster than the flash.
Why when superman hits wonder women she only goes back about 12 feet but when superman hits general zod who is as strong as superman he goes flying .
This entire scene is a comedy from a cinematic perspective.
"I like how he could defeat them all,
but one person with krytonite just negs him (expect CAS)"
3:26 luv this part
""
gal gadot really deserved that for such bad acting
thor is enough for Superman
"How does a horrible actress like gal gadot get such big roles, could it be because she's.... you know..."
The flash was the only one that had a to defeat superman if was just a little faster and had some fighting experience he whould have won
When they try to section you but you lift and do martial arts.
It's insane how they could throw away such potential. We never even got our MoS 2.... like wtf.......
the best part is when he throws batman away like some tattered piece of cloth
"Man they should have taken all the footage from first JL and then added it to Zacks. Its like both movies have parts that the other doesn't. I really liked Justice League, dont know why it didnt do better, although the parademons were cheesy. They should have also had way more superman IMHO"
"WW, Cyborg, Aquaman, Batman = Your classmate who just messed up the school electrical outlet.
Superman = Your teacher, who is looking for a troublemaker.
Flash = You, who is sneaking out of the classroom."
yoestoestoestoestoes
"The face he makes after cyborg launches the ice at him. ""nope"""
Movie name!!!
Superman face is funny 1:43
Is Superman a bad guy?
The way he throws Batman away
Superman is confused how perfectly spaced each character is from each other
That disrespect to batman
It must've pain batman fans when he was toss like a peace of garbage .......
One of the things i hate bout bro their strongest memeber is also the biggest threat
1:12 ... that line delivery was SO DAMN BAD
weast
I like how Superman doesn't discriminate and gives fair share of beating to everyone
"What a mess, bad acting, bad circumstances (Henry Cavill's face was CGI'ed) and horrible movie."
The fact he flew up and pimp slapped Batman
gal gabot is annoying
Yeah yeah alright he threw batman like nothing beacuse of women.
The effortlessness he displays while fighting them is really unsettling. 10/10.
I just love it when Superman sees Lois Lane. The first thing he does is Yeet batman offscreen.
"i like how superman didn't grab ww's neck instead,  that's my superman"
Wait no this Josstice League. The parody of Justice League.
If you ever feel useless just remember the cop that pointed a gun at Superman .
why does batman look like fat batman from dark night
3:38 - 4:00 me when my friend tries to kill me in Gmod
Imagination at it's peak
Why batman look so fat
This film needed alot of help!
What if Green Lantern and Shazam were there?
Real OG Henry cevil is just the my superman
With that speed it doesn't make sense that how the bullets even hit him in dawn of justice?????
Ima be real. Flash's suit has the most drip out of all these heros
3:35 he's like take dat bitch
Only Batman can beat him
Really cool scene. Man Henry was such an awesome Superman.
It was her simple please ;)
"my guy just actually tossed batman away like he was random enemy #6, after seeing lois."
Homelander fighting the seven wow
Imagine 2050 how movie magic vfx edit look like
Why do they make the Flash so ineffectual?  He would have been the one to put up the best fight against superman.
MIND CONTROLLING_HALLUSINATION
So just watched the first wonder woman and I'm wondering why she didn't use the same attack on steppenwolf as she did on Aries? Flash(or whatever his name is) could have generated the same power she needed to hit steppenwolf. But then we wouldn't have needed superman. Hmmm
Batman Be like :- It's a great insult
movie name pls
"Who think WW is strongest DC girl they should have watch this, Maxima can fight Supes one on one"
Aqua man jumping at superman to be simply hit away is aqua man on land summed up
*tosses batman* thats all.

Damn this movie sucks
We're going to miss the MCU
"One part I was always confused at was before he threw Arthur and wonder woman, how did the cyber guy just get thrown away without superman even touching him? All while the cyberguy had his thrusters on full capacity going at him!?"
Just so hilarious the way it's sounded when superman threw batman away like a blanket
"Supes couldnt even lay a hand on The Flash. Just FYI lol. The Flash is the best character ever lol. He has the ability to beat everyone, but routinely does not because hes Barry lol. Thats what makes The Reverse Flash even better and scarier."
The man tossed Batman aside like a used sock
"Yeah, superman all gangster until Batman gets prep time"
3:34 I love this

So Superman turned his head at the same speed flash was running. He threw the other justice league members off of him at that same speed. He shouldn't be able to do that. And they should've been obliterated. Then he had a fight with Flash while they WW and AM were still in the air. Like watch and imagine it in normal speed. How DC? How?
Bro liget bitch slapped batman
"Ninja flash, fat bat, aqua bro, skinny borg, and Gal Gadot vs CGI lipman. What a shame this all was, so much potential wasted."
I sware they made the flash looks gay af.
Personally I always felt supes should have beaten them all bloody

O Batman estava em choque

Clark.....
If superman was chinese he would have made a bat soup in this scene
So you mean to tell me people still don't know Batman is Bruce Wayne after seeing this
I will make sure to watch it Again THX
3:34 my dad beating my mom and i after coming home to no beer

Henry is a legend

Bro was exploiting

"I didn't like how they made Batman look like a bitch, sure he would lose badly in this scenario but they just had to rub it in"
this is sooooooo cool
"Yeah.. they made a big mistake getting rid of Henry Cavill as superman.. only 2 supermen ever.
Christopher Reeve (RIP) and Henry Cavill are the only supermen."
Whats the name of movie?????
Superman is the one guy with the Chinese Username that absolutely carries the team.
We need more Henry cavill superman
Superman using just 1% of his powers
"Notice at 2:51. Hey, that's the classic Superman theme. The one John Williams made."
I love how supermans hair is perfectly combed even tho he just came back from the dead
The cop with the gun you might as well throw a juice box cause all it will do is piss him off
3:38 Realistic Batman vs Superman battle.
Finally a true depiction of what a fight between Batman and Superman would look like.
3:37 When you go into Creative mode
The fact these motherfuckers couldn't beat him but fucking BATMAN could beat his ass with a fucking green crystal is disappointing
The power of love....
Not enough people are pointing out how much this feels like they are on a studio lot with Green screen. This shit looks terrible
"him:""how fake do you want this to be?""                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               superman:""yes"""
Bayer irama
I really need that cyborg movie though lol
What was the Flash trying to achieve? Run past Superman really fast??
"Superman:beats the justice league without speaking
batman arrives
also Superman: Do you bleed"
Flash weave game on point tho
"Superman: ""Do you bleed?""

Batman: ""Yes""

Superman: ""What?""

Batman: ""What?"""
I like that scene when superman gives wonder woman a better head
You know what I'd like to see?  Dr. Strange vs. Superman crossover where neither holds back.  No mind control this or that.  Each sees the other as a legit threat and Strange goes Thanos level medieval on Superman and Superman goes all fighting Doomsday level threat on Strange;  yeah give me THAT.  Just a random thought I figured I'd share.
Toss batman like a peace of shit
Watch James Gunn make Superman a tranny and erode any credibility DC has left
Bruh ngl all the characters in dc are attractive and perfectly fit for the roles.
I never like this versions of characters
"Superman: ...I think I remember you now. I came to you a long time ago, asking for my money back. And, I'm gonna say to you what you said to me then... ""@#$% off."""
The way he soloed ww is still funny
Wow nicee

That cop with a f*cking 9mm pistol I can't right now I'm dead
"Wonder women: kal el No! 
Superman: kal el Yes ."
"They stand no chance against Superman
The whole team is Down basically within a min"
"The world needs you, but doesn't need you, reverse Uno xddd."
Why the witcher is topless?
The power of Boners is even stronger than Superman!
"After gaining much more popularity from the witcher series and mi fallout, imagine how much the man of steel 2 could possibly gross, so sad we won't see him again wearing the cape. Sure reeves was great but cavill  pulled superman into another level his portrayal his built and his impact is so perfect, love it or hate it. I've said this before and ill say it again mos2013 was ahead of its time,mos2 could potentially reach billions if it wasn't for wb poor decision making"
Funny how everyone hates when they fire an actor but y'all will love the next Superman even more than Henry.
Wonder woman in the comics is way closer to Superman in power. The movie version is nerfed but not by much.
What is this movie called?
Wow this movies sortve fire when Superman is present and no one is talking
I like the cops. Still hangin in there with a pistol after witnessing all that.
"BIGASS DC L
L ON TOP OF L ON TOP OF L
Firing this man... and recasting almost everyother hero, can't peice the universe together to cringe ass movie direction.
And why I'm so pissed was that DC had major potential and stuff like this was fun and now its over..."
"Wonder Woman: Please don't make me do this.
Superman: I don't think you can."
Where can I watch this movie? Please help
Name movie?
"Say whatever you want against superman, but you'll have to accept 1:13 is the most badass a superhero can get"
"""Kal-El no"" said Wonder Woman"
Man it's so sad that DC can't see how great Henry Cavill is as superman honestly a real shame they're recasting. So much potential down the drain
Henry is a superb actor too which barely anyone talks about...
First 200m view's video for DC
"I love how wonder woman just says ""no"" to anyone doing anything she doesn't want. Like everyone gotta listen to her lmao"
NO MAN OF STEEL 2 SEQUEL IS CANCELLED. GOING TO REBOOT SUPERMAN WITH JAMES GUNN. NO MORE WONDER WOMAN 3 IS CANCELLED. NO MORE BLACK ADAM SEQUEL. THAT MEAN THIS END OF DCEU 2013-2022. i'm not happy justice league whedon cut is wrong. this is snyder cut. you give like 1.6 million this is WRONG. MOVIE IS BAD FREAKING BAD.

I simply can't comprehend why Gal Gadot is pushed so hard by Hollywood and she is clearly a very bad actress.
Bruh cyborg needs to get his equipment together
"Aquaman: Hi
Superman: Bye"
"0:57 love superman he balled his fist and was ready to go to work no guns needed...
Henry Cavill will always be Superman!!!!"

while im sad to see henry go from superman i am keeping an open mind i want to see a proper DCEU not the up and down mess we have gotten i think restarting the entire DCEU is the best option in the long term

"""Aquaman, you know there's water literally right behind you"" that's what any of them should of said"

"My favorite part is Flash starts running to help of thrice but the way Superman looks him and Flash shocked.... and another one Superman asks  Batman, Tell me do you bleed....... Its really awesome."
Wow nice movie

Love how he tosses Batman away like nothing
Never noticed the original Reeves Superman motif hidden in that music before. Long time since I've watched Josstice League.
kal el no
Wow
This goes to show just how weak Batman is when he's not protected by comic book plot armor. Especially towards the end  fight with Steppwolf and the previous end fight with Doomsday. Batman couldn't do nothing but stand there.
Bruhh the slap to batman always get me everytime i watch this movie
Super manS Worst enemy is Bat man tho
I hate the adds
Pussy> justice league
Back here after the reboot announcement..... Cavill was the best Superman
I just don't want to see another superman movie unless Henry is the one playing the roll. Period.
Best superman ever huge mistake DC
Henry 4 life superman !!!
Poor Batman had to run all the way over there
Pero A ti no
When Wonder Woman said dont make me do this...i asked myself wtf could you possibly do ?
Is he cyborg
"Henry Cavill, the best superman, bring him back!!!"
Best superman ever
"*Drops wallet*
Bacteria rushing towards it: 2:14

"Half of me is glad he didn't kill batman there,  the other half says its ben affleck rip his jaw out .lol  Don't worry you can always send the flash  to bring back christian bale."
How Warner Bros and DC can no longer want him as a Superman after a scene like this. You really have to be crazy or blind.
homelander
THis flash and batman- just dont look right face wise to me
3:37 that bitch slap tho
What kind of feeble-minded cretins are these movie slops designed for?
