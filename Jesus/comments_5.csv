After 3 coats of clear gloss... There is some haziness from paint I believe.  What shall I do to get absolutely clear glass now?
"""Ive seen headlights that cost 250 each"" meanwhile the new volvo xc90 are almost dubbel the price (each)..... its a shame"
"hey Chris ,, thank you for the video 
I tried it on my headlights but the paint wrinkle what should I do"
Is this same method good for the rear headlights too?
You can make this process a lot easier if you just remove the headlights before working on them.
 I did 400 to 1000 to 3000 to 5000 to 10000 nut no clear coat. Thanks will have to do that.
"Hey, can I use anny other carwax or do I need to use especially this wax?"
Followed Fix's instructions.  Headlamps look worse than before.  Now I need to buy new lamps.
I've done this before the clear will start flaking in time it's just a temporary fix
Fantastic sauce
It worked beautifully !
"I followed every step in this video and the headlight turned out great... Before the clear coat that is. After the 2nd layer of clear coat, I noticed that cracks started forming in the clear coat. A third layer didn't help much either and the final headlight was crystal clear, but had cracks in the clear coat. What did I do wrong? Did I layer it on too much? I waited 5+ minutes in between coats. Also after wet sanding to prime for the wax, the clear coat turns very hazy. Am I sanding it too much or not enough?"
My headlights have gone all hazy
So if I buy a new headlight can I just spray with the clear coat and it will do better in the long run?
just did and shared your link !!!!!    you are an awesome teacher !!!
Would it be an good idea to do this on a car with very little fade on the lights in order to stop it in the future? Or should i only do it on a car with worse fade
"Not $10 a light. It came out to $33 a light, but thanks for the tips."
"You are so clear with your instructions anyone can do this! Every time I thought of a question, you totally addressed it in the next clip. Thanks so much!"
"Well. I am almost done. Applied a coat to each headlight. Looked fantastic, except mine dried in a 'cracking' pattern, the way mud cracks when it dries. Then, I applied a 2nd coat to each. Still looked clear although the cracking pattern persisted. Finally, put on a third coat on the passenger headlight -and it now looks CLOUDY compared to before and compared to the driver-side. I shook the can very well each time. PerHAPS, I didn't wait quite five minutes after the first coat. PerHAPS that psgr light was more in the shade while the driver side was getting some sun when I did this. 

I sure hope the right side clears up. :( I won't know what to do. Start standing and praying?"
Starting on my daughter's 07 Sebring. Nervous the lenses are also foggy on the inside.
Does this method work on the taillights as well?
My headlights are starting to very faintly show some haziness.  The toothpaste seemed to eliminate this.  Could I then apply the clearcoat and not go through the wetsanding process with sandpaper?
I got spiderwebs on some parts for some reason... Anyone know why!?
Did I put too much clear coat on? All I have is haziness and cracks in the haziness
"In my country I cannot find the 2k clear coat what else can I use instead to do the job? I already tried what the video says but used something that wasn't the 2k clear coat and after one day it didn't dry out, when I wiped it off manually (after 24h) the headlights became hazy again and the horizontal scrathes that were made with the sandpaper 400, 600, 2000 are still visible.
Edit: Would you recommend the TURTLE WAX HEADLIGHT LENS RESTORER KIT? And if so would the kit work with the sanding that is already done to the headlight?"
Great video  I like that you did it without power tools would a two part clear be better and maybe a soft sanding block so not to leave impressions with your fingers
Imma give this a try on my 03 Benz be back soon
what are you mean
"saw this video 8yrs ago when you first uploaded it Chris, didn't need it then, but man is it coming in clutch today. Bought a truck (Dodge RAM) and the state safety inspection. Just got back from Home Depot and about to put this video to work. Thank you!"
"Chris, I'm doubtful with no real reason to be! You don't tend to fail us, so I'm gonna try it."
Anyone from 2023 have luck with this?
"Hi I am restoring my headlights and I have some issues. I have 2 forum threads if you search on Google with this phrase ""HELP! Headlight restoration swirls showing!"" you can see my progress. I am currently stuck and would like some feedback. I removed all the previous headlight clear coat with 800 grit, so I am left with just plastic. However trying to get a mirror finish with the visbella kit compound and a wool pad is not working. I can still see sanding marks. Should I keep polishing until all marks are gone or should I apply the liquid and the marks will disappear?"
Great tutorial. Thanks for sharing
"My lesson was as I did not have and cannot buy Rustoleum 2x clear coat, the result was disappointing, hazy. Then I realized I had to triple the coat I used, then it cleared out. Had done it before with 2 other cars few years ago, but this time some other painter's coat.. Just for the community"
"I've seen dozens of these vids to remove the ""haze"" from these headlights....BUT...I don't see anything on a related problem--> I got my headlight as smooth and clear as a baby's behind....but the ""clear"" plastic seems to have taken on a yellowish tint all the way through. Is there a way to remedy this?"
Doesn't he have a newer video on this? I cannot find it watched it before but now I'm ready to do the work
Wow ty so much!
me watching this with my nice crystal clear headlights: interesting
"Cost of OEM BMW HID (Xenon lights) = $1200 new, Salvage = $800.   OEM Halogen = $800, $200-400 Salvage (my $200 had pits and scratches and a missing support.  I paid $150 for my stuff and it is still worth it.  But I wish i had seen this video first, lol."
Is the car wax necessary? Will it turn out differently if I dont use wax?
"what wax do we get mothers, meguiars??"
Thank you for showing us this. Mine came out perfect.
"ik this vid is old but i have a question, can i tint my headlight after this?"
it started looking more white i got scared
Very well explained. Excellent video.
"Been watching for multiple years and I just barely got my first car. I'm really excited to put some of these videos to use, including this one :)"
Hello I just tried this method on my Town & country 2014 on one headlight and it is very very hazy doesn't seem to be clearing up it's been about 10hrs... Does anyone have any suggestions
thank you Chris you've helped me alot
I just use compound and it looks brand new
"Hi chris been watching your video for a sometime now and tried many of your tutorial, just want to ask question, just tried this method with my Toyota Yaris 2015 here at Ph at found it difficulty on the edge part due to its concave, which make it hard to sand paper. Any advise? Cuz for the whole headlight it was same as your video but for the edges(concave) the yellow still there. Hope you can give me your expect advise. Thank you."
1:10 uh wtf?
The sanding takes oxadized plastic off and a newer plastic is exposed. The clear coat traps the solvent in the plastic from escaping keeping it fresh for years.
Hey Chris I did the steps but I never spray painted anything before and on the first clear coat application it came out runny AF and thick. I thought if I tried lighter sprays I could even it out. Now that its dried i can see all the marks from the run and now it's hard. What should I do to fix it ? Dry sand it with 200 grit and repeat it again or wet sand with 200 grit ? Thanks !
Do u have link for clear coat
"I went to a junkyard, a pick and pull in my area, pulled a headlight off of a 2010 prius. It was clear, but was missing all the bulbs and was full of water. 

They wanted to charge me $400 for the headlight. I was like WHAT? I asked to see their manager, the guy who prices them... I was like bro, just cuz I'm already here, I'll give you $60 for the headlight, but there is no way in hell you will sell it for $400 or anything close to that. 

He still rejected it and said he will 100% sell it to a refurbished for $350. I was like bro u delusional. 

So now I'm just gonna restore my yellow light for $10."
"I did this and it worked great! Only problem was I might have put too much paint on each time as I waited for the five minutes between coats and it ended up ""crackling"" so I had to start over.  Less paint and maybe more time between coats or else you have to start over."
"Hi Chris, I'm just about ready to start this process for the first time and I was rewatching your video and noticed in the description you have a polish which you don't mention in the video. My headlights are very foggy and yellow in my 2005 Lexus 2IS. I was wondering in which step would I be applying the polish?
Thanks a ton for all your clear explanations."
Still a bit hazy after all that clear and 24 hours
"This clearcoat will affect how the light shines through, this is shown on another video I watcehd, clearcoat bad."
"Firstly, love the channel, shows how simple some auto work is. So I tried this twice, but when I spray the lights  and it dries there are cracks in the coating. How would I correct that?"
"Nah. Not recommendable  for perfectionist customer and for eye detailer. 
Yeah its clear to look at distance but if you look closely theirs a big difference between clear coat to Sanding headlight  Restoration Result."
"Incredible Instructional. Magnificent results, actually. *THIS* is the method I choose to adopt; THE best, relative to others I've watched."
Chris is it ok to spray the clear coat on my brand new Mazda to prevent my headlights from turning into yellow lights in the future?
"Thanks Chris! I did this today and It turned out pretty good! I was a bit too carefull so I did 5 layers of clearcoat in total! I did the last coats a bit more heavy, and it turned out great!"
You should remove tape immediately after painting in any circumstance. Other than that this was perfect
"Blessings, John 3:16.  Jesus loves you."
"I followed these steps with my totally yellowed headlights on my 21 y.o. Opel Corsa.

I had no finer sandpaper than 600 grit. I gave it a try and it worked wonders. Done sanding within the hour.
Sprayed them in 4 layers. The result the next day was kind of dull. (Orange peel)

Since I didn't have any sandpaper to buff it up, I used Commandant M5 polish with a polishing pad on my cordless drill.

The end result really is amazing! And I still think the paint cures a bit more to full clarity.

This video saved me from buying new headlights, so thanks man! Total costs under $10,-"
Going to give this is a go !
Where do you get clear coat spray
@ChrisFix I follow the instructions but I made the mistake of accidentally adding too much of a clear coat. How do I go about fixing this problem?
You got a very useful channel. I still use some of your older videos. Ty
Does the car have to be stored inside after completion for drying. It's very hot here in the sun in SW Florida
@chrisfix what if the headlights are new and you just want to prevent them for yellow later? Would you wet sand with 2000 then clear or just clean and clear
"Hi Chris I recently bought a car and have the exact same problem hazy headlights, I've watched various videos on Youtube saying that you should use dish soap and water if this is true would it be better or could it make the lights worse?."
I remember my old roommate did the bug spray headlight fix thing to my truck without asking me beforehand and it chemically melted the f****** plastic
They have a whole kit at Harbor freight for $15
"Great video, clear, precise, and well-timed.  Thank you!!!!!!!!!  (note:  this not only improves the appearance and value of the vehicle, it also vastly improves your night vision)."
The clear coat starts to crack after a while.
This lasted about a year and a half for me. Not bad.
skipped the compound and or polish?  could be much clearer.
2023 here we go wish me luck
"To big step betwin 600 too 2000 sandingpapire paper 
Better to use dual action macinine  ,  500, 800 dry sanding, , 1000, 2000,2500 , 3000 weetsanding, before rubbing , it you have uv paint  save you the round of polishing  
I have do this jobs  of many head lamps.."
yeah mine dont look anything like this mine are really foggy
i also didnt use the 2000 grit i stopped at 600 i used 400 tehn 600 i forgot teh 2000 and i dont even think they sell 2000 grit at stores around here...if it doesnt turn out ill start over or at least start at the 2000 grit part and clear coat then wax it..i did the 400 and 600 but i mistakenly used 400 and left scratches when i shouldve been using the 600 at the time so one light has alot fo scratches
You are the G.O.A.T Chris. You are my go to for all things related to DYI vehicle projects
Is that a New York accent I hear at 10:00?
"I De-fogged the headlights on my wife's 2013 Corolla yesterday and it came out great!
More importantly, the lights on my Caravans, done years ago, are still looking great! Thanks, Chris!"
can I use liquid meguiars wax for the final step?
"Just done this to my vehicle, and it works. Saved me 600.00, thanks, bro"
"@Chris Fix; I have been subscribed to your channel for several years now, and I have not received one alert for one of your new videos. It's been about a year! I went onto your page, and find out that you put out videos in all that time. I don't know what it is or what's going on, but I'd like to see more videos from you. Whether it's a YouTube Problem, heaven knows. But, I would like to have an alert when you put on a new video. Your channel is one of the best!"
"I have used this method for years with great results every time! Thanks, Chris!"
"Ok, I'm asking here because this is new and driving me crazy.  What are they teaching in schools these days that makes people say things like; ""more gritty,"" ""more fine,"" more fast, ""more soft,"" ""more clean,"" ""more great.""  Are they not teaching the difference between comparatives and superlatives?  How to use adjectives?  I'm seeing more and more of these ""morons.""  Can anyone tell me why?  Am I the only one who has been noticing this recently?"
good explanation thanks
Really helpful and straightforward thanks mate!
Dude you got to be kidding me $29 for t-shirt what the hell are you smoking
Crazy seeing how far you came from your old videos man really glad to see you have come so far!
Not the way to go. It is better to polish it after sanding with finest grit paste and that put PU    (UV resistant) film on headlight
"Hey, I did it but after spraying the coat all the headlight look like its broke, and I sand it again with 2500 and polish and it still looks like broken what to do?"
Replacing the old headlight assembly with a new one is another option!
chriss how can repair the drips after 3rd spraying
you forgot to change the blinker fluid
what happens if i use satin clear and not gloss clear
"Thank you Chris. My 2008 MDX failed inspection due to yellowed/hazy headlights. Less than $50 at an auto parts store, and 30 minutes of my time, my headlights look brand new. Can't wait for 24 hours to do one more wet sand and then wax. You are a real treasure."
Ceramic kit from Walmart helped me.. I am very impressed with it.
"I just put on the 2nd coat of clear and my car headlights look amazing. To me the before looked even worse then the PT cruiser shown! Ill toss some wax on tomorrow. If I notice anything wrong ill be sure to update my post but for now this was a very quick, easy and apparently very good fix for yellow foggy lights. Just trust the process!"
"Question, if you did this and included overhead costs, how much would you charge people to do this and cut a profit each time? I know at the beginning he stated $10 a headlight but that was 8 years ago and inflation intensified. Any advice?"
Love the content I should have subscribed years ago
What alcohol do it work
"Just now finished my '05 Dakota....not bad....not bad at all!  Best part is that I already had all the stuff.  Took a couple of pictures but guess I can't attach them.  Anyway, Thanks, Chris....."
Clear coat don't last a year
May of 2023 the other stuff is about $32.
all those chemicals is messing up the headlight housing
Nice!  You are the man.  I've been around cars my whole life and didn't know about this trick.  Thank you sir.
i just replaced a new pair of headlights. A lot less work to buy new headlights than to Restore them. I try this method and doesn't last long.
Thanks
wow dude!!  I had  milky nasty headlamps  on the  Tucson..  I did  this... at the wax  stage  now and  depbating  if I should  wetsand the clearcoat..  I think I will just  carnuba them...  I cannot thank you enough  they  went  from milk/yellow  really bad..  to looking new.. wish I could send you a  pic..  I am thrilled thank youuuu!!!
Chris have you ever considered doing a video on how to upgrade your headlights to LED
"My lights are 1,100 each, absolutely ridiculous"
Can someone recommend a different gloss clear spray than rust-oleum. That I can buy on the European marked.
That was pretty easy Dude! Thanks! You make it look easy.
It shall be done
"I did this method, and though i didn't use the exact sandpaper grits, mine came out not perfectly clear and still fairly hazy on some spots. But it's better than doing nothing. This restoration method is a cheap way to do it, if you buy the Rust-Oleum (don't get 2k clear since it causes damage, expensive, and it's hard to remove). But if you have a power drill, get the 3m ultimate headlight restoration kit, 3m polishing compound bottle, and 3m orange finesse pad. It's the right way and will look better, and be removable for when the coating wears out. 

The main difference in process is that you make sure the headlight is very clear and smooth before applying the UV protection layer, use a UV protection designed for headlights that is easy to remove/won't damage the light. It costs a bit more but i would really recommend it since both took me the same amount of time. And apparently never use 2k clear since it's so strong, it'll be very difficult to take off and can actually cause small cracks in the headlight by temperature changes! 
The Headlight Restoration Pro channel shows the right way."
Thats was awesome! But I think PT cruiser head lights go fir about 2.99 each. I may be wrong???
"I just changed the whole assembly, brand new headlight like a brand new car"
Now THIS is how tutorial videos SHOULD be.  Great explanation on why you do the things you do without lessons on the history of sandpaper and what not.  Lol.  AWESOME video.
Using rubbing compound is a lot easier.
You forgot to polish it before coating.
Awesome video very informative.  I did try restoring my headlights came out great however it didn't last very long especially living in a Florida heat now back to its old form yellowish. I saw your other videos when flipping cars when restoring headlights you use ceramic coating rather than gloss spray. Which of these you highly suggest ceramic coating or glossy spray finish?
"Quick tip that I learned the hard way: If you've applied too much clear spray, use alcohol and microfiber towel to remove it. It will take time, and was a pain in my rear, but it will eventually get it off. Afterwards just restart the process all over again, beginning with 400 grit sand paper."
Mine were looking great then I went back in with the 2000 grit to try and remove the orange peel effect on one of them....now they're unclear again. Any thoughts? shall I start from the start? I've not tried to wax yet.
Your the best on YT sir!
"Make sure you wear a respirator (not mask), gloves and safety glasses when using the clear coat spray."
"Hey Chris, I did this same thing and the headlights look amazing! I have a question though, after the second or third coat, the clearcoat made this sort of wrinkle effect on the headlights, not quite the orange peel effect in this video, and sanding doesn't remove it. Any advice?"
Definitely gonna make some money in ma neighborhood
I f hought tbat the haziness was obn tbe insight surface
Thank you! How long is the whole process?
Does the clear coat work better than a plastic polish + UV resistant spray (sold separately)?
I normally like your videos but I was disappointed with the results after following these steps. It's improved my headlights but they're still hazy.
I would only cut back the orange peel on the paint if it was acrylic lacquer because if acrylic enamel clear coat paint is cut back that could dull the shine permanently !
"Meh, even the headlight you fixed was pretty blurry, improvement yes, but might as well grab another pair. Especially for that car, they are only like $80 for a pair lol."
Question is it a specific  type of rubbing alcohol  or any type can be used?
"Bullshit, 1 year protection tops."
Looks Great Chris
""
hey chris just wanna know about some of your products where to get them cause where i live they don't always carry the same products  like that wax & rustoleum spray  is there an alternative per say like the wax can i use any car wax ?
Outstanding thx.
I did a truck using this method but they were bad in the beginning I had to use 80grit
"Chris : Some headlights might be 200 $ 
Me : Checks local dealer : 500$ for a headlight, Nah fam il just polish and clear coat mine xD"
With clear coat worked perfect after we inspection they told me that I have to remove clear coat now sanded with 7000 the polished still small amount of scratches that still stay . It was like new but welcome to austria
"I wish all , ALL, YouTube videos were this well done!
I have watched many of your Excellent videos and I rebuilt my first three cars.
Extremely oxidized headlights and paint is easier to remove with a palm sander, less effort. 
Steel wool is used for RV windshields and is a substitute for wet sanding.
Just alternatives to your well done process."
I followed your directions but paint crazed.  Sanded off clear on one headlight and re-sprayed.   It crazed again.  The paint I used is the exact same stuff you mention in the video.   What gives?
Clear coat becomes as cracked lines and degraded after 3 month and it becomes very hard to sand and remove it. Without clear coat headlight also becomes yellowish after 3 month. So I am stack to make it last at least 1 year :S
"Thanks Chris!  I just did mine this morning (2003 Dodge Grand Caravan). Wow what a difference. I wet sanded using  400, 800, and 2000 grit buffing pads with an orbital sander and Meguiar's clear coat. Tomorrow I'll add wax."
"ChrisFix: This method won't require you to reapply wax
ChrisFix 10 minutes later: As the final step you must apply wax"
Thank you again chris! Was gonna have to get $1000 set of headlights because the ones on my e90 bmw were fogged to hell but after an hour or so of work I am more than satisfied.
Hey Chrisfix I did my fathers lights and they cleared up but there are these small cracks everywhere do you know why/ how to get rid of them
We had to sand aircraft windows with a sander then wet by hand then buffing before inspection. Took 4 hours per window
This is a good idea
"how about update?? , ill bet they are junk now"
"HELP___After completing the project with the correct sandpaper grits, cleaning with alcohol, and spraying with light coats of UV resistant clear coat, the headlights had several surface cracks( like a broken windshield). So I re-sanded with 220 grit and removed what I did. Completed the process again with the same results. What did I do wrong???"
nice
Headlight deoxidizers like Onestep are probably a better option at this point. Works in seconds and doesn't degrade the UV layer.
Is Motip Heat Resistant Clear Coat good for this job?
"Great video.  I used some ultra fine sand paper and then used Maguire's polish and spray (the spray seems to be something close to clear coat) and it worked well.  I'm just curious about one thing: just like in the video, the headlight became MUCH more transparent after applying the spray.  How is it able to do that?  I figured that any spray would reduce transparency.  Is it reducing reflection somehow?  If there are any lurking optics/physics folks, help me to understand this mystery."
"Unless you know what you are doing, PLEASE DO NOT DO IT.  This Clear will not stick to  Bare Plastic.   But it will stick temporarily. Permanently NO.  Most Aerosol Cans are not meant to be sprayed onto Bare Plastic.  For anything to adhere to Bare Plastic, you HAVE TO either have a Spray Can  that says, NO ADHESION PROMOTER REQUIRED.  Or you have to use an Adhesion promoter BEFORE YOU SPRAY THE CLEAR COAT. or before you spray any material onto Bare plastic.  To prove my point look at the SEM  Aerosol Spray Cans - Adhesion Promoter 39863,  SEM for Honda Bumpers 39293, NO ADHESION PROMOTER REQUIRED.  Without this Adhesion Promoter, any Coating you Spray can and will flake off in time.  I have been Painting Cars for 42 years now.  So I know.
Now, I do not work for The SEM Products company or anything, just that I have been using these SEM products for about 30+ years now.  These cans cost around $20+ a piece, and these are products used by most Auto Body Shops, and not sold at Home Depot's or Lowe's.
Also here you don't need to do a final sand with a 2000 Grit Sand Paper.  Grit 2000 is WAY TOO FINE for this job.   For an Aerosol Can job,  you can Safely Spray over 800 to 1000 grit Sanding Scratches.  Sanding with 2000 grit is mainly when you do a Color Sand and Buff job, or if you are going to be blending and fading out a specific blending job, and that is where you sand with 2000 Grit and then you use a blender to melt in the dry Clearcoat.  
Another thing to keep in mind is that, if you use 400, 600 and 2000 grit papers, make sure that the 600 grit WILL REMOVE ALL OF THE 400 SCRATCHES.  and that the 2000 WILL REMOVE ALL OF THE 600 GRIT SCRATCHES.  This is NOT SO EASY for someone who has never done Sanding and Painting.  In Body Shops we use a special Guide Coat that helps guide us with our Sanding and to remove all previous sanding scratches.  Look at the SEM Guide Coat Spray Can  38203 and 38253. 
Another thing to keep in mind is that whenever you do a Spray Can job, make sure you are doing this when it is nice an warm.  Never do this when its Cold and specially the surface you painting on is Cold.  For instance, keep the Headlight in a Warm Spot or facing the sun before you start painting.  Cold is never good when it comes to painting.  If the surface you are painting is stuck where there is no sunshine, then use a Heat Gun lightly or your wife's Hair Dryer.  And always remember to keep the surface a little to the warm side, around degrees 70F. 
If you can, wipe the surface you are going to be  painting with a Solvent Based Degreaser or Acetone BEFORE YOU START TO SPRAY ANYTHING.
One final Tip.  NEVER SPRAY TOO WET.  Meaning never spray your coats too wet.  Start your first coat almost like a very light dry coat, heat gun it for 20 seconds, then spray a second coat slightly wetter than the first then heat gun it for about 40 to 50 seconds, and keep going this way. You can spray your last coat the wettest, but be careful not to heat it up too much or your can and will boil the surface of the paint.  Use the heat gun or hair dryer from further away then.
Good luck."
I fixed my mom's old 2001 Rx 300 headlights with this. Thanks for the help!
"Chris, you are the man.  You've given me the confidence to try so many of these fixes that I never have before.  You're an amazing teacher and awesome film maker.  Thank you for all that you do."
This will crack the headlight clear coat isn't made for this use
"And how is this different from the 3M kit?  oh I see perhaps the 3M was inspired by this to make the Ultimate Kit, this was 8 yrs ago."
"My 2019 s 560 Mercedes headlights don't have oxidation but it appears to have over spray paint residue. Can I use this method and if so, what grit sand paper should I start and finish with. Thanks. New sub here."
3rd and final coat a bug flew in between the headlight and the spray and got stuck to headlight
Worked great. thanks
This will leave scratch
"Outstanding, thank you for the video."
"Hey ChrisFix, I've got microcracks on all over my headlights does this method fix that one too?"
"If the oxidation isn't too bad on my headlight, can I stick to the 600 & 2000?"
"As a painter, any kind of clear will yellow over time I've seen and use just about all kinds of clear it not bad product just it's normal"
when i did this the clear coat spider webbed. what am i doing wrong
"Can i also do this guide, if i want to remove spray paint from the headlights too?"
Don't do this.
"I did exactly this today with the same clear coat, it started crazing or cracking?? I had wiped with alcohol (Diggers Methylated spirits) before"
"I finally got around to doing both headlights on my 2002 Ford F-150.  The first headlight came out amazing.  However, while applying the second clear coat on the other headlight - it started to drizzle!  It wasn't supposed to, in the forecast,  and it only lasted a little while.  But I couldn't dap up the moisture as the clear coat was still wet.  Where the first headlight came out clear and absolutely smooth, this second headlight came out hazy and bumpy, presumably because of the raindrops.  Any suggestions as to how this can be fixed?  Do I have to strip off the clearcoat and start over?  <sigh>"
12; 10 You can see his face!!!
Just did it. Looks good. Thanks again for a helpful video.
2:58 chrisfix hits the griddy
"Rubbing compound and a buffer pad is the bast way to do this, Paint will peal. I used 3m compound from Amazon. My lights don't look brand new but they look pretty good, I did this last year and they still look good."
So what if I have to use my daily driver almost everyday
If the lights were bad enough and you finished the whole process can you restart and sand the spray paint off and go higher grit?
i had my headlights fixed when i got it inspected because apparently they have coverage for that but i watched this because i was curious and the texture from the clear coat looks just like my headlights do so i think they used the same method
thank you so much! we have several cars with hazy lights. I'm going to do this to all of them!
"Sadly this doesn't work in Texas.  Too much UV.  I tried this on 2 cars and about a year later the clear coat was coming off and it was even harder to get them back to the original clearness again.  I don't know the best way, but I agree the headlight needs some coating.  I'll try the Cerakote kit next.  I still love the 3M kit but it does need some coating on after."
Nice...i will give a try.
All you really need to do is use WD-40 and 30 seconds later it's done and it looks great and you may have to do it twice a year and you'll be really surprised on the results
I did this years ago I remember wetting the light first is key just like wetting cement first is key. Thanks Chris
"Doubt I'll get a response from anyone since this video is old but, does this prevent them from yellowing as well?"
When I do this what should the Temperature be to get the best results ?
"Hi Chris, I just finished doing my headlights. It all worked great but there are a few running paint spots from the spray. It's still fresh, so I don't know how it looks tomorrow after it's dry. But if they're still there, can I sand them down without having to do this over? Any feedback is greatly appreciated :)"
"Hi Chris, I love your work.I tried the exact steps but the clear coat upclose has cracks,light coats were given as recommended.Saw many other youtubers having the same problem with the clear coat"
"Not permanent, but last longer than kits, maybe a couple years. If I applied wax maybe it would have lasted much longer?"
"I use autosole metal polish with a soft drill attachment.  Quick polish up after with screen wash on a clean towel,  then clear coat. 20 min job and comes out really nice. Just a lil elbow grease is tighter corners ."
Seems like this would make sense on a brand new car too. Go straight to the taping and clear coat before you ever need to do any sanding.
12:15. Beautiful
11:07.thst looks awesome
How often do I have to reapply gloss spray?  Thxs
Well done I like it I do my car tomorrow
"So it's no different from all the other methods, except for doing the clear coat paint. 
Meguiar's PlastX with a powered buffer is the best."
"The problem with this method is the paint and orange peel.   The other issue is that the sun will damage the paint and result in cracked paint and haziness over time.  Mercedes used to paint its headlight covers and they looked awful after a couple of years.  I would do a sanding process until the runoff shows no brown tint and then buff the surface with a rubbing compound, then a polishing compound.  Protection long term is achieved by a coating of a clear special UV light protectant which is available at the auto parts stores."
Thanks.for the video Chris. You are awesome. Why does everybody say that the clear coat goes bad after a year and then its impossible to remove? Is that your experience?
I fucked it up
I hate to say it but you are wrong. It is not permanent. It will revert back to the same old problem given enough time. I have not found a magic cure yet.
thanks I can see at night again!
What of you do a dry sand?
What did you use to buff it out on the end?
Buff it too ;)
"I used to work at a body shop when I was a teenager during the summer   . We always used rubbing compound on the head light covers then buffed them and it worked but I don't know how long they would stay clear because he would sell 30-50 trucks each week. The owner only bought, fixed and sold trucks from a water company and most were totaled or needed new fenders bumpers and we only painted them black he wouldn't use any other color lol. He would buy a few S-10'a but mostly Mazda and Ford Rangers since the parts were interchangeable. 32 years later and I still cough and spit up old paint lol ""I am joking but sanding so many trucks in a closed garage with no ventilation did mess my lungs up bad and I am still paying for it""."
I need to try this
Does this work for glass headlights
Thaks Chris the metod you used worked for me as well hopefully I'll pass my MOT
never do it with 400-600 paper.... First with 800 and then 1.400 and last time 3000 and 6000.
i used WD40 very easy
Does this method work with scratches?
looking good did this and it lasted me 3 years before it pealed the clear coat and thats with 2k clear
Does it matter which type of car wax you use?
Oh heck yeah!  Bought the kit from Oreillys and it was worthless!
"Warning: don't use 2000 grit after waiting a day for the 3rd layer of clear coat to dry. I did that before waxing, and I wish I would have just left the orange peel from the clear coat. It looks like crap now."
Any help?! Ive done this to a T and 24 hours later the clear coat is peeling in many sections and looks like shit... please advise the remedy
Can you do a lifter repair video on a v8?
"Cool temporary solution, doesn't work overtime. After 1 year the clear coat starts to crack :("
This worked like a charm. I wish it was $10 a headlight.  This fix was way way cheaper than getting new headlights
Baking soda and lemons work
"""You want to get in the groove right here."" Sure do, sure do -)"
that looks like spacy headligts on the bottom left..
Wow cool video. Very smart
I tried it n still has haze n didnt work
Sandpaper! Good Grief!
"I use WD40 and a paper towel to keep my headlights clear. It isn't permanent, but it costs next to nothing to do, takes maybe 1 minute of your time once a month, and the WD40 AND one roll of paper towels will last for at least a few years and in terms of time will cost you maybe 12 minutes a year. If you're both cheap and lazy, this is the way to go."
"Awesome vid, thank you!!"
"Does it scratch the headlights when using sand papers?
Just curious"
Thanks Chris! I used this video to clear up my headlights and they came out looking phenomenal.
"We also struggle to get hold of 2000 sandpaper in the UK now. The hardware store I went to said they can't get hold of it, the finest they had was 1200."
"I tried this, & made the mistake of using Halford Universal clear gloss lacquer (has a pic of a headlight on the front of the can) & as soon as I sprayed it on, across in sweeps as done on this video, it started running. It's better than it was, I can at least see where I am going in the dark now lol but it looks shocking."
"When you Clear Coat, DO NOT bread the spray. It will coat your lungs!"
"i called rustoleum and asked them and they said none of their products is for headlights. i have R-O acrylic enamel, gloss clear. Automotive grade, bonds to plastic, metal and more. Does not say nonyellowing"
"please help: wet-sand-paper 320-400-600-800-1000-1500-2000 by hand with swirling motion. with each next sanding, go less and less milky residue. they appear opaque now. do i need to go higher grade? 3000, 3500? do i need to buff, can i get away with no buffing? what paste is used for buffing. then i plan to crystal clear coat them. can i skip the buffing?"
"Link for wax is dead.
When do we use the (Compound polish to remove the orange peel, is that after the 3rd Clear coat dries the 24 hrs. 
Why didn't you do this step?
Why the link to the very overpriced 91% alcohol at almost $19.00 for 2 16oz bottles you do know you can get that at Walmart for only $2.00 per 16 OZ bottle @ 91% alcohol that's a difference of $15.00."
Looks like the same film they are putting on eye glasses now.  Wish that would have never started as it's impossible to get rid of it on eye glasses.  Guess i could try this on an older pair and see if this works.
"Thanks. I needed that.  I always thought that hazing was on the inside.  And, to use sandpaper on clear plastic? I never thought that would work.  I learned something new today.  Thanks. K"
Lol my headlights are $700 each to replace
"With some wind gusts and possibly too close to the headlamp cover, there are some leaks flowing down.  What is the best way to fix this?"
"This isn't permanent. The paint will last for about 4-5 years of daily sun exposure, before it breaks down and you'll have to redo it. 3M film will do the same, with similar longevity, but can easily be removed and re-applied."
"Hey Chris. I've been doing your 10-minute system using mag and Aluminum polish and then finish off with Meguiar's headlight coating. Same results with less work. 
My question is, if i do the same thing but use the clear spray that you used will i get the same results and longevity. 
Now i have to redo about every 2 years.
Love your instructional videos. Keep them coming"
How many coats can I do in one day?
cooooooool
"Sorry but this is not how you do headlights. Those headlights are not clear, they're still hazed. I can make them look brand new. I have several of my restorations on my FB page, I also detail vehicles for a living. I use four grit strengths and never use 400 and rarely 600. I use a 3-inch hook n loop 800/1500/3000/5000 Sonax Ultimate Cut to buff out then Perfect finish as my polish then I clear coat them. Oh, and with my Ultimate cut, I use a wool pad with rotary, foam for Polish."
"He didn't mention it, but that last coat is a bit heavier. Its a fine line between not enough and too much and it runs.

But to get less orange peel, make that last coat heavier.

Also, when wet sanding, be careful of any sharp edges in the shape of the plastic. The sides, and on some cars there might be a ridge in the middle, etc. Its all too easy to burn through all the paint with the sandpaper on any sharp edges. So go very easy on any edges."
"Don't forget to wash first!

Headlight must be clean before you start sanding."
does this work on all cars? i assume it does
"Great job,  easy to follow instructions.  Thanks!"
"Hey chris if its a new set of headlights, never touched before, does it still need to be sanded to put on clearcoat?"
THATS CHRIS I WILL BE DOING THIS TO BOTH OUR CARS. MY HUSBAND WILL NEVER DO IT. I'M NOT SCARED.
"Hi Chris. I just performed this on my 2012 Highlander and for some reason, the paint produced a veiny, spiderweb type of appearance. I read where you described to sand again with 1000 and 2000 grit, then compound and polish. But after sanding that much, shouldn't I put one more clear coat on? Thanks."
"8 years later just did it on my 1995 mitsubishi 3000gt headlights... They look better than before, to say the least. But my clearcoat got all scaly and veiny, which is likely just because I live in Texas and humidity doesnt like paint.. Not much to do about that, but looks better than it did. Going to go over it with some steel wool and high grit to try and smoothen it out once its fully dry :)"
"@chrisfix Chris - your link to the carnauba wax you used is broken....with a lil pause/play I was able to see that you used Collinite brand....can you please add your recommendation(s) for brand of carnauba car wax?

I searched thru the comment thread to see if you've already done this but didn't find anything....of course, I could have missed it!

Anyway, the Collinite price point is higher than others like Mothers or Meguiars....but I don't want to sacrifice quality. Can you elaborate on which carnauba wax to use? Thanks!!!"
"I did this but after the final sanding, I used a cutting compound to polish the lens before clear coat. 
It makes a huge difference! Wish I could share pictures here to show my results."
$20 may have been the cost for materials back in 2014 when this was made but not today. But works so you may still want to try it.
"I followed this method to the absolute best of my ability...used the right grit strengths, used the spray bottle, used the exact same bottle of clearcoat and sprayed it conservatively as shown...but I just ended up with an even worse looking, completely scratched up headlight covered in runny clearcoat. I tried to sand it down again and redo it but ended up damaging the headlight even more. Pleased be advised, this job is probably better left to the professionals. Or, just buy one of those cheap restoration kits from autozone."
"step 0 mask off the headlight area with masking tape.
step 1 spray headlight with water
step 2 sand with 400grit circularly then horizontally (keep wet)
step 3 sand 600grit circularly, then horizontal (keep wet)
step 4 spray it with water, then wipe it down.
step 5 sand with 2000grit circularly then horizontally (keep wet)
step 6 dry off lens, wipe clean with alcohol using lowlint microfiber
step 7 mask off hood with trashbag , cut out lens area
step 8 spray thin coats of clearcoat. do 3 coats minimum
let it set, full dry in 24 hours. 
step 9 for flawless: wetsand with 2000grit then with microfiber towel add car wax then buff it off."
"An even simpler trick which is practically free (but not as durable as what Chris describes).

Get a rag, smear some toothpaste on it, and rub rub rub.  Most toothpaste has a very fine abrasive in it ... I've used this to repair a scratched music CD (of blessed memory)."
Wow. Nice
Followed your instructions and worked almost OK but I got some clear paint lines like blood vaines ... not sure why except that I did 60 grit dry sanding as a test before I tried anything. Canot attach an image which I thought I could.
"Mine started cracking after the first coating. And I tried 3, 4 times, and it always has some cracking of the clear coat."
Will heat cure the clear coat faster? And will I be able to drive my car while the coat is curing if it is rainy/snowy?
Hey Chris I'm having a problem every time I do the first spray it tends to do some cracks
"did this like my sophmore year of highschool, and just redid it as what would be my sophmore of college. i don't know if i did it wrong the first time cause it yellowed, but this sure as hell beats buying another set of headlights. they look amazing!"
"I understand it's just a PT cruiser, but you should buff the plastic with a polishing compound after 2000 grit. Drastically improves the clarity"
This worked great for us! We just did my sisters and my car and they look fantastic! Many years later and this video is still helping people thank you!
"Chris hoping you can answer this, if you out it on too thick with the clear coat and it starts to looked cracked which I'm assuming is orange peel, what do I do...?"
Can't get rid of the orange peel... :(
"I did this and one of my headlights ended up hazy while the other came out crystal clear (ignoring orange peel). Is it possible I put too thick of a first coat on, or perhaps missed something when sanding, or is it more likely that it's somehow dirty inside? 2008 Accord, headlight enclosures are sealed pretty well and neither shows evidence of moisture inside.
Still haven't polished them- will be doing so shortly- but I don't expect it to help the hazier one. If it is something between the sanding and clearcoat, would hitting it with a lower grit to strip the coating and try again be a smart idea? (I probably won't do that, but I'd like to know)

In any case, the other headlight (which I think looked worse before) is _impressively_ clear now, and even the bad one is much better than before. I did use a few extra grits, and I don't think what I used was technically clearcoat (UV resistant 1K gloss enamel?), but wow, it's incredible the difference it made. Looks way less trashy now."
Just replaced our '08 CRV headlights with new ones from eBay. We also upgraded to super bright LED bulbs. After installation at a shop the total cost was around $300.
"Chris, I walked through the steps provided in this video yesterday and now have clear headlights.  Thank you so much for saving me money."
"Awesome  !!
Thanks  Chris."
I watch a professional headlight restoration YouTube channel he says do not use any product that dose not say for headlights only
I drive a 2014 Honda Civic sedan in a rotation with a 2018 Subaru Crosstrek. I cleaned both headlight vehicles for the first time ever on both vehicles. Great results!
"Hey Chris, just finished restoring my 2008 Ford Focus headlight. The result came out to be amazing. Thanks for the tips and clear instructions. I have learnt a lot from your videos."
"You can't restore headlamps ""permanently.""  You may as well claim you can restore your tyres, by sanding some rubber off."
"This method still requires a clearcoat. Permanent? If the stated reasons for yellowing is that the original clearcoat is getting chipped, this will probably still happen to any clearcoat. The polishing version I found that lasts years is the acetone wipe one.  After masking around the headlight,  use fine sandpaper to smooth the plastic as much as possible. Then a single wipe with a soft cotton rag saturated in acetone melts the surface plastic and turns the plastic clear. No clearcoat needs to be applied. So far it has lasted three years on my 20 year old Camry."
"Hey Chris.. a question if you please
can i use the chloroform vapor after the 2000 sanding then after few hours wipe with alcohol and proceed lastly using the 2X ultra cover spray followed by the polish"
Did this and it looks like shit. After 600 grit it just left a white film on the headlight
Dude finally we got to see your face from a reflection
Absolute worst thing to do clear leaves a shit ton of micro cracks looks terrible
Nothing is permanent. Hello darkness my old friend. I've come to see you once again. Just kidding.. great job
What wax is that at the end where can I get it?
"With your method of way, do you reapply the wax every 6-12 months for permanent?  Ever try the 3M wipe on clear coat or Rust-Oleum ""Protective Enamel Gloss Crystal Clear""; ""Gloss Clear Lacquer Spray Paint""; ""Gloss Clear Enamel Spray Paint"" vs Rust-Oleum 2x?"
"I did it a few months ago, so far so good, in my experience they would have started to fog up already using other methods"
You are truly the best! I am a single 60 year old female who has never had enough money for repairs of any kind or anyone to ever help me. I have cried so many times about troubles that have happened with my vehicles thinking now what? I can't do that as in different repairs ...but then each time I found you except one issue recently. You  have always had such clear verbally and visually videos. You have saved me so much money! And you gave me a pride or great feeling when I was done saying ... Wow I did it myself! The one thing I did not find from you that I needed help with was for a 2005 Buick rainier specifically how to get the washer fluid reservoir out and check to see where fluid is pouring out from. In my case it was a crack in the base of the rear fluid pump. Car shop said they checked it out and there was a huge hole or maybe they said crack and wanted est. Of $400!! There was neither! My lights tho had some kind of vinyl cover over them that was peeling off and then once I just pulled all the film off .... my headlights were ruined and I could not see clearly out of them and nothing ever worked that I tried but I kept making them worse. So thank you so much again!!
I took mine to Sam's club just this morning for under 35 total..they did an amazing job too...good as new!!
"I encourage you all to compare the energy in the ""hey guys"" from this 7 year old video to all the recent ones. That is all."
Can I use 0000 steel wool?
It looks like it needs to be polished
Rubish
"I did this, lightly sanded down the orange peel, and my end result is very blurry, did I not sand down enough with the 400? or did I not spray the coating on evenly enough? the tops of my headlights are slightly flat and those came out w the most clarity, I have 2015 Nissan Altima"
I USED NAIL POLISH REMOVER AND ALL KINDS OF YELLOW CAME ONTO PAPER TOWEL . THEN WASHED AND NO SAND PAPER REQUIRED . THEN CLEAR COAT UV AND NON YELLOWING AND BOY BEAUTY .
"If I have brand new headlights, can I skip all the wet sand part and straight use the spray?"
"My hands grow from random places, but I tried to do what Chris showed. And it did work for sure. Not ideally, the lights can't be compared with a new set, but they definitely look way, way better than they used to be. The one thing that didn't work well is the Gloss Clear coverage which somehow got tiny cracks in many places. They are barely visible from a distance, but they are there. In any case, I got some fun doing that and I'm satisfied with the result. Especially thinking that just one head light costs $150-170. Great savings!"
Thanks I'm happy with the results
He sounds Italian a little ?
@ChrisFix please help. I use a spray witch turn yellow after 6 mounths. Now i need to get off the yellow and apply new one. Witch sand paper to use to get rid of the yellow part? Thanks
"This is basically how you sharpen a knife, just different angles and no chemicals."
"Chris! Help! I put on matte instead of glossy as the base layer. Will it work if I put on glossy now, wet sand, and buff with wax?"
Mr fix you're amazing
"I know it's many years late, but toothpaste isn't really completely out of the question for polishing, it's literally a polishing compound, toothpaste has a grit to it."
Cleaned my lights and sprayed the clear and it started cracking? Is it possible to be too close? Maybe I went too thick? I used this same clear
toothpaste works the same and its onely a $1. I just did it and got the same results as you:)
"After I sanded it with the 400 grit, 600 grit, 2000 grit, cleaned it, and then applied the clear coat (and let it cure for 24 hours - it looked great at this point). I then attempted your alternative to sand down the clear coat orange peel with 3000 grit (wet sand) it it's back to looking super hazy like at first with the earlier sanding. Did you mean, if you want to sand the orange peel, you need to do 3k grit, 5k grit, and then polish in order to get it to be crystal clear?"
I had to redue my headlights 3 times because my paint kept cracking.. humidity and temp was fine and headlights were clean before application. I did 5 minutes then 10 between until finally I just waited and did one coat a day which is what made it come clear. Still came out basically new but took more time. Not sure why I used the same paint as well
Does this work after 7 years?
"Awesome job,young man.Thx"
Chris... i followed the instructions and got a little to happy with the clear coat and now its drippin lmao. To redo the process i jist got to get 200 grit and start from the beginning huh?
Would this work on motorcycle windshield? It's plexiglass and has a lot of scratches.
"If you accidentally put a thick coat and it ran, could I redo the whole thing in a few days???"
I tried this on my 2007 honda accord and the headlights look way better.
Finally the PT Cruiser got some love lol
"vw polo 1998 never had to do this , bought honda fit 2009 , 2 months ago and i need this help , thanks for the video"
Hey Chris how long do i sand the lens with each sand paper
Just make headlights out of glass for god sakes
"Your spraying from too far making a pebbled finish, the closer the smoother the finish since the paint doesnt have time to dry as it travels the distance to hit surface, there's a sweet spot, I know on the instructions the say 10"" -12 "" distance thats way too far you will never get smooth finish that way."
"A new headlight for my '06 Audi TT costs OVER $1000 from the dealer! And you can't separate the lense, so you would have to buy the whole thing! :) great vid, TY"
You should be able to use same bag on the other side light by flipping the garbage bag over
I like to use a bit of polish after sanding as it has a very fine grit that helps to further remove any extra imperfections
Another great job Chris.  I got a quote here in Australia to restore my honda integra dc5 Headlights..A$550....what a ripoff . Thanks for the video . Keep up the great job mate. Cheers
How long did it take you to do that for one headlight
This shit is like ASMR for pro car detailers and enthusiasts.
"About how long should you do each sanding process? I did the 400 for about 20 minutes and have been steadily going at it with the 600 for the last hour or so. I still get the milky stuff, so I'm not sure if I need to keep going with the 600 grit. I have a 2004 Infiniti G35 and the headlights are a little big, so I figured it would take extra time to do them!  Thank you so much for your helpful videos!"
"Some links don't work anymore, like wax.."
What was that alcohol?
"31,500,000. VIEWS!!!!"
"I did it, and lights looks great!  Maybe more elbow greese than I expected, but they were some dingy headlights, so it took some effort.  But they look awesome now!"
"Keep saying it looks 'amazing'. It only improved by 20%. You also need to know any restoration level, depends in how much blemishing there is. Worse damage than shown here, will NOT look as good as these results."
Video could have been more simplified and shorter w/o describing what we all see.
And how about the haziness to the inside? That plays a big factor from the constant heat and brightness.
"I followed ur steps for Permanent Headlight Restoration(mostly), but had a little clear coat that sagged a tiny bit. How can that be fixed? Haven't applied wax yet. Follower since 2008."
i live in the uk and cant find that clear gloss anywhere. Not on amazon either. What is a good alternative please as most of them don't say about plastic use
Hey Chris what do I do if one headlight came out better than the other?
Can we do process again ..if you messed up with spraying too much leaving double layers
"Can't find isopropyl alcohol anywhere, can I use brake cleaner or something?"
Just wanted to say thank you for this video. My sister has a 1996 Monte Carlo that I worked on the lights today. Turned out awesome.
A great recommendation for most things... is to really get in the groove
lol
I got all the stuff and trying this today
What to do if I used too much of the clear coat?
Chris your a badass bro!
"You: ""Looks awesome!""
Me: ""Looks crap..."""
"""if your headlights are easily removeable i would remove them"" the mf who wired my headlights directly instead of sodering the connector laughing in the background"
"Dude, you are amazing. I am so gonna try this, on my car. I bought headlight cleaning kit, $34 X 2 , one for each headlight. And one turned out okay, the other still shit. Thank you for this well done, step by step, thorough and clear to understand video. I can't wait to see some of your other videos."
My dad says it's better to do the spray paint and let it dry when it's warm outside because the paint sticks better.
"Just done this to a older car that I seriously thought I was gonna have to buy new headlight assembly and decided to try this, after doing this it literally looks like I put new headlight assemblies in, what a difference this made, great video and thanks for sharing"
dont tell Chris how much head lights are worth in 2022
I used his method.  And the result was amazing!!!  I completed both headlights less than 2hrs.
I just made my headlights more milky...lol
Would be an interesting video if you mention headlight restore kits and see which ones work from which don't
$250 per? Keep walking Acura. $800 per on 08 tl type s.
"Wow!! just doing this on my twenty year old Jeep, and the results are so much better than I had hoped for!!"
Chrisfix is my DAD!
Buff and polish
"Seven years since this was first posted.
This is awesome. Wow!"
"I just finished spraying the headlights (my first time doing this) and I have some tips. First if you don't have a spray bottle, take a empty soda bottle, poke some holes in the cap carefully (from underneath is easier), and squeezing it lets water out (my mom's tip).

 Next when you are putting on the painters tape, make a large overlap between each piece of tape helps because if the end of the tape lifts slightly from being wet, car is still protected.  

Third is when you are spraying do it outside. The fumes are strong and not good to breathe. Also wear a face mask if possible and hold your breath while spraying. Walk away from the area when done spraying until the fumes clear. I forgot to hold my breath for some reason and the smell is now stuck in my nose. Time t take a warm shower and clear my nose! Or just nose spray saline solution. 

I was scares to spray too much. It's my first time using spray paint. So I got a run which is a drip line where I sprayed too much paint. I think to avoid spraying too much paint, keep the can far enough from the headlight while spraying and don't move your hand too slowly. Please let me know if that is true, paint professionals.

 I imagine you can practice spraying on a plastic surface like a food container. It'll give you an idea of how spray paint works and what mistakes cause runs, which you might not care about if you don't want your headlight to look 100% perfect. But it might make you more  confident in  spray paints.

It took me prob 3 hours since my headlight were bad and I work slow. But maybe you'll be faster!"
I'm constantly getting a thick haze in the head light after the 2000 grit.. even when I wipe with alcohol... it just returns to the thick haze.. Should I use a courser grit ... I only used 600 and 2000.
Thank you so much
Rattle can clear yellows and hazes over time. It also chips off from rocks and debris...this is a terrible idea.
"How many minutes between applying of each coating?
Brandon"
"I did exactly as you say in the video, one of the light looks really good ! But the other one has some thick crack probably from the clear coat... I wet sand it with a 2000 one and it still has the cracks... Should I start again or what should I do? Thanks for the video your content is awesome !"
"Fantastic, but eventually the 1k clear coat peels off after about 12 to 16 months.  I am going to try the 2k clear coat."
"great video! I sprayed it 3 times with the clear coat and it still shows that ""orange peal"" effect slightly, so should I light sand with 3000 to take some of that out or should I try to put another coat on it? but overall the lights are 98% better, no kidding! now I need to do this on my old Silverado which has headlights like yellow snow!"
Chris you're The MAN!!! Thank you soO much!!!
I that he will increase the finess of sand paper...
Really well done. Comprehensive. Perfect.
Off spray pads works perfect
"Literally spent two hours sanding and wasn't getting any clarity, then I realized my sandpaper was topped at 1000 grit. Make sure you don't make the same mistake.
Update: I think my real problem was that I sanded too hard on the lower grit. Sanding more lightly doesnt seem to change anything. Am I screwed?"
"I hear more and more from people that the varnish darkens in short time, how your headlights look after a long time?"
Where can I get that specific gloss ?
Did this today just as you instructed and it worked 100%! Thank you for the step by step video.
you shouldn't apply wax to clear coat for a while after the paint job. i think you're supposed to wait 2 weeks. paint is still breathing after it has dried.
brilliant
Did this to my '99 truck with yellowed lenses. Worked excellent! Now doing my wife's '17 Subaru!
Can I leave the clear coat over night then wax next morning
It worked perfect for my Buick
As always....awesome  vid Chris!!
use mequiar's Headlight clear coat it works great for me
"I tried this on my grandpa's car, he is now happy and proud of me. Thank you Chris!"
Wudder lol. Great vid
What does it look like today?
This spray not working for all headlights ...
What if I cant wait 24 hrs
Im wondering if you can still drive the car while it clarifying within the 24 hours. Also plastic is peeling off one of the headlights and under the peeling plastic the headlight looks fine. I wonder how I would remove the plastic and restore that headlight.
Will 1500 grit work just as good as 2000 grit at the end?.
"I just did my 2010 CRV and 2000 Explorer using this process. Works great and is easy to do. Beats the expensive Sylvania, Mothers and other kit methods out there today. Thanks Chris!"
"heya, I used this method and worked so good , but I messed up a bit one headlight and got a running line on it , can I send it out with 1000 and 2000 a bit and use one more layer of clear coat?"
Hy. What if only upper half of headlight is foged up? Should I sandpaper whole headlight or just part that is foged up? Thanks
"Sorry I'm late...This video is 7yr old, and  I just liked it! Thank you!"
Sadly a lot of headlights fog over from inside not outside.
Very helpful! Thanks Chris
Can i do the process from inside the headlight ( i separated the head from the housing) so can i sand it from the inside !
"Hey @ChrisFix so I did everything like the video.  I cleaned sanded cleaned up.  I used compound, then polish clean head light one last time with Alcohool.  And then hit it with clear coat.  And immediately the clear started cracking as it dried.  Everywhere.  Where did I go wrong?"
"""Ive seen headlights 250$ each"" 


lol that aint nothing."
"Hello ChrisFix!

This channel of yours is great! I love your advices!!! 

I have tested out this way of doing it and it worked out pretty well!

I was having this idea of doing this some time ago but only 2 days ago i was able to do it, have done it and it became awesome!

Tomorrow morning i Will do the second headlight and i Will film it too as i'am a poor youtuber yet! :p

I Will make some publicity to your channel too! :p

Lots of hugs from Portugal friend!"

Can you take the over spray cover off when you finish the last coat or do you have to wait until the next day to take it off?
"I have a coat clear that is matte, can I use that or do I need to buy a gloss one?"
"Excellent video Chris.
Followed your video instructions and had excellent results.
I had poor results with the clear coat product used in the video. Had to sand down the clear coat and redo with a pro quality clear coat from an auto body supply. Second time worked amazingly well.
Thanks Chris."
Rustoleum 2k clear gloss is no longer available. The Spray Max 2k clear seems to be the weapon of choice for this battle. It's about $25/can from Amazon.
"I used t-cut on mine - took ages , but got me through the MOT after the garage owner said it was impossible to fix them :)
MOT is due again now :)"
HEY GUYSSSS
"I used the same clear coat but the result was not the same, it looked like snake skin (there were cracks all over the head light, not smooth like before). Do you know why?"
"Pls Chris, my car steering turns to the left more than to the right. What's the cause and the solution. Thanks
Is Corolla sport 2006"
"Wish I could post the pic of how mine turned out. Thank you!!! Followed every step and same materials, all good looking great."
I don't know what happened but I think I kind of messed up. I EVEN SPRAYED THE GLOSS AND DIDN'T LOOK AS GOOD AS YOURS. SHOULD I START OVER?
I fucking inhaled all that shit in. Felt like a king
mine came out kind of like foggy even after the clear coat? should i just wet sand then wax??
what happens if the gloss clear runs a little how could i fix it?
"I originally found a video years ago of someone doing this to their car. Having watched your other videos, I was glad to find your video. I didn't have the four or six hundred grit, just some of the fiber ones, but it came out wonderful. Thanks so much"
If you add a little dish soap to the water when wet sanding will make it even better.
I tried Armor wipes it's still shiny today. I used it about 2-3 months ago.
Thank you for sharing your remedy! Worked good for my 97 ranger
Are you Nederlands?
"10 dollars, how about all the work you being doing"
"Hey man followed these steps bout a year ago headlights started peeling. Is this normal? Thanks again, I learn alot from your vids"
"I tried this process. It didn't get as clear. Any tips? I sand it, use same spray, not clear. It looks about the same as I started as far as clarity goes. TIA!"
Clear coat came out super thick wasn't expecting it and it starting dripping right away
are your headlights still good?
The clear coat came out runny. Any tips on how to fix it?
use oven cleaner faster and easier the clean with alcohol and paint ...got no respect for guys who point out the most time consuming expensive fricking way to do everything 1 hour and done that is the way to roll
"For some reason one headlight worked well, the other one veins and lines all over, can I remove them from doing everything from the beginning?"
I used the same tools as you and my headlights have this crack like pattern that appeared i wanted to know if that was normal or do i have to sand it witha finer grit or something
"Followed this method and still came out cloudy. Headlights did have deep seeded sun damage and cracks. I thought it was all sanded evenly, clear coat even, even used a light 3500 grit sand to remove orange peel.. any feedback would greatly appreciated"
I used toothpaste 5 years ago and still looks good
"if this cost 10 bucks per light, 3M's kit can be had for$16.00"
"Chris the money saving guru Cheers bro! Repaired my VW Crafter lights now they look like new, without the $200 bill for a new light
If you repair headlights on any Chinese made cars you increase the value by $1"
Gonna spray my headlights with wutter
"Edit: Perfectionist in me talking; all personal opinion/preference.

While I don't entirely agree with the sanding portion of this(personal opinion and preference! I would have started with a much higher grit; 1000 or 1200 to remove as little as possible and progressively go up in grit until I hit 3000; 1000/1200, 1600, 2000, 3000) you ultimately end up with results good enough to protect your headlights so I won't fault Chris' method 

The only thing I would add is to apply more layers of clear coat so if you do have to do this again in the future, you'll only have to sand down a bit of the clear coat as opposed to more of the headlight plastics risking creating a lens from uneven sanding and/or buffing in the actual plastic.(Remember, buffing is an abrasive process, people tend to focus their attention to more hazy spots to buff it out which creates low spots on the headlight's surface creating a lens)

When buffing, always buff the entire surface evenly until the entire surface meets your requirements. Do not focus on any one spot.(Low spots created by uneven buffing can be seen in a car's finish when you see a lensing/fisheye effect in the gloss finish but there isn't a noticeable low spot by feel or dent in the finish )"
This was the first video I look at on your channel but you help me a lot chis
"I tried these and my 2000 RX300 headlights now looks new, I just hope the cleat coat will last. Just follow as is."
You know that a video is good when you watch it with no sounds and still learn everything
I did all the steps right but one of my headlights came out cracked all over what should I do?
"i had orange peel after all the steps so 3000 grit sanded and applied wax but tbh it looked better using 3000 grit, now it has slight scratches i can see through the wax?"
Very well demonstrated.  Thank you.
Up to $250? Have you seen Volvo headlights? One assembly for my V70R was around $1000
Do you have to leave it for 1 day to dry
thank you Chris. followed the steps. headlight on my old sedan have a shine and look better
does it HAVE to be 600 grit
"Several things you should never, ever do. First, and most importantly, never apply any coating, sealant or film to a polycarbonate lens. That's the single worst thing you can do to a lens. Manufacturers don't do it, neither should you.
Second, sanding is a last resort step. The harder you sand, the more you dull out the lens and the harder it is to bring it back to clear. Don't do that.
Third, those kits are not useful. They don't give you the necessary tools to succeed. Don't waste money, time and effort with them. 
My advise: spend $100 and hire a headlight expert to do it right, the first time. Don't go to a car wash, or ""detailer"", or any other non expert. Get a headlight specialist. Make sure he/she doesn't apply any coatings of any kind after he/she is done.
Lastly, ignore this video. It's useless. 
Be well!"
"Hello, what if I leave it only with clear coat on. Without the car wax?
Do I 100% need it to wax the headlights after clear coating them?"
"Once you finish the 3 clear coats, can you drive the vehicle while you are waiting the 24 hour period?"
"I followed these directions about 6 years ago, and the lights still look great! I also did the fog lights! Thanks, Chris!"
"Damn I am SO glad that out of my 7 vehicles, only ONE of them doesn't have real glass headlights! I hate these abominable cheap plastic things. Alas, I have that ONE car that has them, and, at 20 years old, they look like crap."
Thanks bro
"i did on mine with 600, 800, 1000, 1500 that is it! and clear coat after look as good as new :)"
Wooter
I love you ChrisFix
Nice job
"Mine weren't quite as oxidized and I just went to town with a plastic polishing compound and a drill. Seemed to do the trick too, but the deeper scratches remain."
Do not buy this  spray your  head lights will get foggy and you could check amazon to see how many others got they headlight ruin
"Well, I'll be dipped in do-do. This actually works! I just came in from doing my 2009 Honda CRV as per your instructions. Haven't waited the 24 hours yet or applied the wax, but I will. It already looks 95 percent better. Not totally like new, but I am one happy guy. But a tsk-tsk to you for making the garbage bag installation look so easy. Was the worst part for me. But never mind. Where do I send the check?"
WOW!
Can I use 800 grit instead of 600?
I did my 2015 van and it came out Great! Thanks for the Video!
Have you tried the vapor cleaning system?
"I actually did this to my car, since my headlights were very yellow, but finished with a plastic polish. I didn't think of a clear coat, so thanks for this video, great."
can u use this for tail lights also ?
THIS IS NOT A PERMANENT SOLUTION TO DE PROBLEM! CLEAR COAT PAINT WASNT MADE FOR THIS PURPOSE! YOU MISLEAD YOUR VIWERS!
"FANTASTIC!!! I thought I would have to replace my headlights in my Escape, which would have ran me $120 for the set, but for $20 @ Ace Hardware, I saved myself $100. Thanks!!!"
Looks and car value is not primarily why you do this. _The most important reason is SAFETY._
"Hello Chris,

Is it okay to use clear top coat?"
Where do you get the GLOSS CLEAR!!
this doesn't last any longer than new headlights. sanding and redoing headlights isn't exactly a new idea
Would we putrainx or clay at the end?
I wish people put this much effort into cleaning their teeth with it....38 year dental hygienist
Cant click on the description with links.  God youtube is so fucking useless.
"I used this method, but didn't use clear coat to finish, using UV wipes from a headlights restore kit instead. Before going in with water, sand and alcohol I used the cleaning wipes also from the kit. 
As an experiment, I just used the kit without sanding on one headlight, the other kit and sanding. The non sanded headlight held up for 2 years before starting to fog again, while the sand + kit headlight is still going strong. So if you don't want to commit to the clear coat, I'd say using the wipes in conjunction with the above sanding and cleaning method is a good alternative."
So if you put a little too much spray paint it will run. And how to fix that?
Do I add anything to the towel when buffing?
"Chris, thanks for putting this together, it's great information. Hopefully you can help me figure out what I'm doing wrong. I tried it a few times and have consistently come up with a crazed finish. It looks like very fine spider webs throughout the headlight. I did the 400,600 and 2000 wet sand with lots of rinsing and an IPA prep and dry prior to paint ( I had headlights off the car).  Shortly after (about 1-2 minutes) I put the first coat on it started to craze. I probably did a total of 6 headlights worth ( I sanded the paint off a couple times) and 2 types of clearcoat (the first time a different type of Rust-Oleum than  you used and the second time, the exact model and brand you used). I tried heavy coating and light coating and it all seemed to end the same (the light coating seemed to take longer to craze).  The environment is about 78 deg in an open garage with  no wind. Any ideas on what things I could be doing wrong that are causing the problem."
I thought clear coat paint just worsen your headlights over time
"$250 each. that is nothing.
the headlights on my car are $750 each"
"Maybe a dumb question but after the clear coats, when wet sanding using the 2000 grit sandpaper and then the 3000 grit sandpaper, do you recommend the way the other wet sand methods before this? circular and then back with horizontal? Reason for asking is because you mention the horizontal was to keep the clear coat from dripping/bleeding and to give the clear coat something to ""hold on to"". Thanks!"
I remember the time that the car lights were glass and we didn't have any problems!! When it broke it was easy and cheap to change the glass too!
What is 99
I used a wipe that still had some sealer on it and now the grit from my sandpaper stick to the lens
Great video! I'm really thankful that you did this. I'm going to do my headlights tomorrow.
If I want to do it again after the clear coat how can I remove it?
"You know Chris, I've lost count of the number of your videos I've watched and I have ALWAYS learned something from every video. I am now 75 and been in transport all my working life. Thanks son. Cheers"
theres no such thing as permanent
"Chris, how do prevent new headlights from fogging up? Is there a way to make them last longer?"
is the clear coat required a dont really have time for the paint to cure can i just wax it instead every once in while ?
"Chris, thanks for the video! I followed the instructions and after the first coat, the clear coat started crazing (postage stamp size cracks). I sanded it all off, rewatched the video and tried again, which also didn't work, crazing again. During the first application it was near 85 but the clear coat indicated below 90 is ok. I was in my garage in the shade. The second attempt the temp was in the 70s. Any ideas. Also on my 2007 Nissan Frontier I decided to pull the lights off, which involved pulling off lots of trim, dropping the fascia, pushing in the wheel well liner to access bolts. I wouldn't do that again. Keeping in place and taping would have been easier."
Microfiber Towels bro
I love your instructional videos Dawg!
You think $250 is high for headlights? I have a neighbor with a Volkswagen Jetta that needed a headlight that costs $1300 for an aftermarket one. The OEM was over $3000. I've bought an entire car for half that price.
"This is an easy process that renders stellar results. 
Thanks Chris!"
you will regret doing that clear paint isn;t meant for that.....THIS WiLL RUIN your headlights
"We cannot find the paint mentioned in the video.  Is the ""USC SprayMax 2K Glamour High Gloss Aerosol Clear"" the replacement?"
Has anyone used an electric sander??
Being Master Painter 45 yrs in i would not recommend putting on spray clear ... Specially rust o leme I will start to break down in about 6mnths at 1yr it will start to chip off garunteed.. I would use minwax clear wax put on with steel wool oooo 4/0 and buff of with soft cotton cloth I reapply every 6 mnths and never have a problem !
Can you do this on red tailights
"I'm a sucker for new headlights but I'm trying your technique on my cheap flip car, new ones are $150+. That's profit instead of expense."
Bringing my 2003 Clio mk2 back to it's original state is such a blessing. Just from clear headlights it started to look gorgeous.
Dang is this old I love this channel
"Would this work on sheets of Plexiglas type stuff?  We have an old church with beautiful stained glass windows, but a plexiglas type sheet was put on the outsides of the windows, decades ago, to protect them.  They are now so cloudy and yellow that you can't even see the stained glass windows any more.  I'm wondering if this might work for that application as well."
no one noticed his face reflection lol thats how he looks
OMG CHRIS FACE REveal IN THE CAR REFLECTION
Can you do this on plastic headlights ?
"It almost sounds like you said ""take off the Bootay"" instead of blue tape.....lol"
"Excellent vid, great system ,"
"The way my buddy Trav restores headlights is by cleaning them, clay baring them, wet sanding them, compounding them twice, polishing them twice, and waxing them twice and for the compounding and polishing, he leaves them on the headlights for 3-5 minutes and"
Hi Chris! I'm about to install some new headlights should I apply some clear coat to them before I install?
"Hey Chris one question, if I had a little scratch on my headlight, would you recommend me to follow the instructions on this video? And do you think would I need to sand ALL the headlight or just the scratch area due to the new clearcoat spray?"
you can see his face in the reflection of the car
"1. What if the paint DOES run a little.  How do you smoothe that out right away so it doesn't dry that way?

2. Does that paint have any reaction to the heat of high beam halogens?"
"The reason this method doesn't last as it should is that the headlights are pretty hot when it is used. The paint isn't designed to work under that temperature. Try to touch it when it's on for a while, you'll see what I mean."
I just didn't mind and I'm on my first coat and I see cracking
"Okay, I watched a bunch of videos on this subject. So because I wanted to restore the headlights on my older model 2002 CRV, I decided to go with a video that said to use lemon juice and baking soda. So I cut a lemon in half and dipped it in the soda, rubbed it on and BOOM! I was shocked! Those lights were sooo bad. They came clean with little effort! Now I did realize you said permanent in this video. But the car I did is my old beater. Sooo, just saying!"
THANKYOU  SO MUCH CHRIS.
10 dollars but lots of work
"On one of your other newer headlight videos you used a ceramic coating vs 2k lacquer (I assume u used Rustoleum or 2k here?) as the final step. Which lasts longer? Also, isn't there a problem with peeling if you go over 600 grit on the last sanding cycle?"
"Bro this was the bomb! I tried so many methods but this really worked. It was more labor intensive but well worth it. I was about to buy headlight but you saved me 250.00 
You da man!!!"
Maybe 7 yrs ago 250 ea was alot of money. But the cheap  version  of mine are 300ea. My fathers hid head light in his 11 edge was 660ea. And there is alot worse then that too.
Just saw this an gonna try it out on 05 impala let you know later the results .but so far nothing has worked we'll see
can you drive the car before 24 hours? Cause I only have one car and need it for work and school
"Hi there, I use the car daily. Can I drive the car when the paint is still drying ?"
"Did all the steps in order... But my headlights now are clear, but have irreversible orange peel. Unless I sand it down again which I have and re sprayed. But it's still there, any way to fix this?"
"2022 here. Thanks Chris, I just tried this method and it worked great!"
"So glad there is a DYI. Thank you, your voice style and presentation is excellent. I feel confident to do this myself."
Awesome video! Thank you
"Hey, I have a question. Would enamel work the same as clear coat?"
"Just did this yesterday and I cannot believe how good my headlight looks! If you are having any doubts trust me, if you actually follow the steps you should be fine! Thanks ChrisFix!!!"
Thank you
"Well wouldn't EVERY other method also be a PERMANENT fix just by adding the clear coat spray step? Nonetheless, this is a great instructional video and a great way to fix those foggy headlamps."
"It is not permanent. I have a 2003 Tundra and the head lights and signal lights are perfect.  Toyota makes better everything.  Even  the hoses last 300K miles. I used the fix on a 2009 solstice. The fix starts showing  age in about 2 years. By year 4 in Florida, it needed to be redone."
I just finished doing every step of this video and it took me approx 30 mins. I stopped after spraying the top coat! Now my headlights look spanking new! I used Rust-oleum Universal Advanced Formula Clear Durable Topcoat! Thanks mucho!
"I used exactly the same paint, and it melted the plastic headlight. Now i have ti sand it all down and use different clear that will not melt the plastic"
Cool I tried it and it worked like a charm.
Or we could just bye new headlights
Or you could use blinker fluid..
"THE QUESTION I HAVE IS WHERE DO YOU GET ALL THOSE CARS HHHHHHHHHH  DO YOU GO TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD TO CLEAN FOR THEM ,,,,,CAN I BRING MY CAR  SO YOU CAN CLEAN THE ENGINE ,,,you get YouTube views I get clean engine hhhhh"
Just did this to 1 of my headlights and it looks amazing! I have to wait for it to try so I can sand and wax it! Thanks ChrisFix!
"This solution is not permanent. It lasted me 2 years, which is okay, I guess. The material you spray on eventually chips out. I did everything exactly as the video shows."
Nice job! I'll be trying this soon. I've had a set sanded down and had them shot with clear coat and sealant and a body shop. I'd do this from now on. Much cheaper.
"Just did this on a 20-year-old Montero Sport that felt downright dangerous to drive because of the dim, faded headlights. It's not 100% crystal clear, but still a night and day difference. Thank you!"
"This Exfoliating,"
I did all steps...but I got spider cracks web look.  Sand it and re do again.  Have same results.  Any advice??
Car-noob-a car wax.....who thought of these names....
Thanks again for good stuff.
Without plastic primer the clear coat spray will not last
how long should i wait to drive after applying the clear coat
Hey has anyone come across spider-type cracking look in their clear coat while applying first few coats?? I followed every single step and use the same exact spray as in the video.
"This worked so well for my 20 year old Toyota, I finished it with installing LED bulbs.
Thanks"
Chris can one use 1500grit if 2000 is not available?
It looks like a haircut.
This video was so awesome thank you so much for the know how. I subscribed as well.
That was great  I have been trying to do my headlights on my Dodge Ram 1500 I'm going to try your method I think it will work just by watching your video. Keep up the good work and I'll let you know the results.
"I have younger friends that play the old Punch buggy game, but with PTs instead of VW beetles. They yell Cruiser Bruiser as they punch your arm."
"I dod this with 400-600-1200 grit. After that, 5 layers of clearcoat. 4 thin and 1 a bit thicker. For now, even without wax the look like new!

I plan on polishing and waxing them, will post here my thoughts! Hope it will be helpful for anyone who reads this"
How to restore a fog light for2006 Subaru Impreza
Not a comment...Question...Can this be done to repair taillights that are getting hazy?
your da man!
"I used 1000,1500 and 2000 grit sandpaper and finally buffed with T-Cut scratch remover. Result is awesome."
Nice.!
Is it possible to use ceramic coating and wax instead of the clear coat?
i see you in the reflection of the car
"Ok big question here.
Lets say I sprayed too much and it did run (I didnt know what runing paint looked like but I realise now that its the high tech crossword looking shapes and craks) how would I fix that? I ended up doing that to my car and to a Much lesser extent my dads. Im fine with messing up my car but not anyone elses
Do I need to start over from scratch? Should I worry about how that will affect the headlights at night? 
If I dont need to start over from scratch then whats the procedure?"
"Can I drive my car after I do the clear coat application?, before it dries? Within the 24 hr period? Or do I have to leave the car sitting for 24 hours?"
What do Do if I painter to much on the lens and it ran .  Some runs and such.  Can Ijust sand with 2000 the runs out and reapply..  other lens is great.  2000 Camry
"What method works better? This way or the one that uses compound, polish, and ceramic coating?"
"this is literally less steps than what the 3M kit suggest. i use the 3 M kit on my rx7, and it's lasted years. (also apply clear coat later on)"
Great video ! I did this two years ago on my 2005 Honda Pilot .Still looks very good to this day.Way better than it did before.
Greatest video ever worked on my Camry like a charm!
The headlight is the best thing about that car now
"Tried this out and everything was going well until the clear coat started cracking, at first thought it was maybe too cold and the breeze was making it dry unevenly but now doing it again on warm day and decent but within the can's specs for humidity, did about 8-10 between coats and did light-med coats. 5th coat it started cracking again in the top right corner. Not sure the issue, what are factors to consider like winds or direct sunlight as opposed to in the shade. Want to get this down to finish the rest I need to do"
Been a while Chris but would it be better to spray the clear coat starting off the headlight and finishing off it on the other side
"I don't know, I did exactly this several years ago and the head lights are once again yellow. When sanding, make sure to keep the surface wet, otherwise you could burn the acriyllic. Also sand in 1 direction ONLY, otherwise the light can deflect."
It was $20 then but with inflation nows $200
"For a minute I thought this was a Chris fix copy cat, then I saw it was from 7 years ago. Thanks for your videos,  they've been a huge help through the years."
"Spraying the clear coat on I realised I was doing it too heavy and got some runs and many cracks in areas I sprayed too much, unfortunate but does this mean I should sand down the clear coat in a day and then try again"
2X or 2K witch one is better?
Can i buy that clear coat in my local paint shop?
Restored a motorcycle helmet visor that was mistreated with bad cleaning product. Probably not worth it money-wise but damn satisfying for sure.
"What worked for me was a low cost buffer with a terry cloth pad, and oxidation remover for gelcoat boat hulls. Mask off surrounding area, or remove assembly. Took about twenty minutes per assembly, and they looked like new again."
"Well done, and you're right,,,,I did mineown with these same instructions ,it helped getting the car pass inspection, bad lens made it fail,,,,thanks man !"
Almost the best way    but helped me out a lot
Damn that mad reflection just gave away your identity.
Thx mate awesome
"Hey Chris, clear coat after wet sanding 3rd coat dried clear but has lines running through, looks like the mortor lines on a rock fence."
Outstanding video outstanding
You are amazing thank you
Or you can go to Walmart Auto Care Center and let them do it for the same price.
Thats a pt cruiser nothing is going to raise its value
Hello chrisfix if I get a haze after putting on the clear coat how to remove it?
Hello sir..the clear gloss you're using is simply the one we can buy at any paint center?
Hey Chris! Do you know how to restore the reflective chrome inside the light?! Thanks Martin from London
I started a whole business  cause of this video thank you Chris!!!!
Hey Chris I know this video is old but hoping you can help me out everything went great however I accidentally sprayed a bit to much clear coat at the end and there is droplets would you recommend just repeating the steps 400 600 then 2000 grit again?
You are too much men.
Sorry for the newbie question but what does he mean to buff out the headlights after waxing them?
"Excellent.  I just learned that Sylvania also puts out a lens repair sealer kit for ten bucks.  You provide the sandpaper, they provide the activator and the clearcoat wipe-on liquids."
Excellent Video. Much Appreciated.
Woah I saw your face without helmet 11:57
Great job it's looks great hey I got my blazer running today I guess it was just a vapor lock on it I was going to get a fuel pump in it and I didn't want to get look bye the way thx for all you show us I'm going to this to my blazer I need it thx for sharing this it's better then the other people method s
I cleaned mine they came out clear like new who was the genius that came up with this plastic lenses  sealed beam headlights were better in my opinion you never had to clean them they never got dirty the only thing you might have to do every now and then you may have to replace sealed beam headlight and they weren't as expensive as replacing a bulb in one of these new cars nevermind replacing the lens in one of these new cars it's all about money cheesy cars plastic bumpers don't know why they call them bumpers you touch something they crack and fall off
You talk too much
(
Every job Chris does is brilliant.
"If it doesn't turn out well, can you start over and sand off the clear coat?"
Worked like a charm....
"Will this work on my car, I live in middle of the desert, where my headlights get yellowed very often"
Hey ChrisFix. So ive done three coats and i think on the first coat after it dried it had cracks running through it like dry dirt that hasnt seen rain in years. Could be because i used brake cleaner to clean the headlight. I hope you or someone has an answer.
Is there any real difference between the Rust-Oleum Automotive clear coat and their regular clear coat?
What if we have to drive our car within those 24 hours? Will it matter
Sir tutorial on how to replace freeze plugs.
Just use metal polish. Works the same and will cost less
Good video. I hate those videos to try to sell me crap. This was very informative and knowing what I know about polishing is very accurate.
Off bug spray cleans my headlights.
OR you could use 10 cents worth of brake fluid once a year.  Just wipe it on and cleans them up like magic!  Takes about 30 seconds.
It's weird that the headlights are made out of plastic these days i think that it is a major downgrade from glass ones because my car is 24 years old and it's glass headlights are only a little bit dirty and don't need any restoration
Wow thanks so much Chris!  Just did this on my mk1 Audi TT and the results are totally astonishing.  I tried several methods over a few weeks and this was hands down the best.  Nothing else comes close.  Personally I removed headlights and made a little spray booth :)
This is a brilliant idea....off to try it now!! I am quite the beginner when it comes to basic car knowledge....so this maz be a dumb question......But can i use turps as the alcohol agent? Thanks in advance and I LOOOOOOVE your videos!!!
If i just used 3000 grit by itself after a few days on the clear coat and then polish is that good enough or do i need to use 2000 3000 then 5000 then polish?
So do you have to leave the trash bag on the car after you complete the final step with the clear coat??
Just did my 05 Camry headlights. It went exactly as Chris said it would. Can't believe how much brighter they are and they look great too.
EXACTLY! And some off the whitening toothpastes have a little more grit! Great Vid!
"I've done pretty much the same, only added 1000 and 1500 grit paper in between the 600 and 2000. Less hazy when finished."
SCREW THIS VIDEO- use wd40
OR YOU COULD GRAB A CAN OF WD40 you have laying under the sink amd a paper towel
the clear coat started cracking on my headlights how do i fix that?
"Still looks hazy as heck. All wet n dry - 800, 1200, 2000, 5000, 10000. Use a sealant polish once a month. No clear coat, you'll end up with the same problem and have to scrape it all off (with great difficulty) with a razor blade and repeat the whole process. FW1 is good to start off with before sanding to get some of the old yellow crap off. Good finisher before sealant too."
"use total auto  uv protecting sealants,...problems solved,..."
Love the video good video good lil Information
"Awesome vid, just tried this today for my wrx bugeye, can't wait to see the finish. 
@chrisfix you mentioned at the end we can wet sand it, is that with 2000 grit? 
Thanks!"
"Chris, another great video. Do you have a video on how to repair paint chips on a front bumper?"
Thanks for this video HM! Thanks
"Im at home in Wales UK, its 5am, and I seem to be on a binge watch of Chrisfix vids. This is so much better than mainstream tv."
Hey guys Chris fix here
"It isn't I do not trust you,  I do not trust me"
"Would this also work if the plastic has ""micro checking""  that can only be seen at night or placing a powerful light parallel to the lens?"
The reason why this will not work is because the fog buildup is on the inside of the glass.
"Hi Chris. I have  question about the clear gloss coat. I applied it on both and it looks like it began to run on one. As it set/dried the gloss coat looks cracky/separating on the passenger side. Also, it still looks foggy. I'm thinking to re sand it.  What would you suggest? Thank you and take care."
"Chris,
     You are the MAN!!!  I have an 06 Mustang GT & my lights were HORRIBLY oxidized...followed your advice and they came out Fantastic!!!  Thanks for your expertise!!!"
"Chris sensei teaches me paper on paper off, mist there mist gone"
"This isn't what I'd hoped.  Someone literally broke off my windshield wiper assembly and after buying a new one from the dealer at about $100, it came with no instructions on how to take off the broken wiper assembly and replace it with the new one.  Do you know how to do this?  :)"
There is no permanently as long as your car stays out of the Sun.
"just done this after finding this video, clear currently drying and yep, currently looks mint ,i used 800 then 2000 grit as all i had, and had already tried off the shelf headlight cleaner which had got a lot of the initial yellowing off, not all though, cheers"
Is it ok to paint it with urethane?
"K good tip but not permanent of course, uv will destroy anything eventually, plus the clear coat might chip like the factory one. Even a good ceramic coating only lasts 5 years before nature breaks it free for further natural processing until finally it becomes live life energy once again."
just needs some blinker fluid lol
"Your explanations are ""THE BEST"" I ever seen in any videos. Very good job, thankyou."
Hey Im putting on very light coats and still get running paint. Any suggestions????? To fix it
I like my PT Cruiser. It s cute. Set up weird. Like the controls for the back windows !!   Thanks
He tripled the value of the lovely Pt Cruiser. Now worth at least 12 to 15 dollars.
Would 2500 grit work ? I bought a set but didn't come with 2000
"Hi Thanks for the video, I followed your instrustions to a tee, however when I sprayed the Rust-oleum I noticed it didnt go on smooth it left lots of cracks, like glass cracking..Before i prayed I cleaned the headlights with Metholated spirits, left it to dry and then spayed. Will saning this after get rid of the cracks?"
Do you have to use wax ?
Use bug of spary green bottle it work the best
"NIce, Very Well Done!"
Do we really have to wait 24 hours ? With or without driving it ?
How do you know when to switch from 400 to 600 and when to switch to the 2000 grit?
"You don't want to over spray
*proceeds to empty the can*"
"This video is a big lie. None of this works.












Everyone knows you need to buy some headlight fluid."
"I appreciate this.
I just got a set of JDM projectors for my 1995 Subaru Legacy postal wagon and while they look a thousand times better than the old stock ones on it now, they're still not suuuper clear. I will be using this process on the projectors before installation. Thanks for the detailed video on this. It's gonna help me a lot, I already can tell."
I cringe a little when he say water
"Thank you very much for this video....  The STEP-BY-STEP narration is perfect for a first-timer.
Your advice is much appreciated, Chris Fix !"
30milion views?! Damn!
Say water again
Wd-40?
"I did this yesterday, although I used lots more grits, and the masking tape came off with all of that water.  Painter's tape is just blue [or green] masking tape with a weaker adhesive, right?  I am going to remove my headlight try again, but I fear some of the yellow haze is internal."
From what I'm seeing in the comments after sanding I can polish them with any compound then add the uv sealant at the end?
"Watched and followed your instructions step by step.  And the end result on my headlights were 10 times worse than they were originally.  The 2k clear coat not only made the headlights look worse , but now I have orange peel look on them even after rubbing them back and re doing them , still no better."
I'm a car detailer 20 years  the sandpaper is good  but I use 500 then 1000 then 2000 them 500o then rubbing compound and a sealer even still your way doesn't last forever come on man be real even my way doesn't last
i don't have a garbagebag
Thank you for this! Any reason why you wouldn't just tape the bag to the car from the beginning and have it there for the entire process?
After three years the clear coat is starting to fog up. This is the only way to go when it comes to cleaning up your headlights. 10/10 would recommend again and again.
"Does this work even if the headlight is not rough? Maybe the hazing or yellowing is on the inside, would this still work?"
Bro I love your accent could listen to you all day
WAX ON WAX OFF !
"Chris, can u use a microfiber cloth instead of the paper towel?"
This worked wonderfully on my car!!
Did you do this with a PT Cruiser so that if you mess it up you can just throw the whole thing away guilt free?
What is the point of the horizontal sanding with the 400 grit if you are just going to sand it with 600 grit anyway?
"Did this today, following your instructions.  Perfect finish, just like new - and they were in poor shape.  Thanks a lot."
I used a compound for the final step before applying my coating
"Just did everything on the steps, my Acura looks amazing thank you chrisfix!"
So is this a real fix it?
"After I put on the clear coat, the headlights look all cracked should I sand it with the 2000 or just leave it and put the wax"
"Hey Chris, if you do this again for any reason, reckon you could chuck up a photo of headlights on with 1 clear lens and the other lens dirty/hazy . Would be interesting to see the difference in light output. My car needs doing but it's my house atm so unfortunately has to wait, just like the other $2-3000 work it needs"
Hello Chris - what would be your recommendation to protect the headlight from new - ie to prolong the clarity of the factory UV-resistant coating? Thanks for your excellent videos.
Does it work good on a 15 nissan aultima
What about baking soda and vinegar
What about the baking soda and orange
Nice
First you said no wax second what happens when that clear coat chips off just as you said the factory does?
Slow your passes down a bit and you won't get as much fog  when you clear coat I suggest getting a junk rattle can of cheap paint and practice your passes on some cardboard or something try to get a slight over lap from the previous pass to the next then go hit your lights
Whuter
Suckered into paying $95
"$250 ea? You haven't priced headlights for a Lexus. My wife's RX (with self-leveling HID headlight) were $1200 EACH when one was replaced (due to an accident) over 10yrs ago. I'm REALLY glad insurance paid for it.

GREAT job on showing the benefits of this job at the beginning. Thanks for this."
i got grate results thanks chris
Have you ever tried to use a heat gun to restore headlights?
Amazing!!!!!
The Cerakote -ceramic fix for headlights worked really well for me. I should have waxed for longer lasting results. It doesn't involve taping or spraying. Very clear and just barely starting to wear from the intense desert heat in Nevada. Car is never in the shade. 1yr later.
Do not do on a windy day. : )
what is wooder?
"Thanks man. I was able to apply this knowledge today, the lights were really bad to start with; both yellow and clouded. 

I applied the (wet) 400 grit with light pressure, got the slush you mentioned and it just kept going and going, producing the sludge. It left me wondering if it was ever going to stop producing this sludge. When it finally did, I thought they only looked a little better. I went to (wet) 600, same sludge story. Got through it, cleaned with alcohol, applied the (wet) 2000 grit without producing sludge. Cleaned with alcohol again and applied two layers of clear gloss. Dried for 10 minutes and applied two layers again. So far so good, no orange peel visible, but it's still drying.

Thought it was only a small difference, until I held it next to the second, untouched, headlight and holy sh*t what a difference. It really looks like new, amazing! 

You know content is good when 7(+) years after posting it's still relevant and has an amazing impact, thanks again Chris!"
I think you just added 10hp and decreased the 0-60 time by 2 seconds w this mod!
And also cause a car not to pass inspection in Virginia
a PT Cruiser how embarrassing
bug spray works with no sanding. honest. spray and wipe.
"I have watched a number of vids on this, and this is the best I have found. I won't just buy new headlights as my time is free when I also enjoy doing diy."
Amazing!  I live on a very fixed income and wasn't sure how I was going to afford new headlights...  Mine are really bad!  Thank you for passing on the knowledge!!!
Terrific!
Nice demo. Thanks
Wow
I see a crackhead cleaning them with bug spray
I followed your instructions and it worked great. 2 years later and due to the rain in Los Angeles the clear has started to bubble and chip off. What should I do to remove the hardened clear coat? It appears to chip off very quickly on the parts the water remained. There are places where it is well adhered. Thank you Chris.
"Hi Chris I followed the instructions on restoring your headlights, using 1st 600 grit and then 2000 grit to wet sand the plastic. Then I cleaned it off with Isopropyl alcohol  and masked it up for spraying. I used Rustoleum Gloss Clear 2X (also bonds to plastic) non yellowing, in a rattle can. I ended up with a crazed finish, so I wet sanded the light again and tried spraying again. The 1st coat crazed almost immediately, as it started to dry, while I watched it.  Any ideas on where I'm going wrong with this? I've left the light with one crazed coat on it, so it can fully cure, before I sand it off and begin the process over again. The Rustoleum can looks exactly the same as the can you used on the demonstration. What do think might be the cause of the problem? Chris Skinner Auckland New Zealand"
"I have done autobody and paint for over 30 years and I used sand paper but I used 600 if needed. (wet sand) then 1200 grit then 2000 grit. Now the one thing you should use is dawn dish washing soap in your water. Soak your paper in a bucket with a few drops of soap in the water you filled the bucket with. use soap in your spray bottle. Not only does it lubricate your sand paper it super cleans your surface. If you hear a squeaking sound sanding you have a rock or other hard chunk in-between your paper and surface and it is scratching the crap out of your surface. Stop and clean off the paper. 
I disagree with your take on the 2000 grit, just sand it normal, it is taking out the larger  deeper scratches. I could see when you were sanding you had areas that was separating and needed to be sanded more.
 The paint jobber has or can get a can of 2k clearcoat. it is in a can with hardener. There is a button on the bottom you push and you shake the can to mix and spray it like he did. 1st coat is a tack coat it is a light mist that helps the clear stay. Make sure it is uniform and even across the entire surface. Then  wait 5 min do a light to medium coat,  1-2 more light to medium coats Your last coat can be a solid medium coat. Once you hit the button and mix it you got around 8 hours to use it. SprayMax 3680061, 2K Urethane Clear Coat"

"Doing this for the second time (fog lights on my Trailblazer), in the past I did my Buick, and might I say it never fogged or hazed again. I'll be adding LED fogs and having a clear lense will make it that much better. I'll be upgrading my headlight housing or else I would do those too."
"I finished doing one headlight and I followed all steps but messed up with spraying a heavy coat that ran a bit and now it looks hazy, will wet sanding it after one day remove that haze?"
"Did this to my sister's Corolla, just finished painting and it looks much better. If only I didn't mess up the first coat"
The old car just had LASIC surgery.
I wonder where do you get all these ideas Chris where I believe there's no other Chris fix like you especially way back then. Thanks for this Chris!
"Wouldn't recommend on an old 2002 mercury grand marquis, the little divots that pop out from the plastic make it hard to clean with sandpaper but you can make it look better"
I did this to My Mums car she asked what I did to her headlights she kept trying to turn off the full beams that were not active. I explained it to her and she started parking her car the oppsite way t avoud UV damage to the cars lenses.
Big Don
What about responding 7 years later ;)
Hi so I just did this and It is running what do I do??
Awesome video. I've already got sandpaper and the exact same clear coat paint you were using from other projects I do. Just got a '99 Mercedes with under 100K on it but headlights are faded bad. I'm fixing to put a end to that.  Thank you .
"Done this with plastic long before most of you have been alive! I don't believe in snake oil.Because it doesn't work! I have seen others
 fail. Protect painted areas.use common scenes tape or remove. start 
with wet sand  400 600 grit depending on cloudiness. Don't be very 
aggressive until  you see how it cuts. work in one direction only,work 
your way up to 800. then use a power buffer to polish. use a product 
like Meguiar's DIAMOUND CUT COMPOUND  2.0  85. When you are using a 
power buffer.the heat that is generated seals the plastic. One could 
make a business of doing this. takes about an hour per light,depending 
on how bad. Last for years! Done this with plastic long before most of you have been alive!"
One thing to add! Anytime we use sandpaper of any grit it has to be buffed out even using a 3000 grit. This will make it smooth. The wax you put on will make it smooth for a few days but will come off. Wax is used only as a protectant for the body of a vehicle
"Oh, btw I just got an 02 Taurus from my grandmother with 28.400 miles on it. I'm going to flush all systems and switch to synthetic oil. Tires have flat spots on them and one brake scene stuff also the door locks keep trying to lock while driving Non-Stop, I'm guessing that has something to do with the driver side brake caliper maybe a speed sensor? I would appreciate any input"
"Hey chrisfix, I just discovered your videos by accident. I have a remodeling business so I great with my hands. My issue was I don't want to break things on cars but your vids definitely showed me that almost anyone car work on cars, at least the older ones. Great job bro!"
What do you do when the plastic has crazing going deep into the plastic?
"This is the way Dad and I fixed ours also!!
Such an amazing technique that he would do it to customers headlight covers as well!!
Thank you for sharing because the word needs to get out on how things like this can,
help people save loads of money in this crazy expensive World we live in."
"""hey guys ChrisFix here, and todang..."""
"Hi Chris! i did this today and the clear coat was runny, is there any way i can fix it?"
This is absolutely perfect
"Well Chris, I finally got around to trying this and as it turns out I am one of those over-sprayers you talk about.  Yes, it ran.  To make matters worse I tried to wipe it off and completely ruined it.  I waited 48 hours and started all over again using the same steps.  I just put the third LIGHT coat on the headlights and will let it sit for 24 hours.  I can tell already they will not be perfect but they will be pretty darn close.  I am happy with the results.  Thanks Chris."
Unfortunately this is NOT permanent. But it is a great and longer lasting alternative.
You really should use an adhesion promotor.
That water bottle needs its prostate checked
"Doing something yourself, especially auto related, when car stuff is so intimidating to you and seeing the results and that it worked not only makes the car look good and functional but makes you feel like you CAN do things and that's a good feeling."
"Great instructions with video, can't wait to do this."
Tip for the sanding. Dont push forward and back with your hand. Go side to side to avoid your fingers putting grooves in the surface.
"I did this with 1000 then 2000 and then buff well.. it comes out very nice, but....I think I should have done the clear coat to top it off.."
Lkj
"When I tried to use the 2000 grid sandpaper to wetsand the orange peel off, I can't get it off. How long am I supposed to do this step for?"
"what do i do if i oversprayed, do i just do this whole process again?"
Amazing thanks!!
"Unfortunately,  none of these clear coats are UV  so  in a year or so,  the  clear coat fades and yellows... In this day and age, you need to go to 3000 grit,  then buff it out  with an orbital buffer  with high grade compound polishing, followed up with ceramic coating that protects it against UV, Oir,  chemical splatter  in the rain and other debris...  The time you spend  for the 20.00  vs  the 120  you spend having it done  by a  pro with all the supplies  and done in an hr.   its kind of a no brainer.  Plus,  No leaving the car overnight and having to go back the next day...."
"Hey Chris, This was a great help. I restored my headlights and they look much better than the cracked peeling yellow clear coat before. You do really excellent work and I hope your channel keeps growing ...Julian South Africa"
"I don't know about you professional guys or lady's, but am on a fixed income, and I can't waste my money on various kinds of sand paper, and clear coats.  I think I'll stick with gritty toothpaste and put some on my washed light, dry it and add the toothpaste, and scrub in with a tooth brush, and then wipe it off with warm water, and redo it till the film is off.  Maybe after the yellow junk is off of it, I will then add a clear coat just to keep it clean till summer comes around again.  Poor man's way of doing a clean light."
This is it.  I am giving this a run on my 2006 Impreza at the end of the year during time off.  thank you!
"Just change the headlight housings and bulbs if you prefer to, it's not that hard.. it only takes an hour if you know what you're doing and 2 if you don't, it would probably take you just as much time to change them by the time you restore your headlights to your liking"
Fantastic video. Thanks.
Hi Chris ! When do we apply the compound polish ? Is that at the end ? @chrisfix
"Good job, thanks."
I really miss glass headlights
Great job man!!! love it.
"Honestly I sanded and buffed, then applied Mcguires. Worked great"
"""You didn't even have to take the headlight of if you didn't want to"" looks at pt,... doesn't wanna have to disassemble the whole front half of car to remove headlight"
My headlight pods are 600 a piece from Acura!!  This method is the end all.
sweet imma do this.
what do you think about replacing the last step with clear uv protective film instead of clear coating?
Calling this permanent is a stretch.  It's essentially the same as OEM which (obviously) was not permanent.
OMG! I tried this on my 2015 toyota harrier it worked thank you so much
"Nice, great tutorial .."
"nice technique, good job and great results"
Gonna try this tomorrow
"The cleaning part can be done with toothpaste and kitchen towel. Wet the headlight, Put 0.5cm line of toothpaste, and work it with a couple of squares of paper towel. Rinse, Repeat 2-3 times. Done. Worked wonderfully well on my 2003 Subaru, they're  Mint now :)"
add a little dishwasher detergent and the paper will not clog.
I've had good results using rubbing compound after the 2500 grit.  Then clean with the alcohol etc. and spray the clear coat.
Use a spray mister.
My headlights were 899.99 bro... where u getting em for 100 dollars??? Lol
"The 3m kit is amazing, but buy some clear coat wipes to boot. I use Nu Polish and meguiars ultimate compound on them too"
I'm glad I watch a few or more of these videos before I just go and do it .to see what to do and what not to do some people have the right meaning just not totally right way in the long run be careful and watch plenty of these videos  and ask around or ask pro too then you should be good to go
After sanding you should have polished the headlight a few times before the clear coat . But I'm not going to use clear coat on my headlight I'll use a headlight protectant coat one a year instead or us the clear paint guard over it when I'm done and when needed I'll peel it off and a new one on.
Chris fix is the shit
"Could fine P600
Is P800 okay?"
I followed exact steps used the same clear coat and when the paint dried it looked like a spider's web...what the heck...I sanded the headlights again and will now try with 2k clear...why did it dry like a spiderweb cracks all over
Nice. I did all that you described.  Lasted 1 year. Next.
The best I've seen so far ' going to try it.
"back then he sounded so scared but now he sounds super confident 
i even remember watching this in my other account when it uploaded
love your content m8"
"I did this on my 2003 Nissan Altima yesterday. I must have coated it way to much, after 24 hours the clear coat looks runny on my lights. Help! What do I do to restore it?"
I'm amazed!!! Update: I actually did this and the results were fantastic! I can't thank you enough for all the empowerment you provide. God bless you!
"Doing my 2004 acura tsx today! 237,000 miles. Still going..."
Won't the paint come off?
Would Wipe-on Poly work with this method?
Does this work is the issue is a peeling clear coat? My lights aren't clouded like this but the factory clear coat is peeling off...
after sanding i've tried rubbing compound and polish then alcohol then clear coat. Works good as well.
anyone else see an anime grls in the headlights
What if I get a little running first coat?
Are this way used to repair the crushes of bicycle made of Carbon ?
"I've done this a few times on different cars and it works well BUT it is NOT a permanent fix.   I'm pretty sure Chris knows this but is saying permanent as compared to WD40.  This will need to be repaired yearly or every few years, the clearcoat does peel, chip or bubble if your lights are really hot."
I just did this to the letter using the same clear and my clear is full of hairline cracks all over the headlight!!!
If this is a permanent fix does that mean that the factory used low grade clearcoat?
"Hey Chrisfix, just came across your channel here this weekz and decided to give my car headlights this treatment. They do look a million times better than before, however I found when the clear coat spray dried there was a ""crack"" pattern across the headlights. Any ideas why that might have happened?... They definately aren't cracked lol"

"You should've used turtle wax polishing compound for the final  buff they would of
come out nice and clear."
Damn my Lexus headlights are 650 each.
Very concise great video. Tks.
What is the reason car manufactures went to plastic instead of glass?? Why don't they just go back to making glass headlights ?  Or am I that dumb and missing something ??
"Clear coating the headlights eventually will dry out and look worse then the lens itself,  it will take about a year for this to happen but in most case's you will be worse off then you were before when you find yourself wet sanding the clear coat back off,  just use mothers aluminum wheel polish and any kind of silicone instant detailer spray this takes about 5 minutes per headlight and last 3 to 6 months depending on weather conditions"
Can you do the same mod on brand new headlights? Of course not the sanding down Part
"You probably want to apply the spray right after it's rained or under higher humidity conditions since there's much less likely to be dust and particles in the air that could stick to it as it dries.

Unless you already have the luxury of a dust-free environment to work in."
"as an amateur mechanic who bought his first car for 750 bucks 2 years ago; these videos are awesome! restored my first car and sold it for 2500 and now i got to afford my dream car, a 3k civi- nah joking, a 3k busted to hell shelby mustang 2004 v8 which paint is a patina at this point but mechanically speaking it isn't too bad either, thanks for the videos fren :)"
"Well this is a good way to do this, however that Lacquer doesnt have a lot of UV protection. Youre better off using a 2K auto clear or even a 1K auto clear . Several companies make them in aerosol  (Upol etc) They are made for ""spot"" repairs or even blending clear. They offer much more in the way of durability and UV protection than off the shelf lacquer. I used to restore headlights for my customers at my collision shop. Wet sand, buff to a super smooth non hazy clear finish, then 1500/2000 grit wet sand and GOOD clear."
"Chris, what about using a 1 inch polisher with a fine head .....and some sort of cutting, followed by polishing agent? I've been considering doing this to an old Mercedes I have access to...the headlights are annoyingly hazed..."
Can you clear coat new headlights for added protection??
I followed the instructions  and after sanding and prior to painting the headlight is foggier than it was before. Did I do something wrong?
