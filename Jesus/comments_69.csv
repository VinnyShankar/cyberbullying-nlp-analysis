Humans are seriously weird asf lol
1:15
That poor gorilla was abused and exploited by a woman who used it for personal fame and money. The poor thing begged to have a baby and they always made her wait. There was one brief moment that they amost let it happen. The poor thing is on video with a plastic human baby doll trying to breastfeed it and she constantly wanted a baby and to be woith other gorillas. That witch that 'trained' her wouldn't allow it because Koko was her meal ticket.
I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED COCO!!!
I was not CUTE ENOUGHT!!!!!!!
She was loved and she loved back but I think she must of been very sad at times that she was kept like that
"Cure
Koko"
For anyone who is downplaying ASL please explain your ignorance to the thousands who use it as their only language.
Ahh this is nothing new. I live in the hood and see them communicate all the time! Not really that amazing
"Of course, I Googled Koko. She does not actually 'talk'-only used sign language. Clickbait...."
The title is click bait.
"It's interesting that this was so much more of a success than Project Nim; 
considering consistency of conditions actually played a part in this study, so
as not to frequently uproot and traumatize its subject.


Granted, I doubt it would have ended as badly as Project Nim ever did, 
considering Gorillas are inherently less aggressive than chimps, only ever
displaying it as a red herring or act of protection, and have greater social and
rational intelligence than chimps."
Used to call an ex my Koko. In hinsight he didn't deserved it at all. Koko was much nicer and empathic.
signing is considered talking?
T-Bone is very upset!
I miss her so much. I really wanted her to have a baby though. She was the sweetest gorilla ever and always will be.
Cutee
I love koko
Go James Franco
Click bait
Hi my name's Koko the gorilla hope you liked this video please hit like and subscribe
theres always one thing that separates us from our closest relatives
Where?
the study along time ago by the man who raised a chimpanzee and a baby together showed early on they were so very close in their abilities but I believe at the age of around 2 or 3.. The human baby literally exploded beyond the chimps ability causing it to get angry and frustrated which led an end to the study..
"spoiler, she uses sign, dosent actually speak."
Who does this guy's voice remind you of?
"Animals already tell us what they feel. 

For Example, my cat screws with my stuff when he wants food."
"So what? Big deal.

Most Africans can talk."
Koko B Ware
"So what's new, trump can also talk"
Soooooo koko uses sign language not actually trys to talk...
RIP Koko!
"i thought it was harambe


rip"
Koko is home...
"Annnnd, you don't get to see the animal talking."
And the answer.......?
CEASAR IS HERE! AND HE WILL REIGN SUPREME!
"My cat communicates his thoughts and feelings to me regularly.

We get along just fine."
wonderful. Thanks for the video. :D
I miss koko on Facebook.

"People talk about human right Animal right but where is that....a ko ko always want to be a mom but where is her right ...she was always Headline people's TV channels,news peper's but nobody talk about her feeeling uts means people just used an animal ....wheverever she is restvin peace....if she has hers husband many be she has babys n may be she teach silent language to her babys"

"Why they should end PB's, socialism, social insecurity, taxes welfare food stamps. There'd be plenty of unbacked money"
There's a difference between talking and communicating.

Eh no he doesn't talk
"My head was all like ""ANOTHER SAIYAN!! """

Legal rights are nonsense.
Harambe V2.0
Click bait!!!!!!!
So where's the part where it talks
"aww...........she is so cute with a human



i wish i was the owner"
I Thought it was actually gonna talk
Clickbait at it's finest lol
"Did Koko have a concept of life and death and what happens when you die?
I think I saw a video somewhere,  but I can not find it. Can anyone help?"
Why is this recommended?
"O KoKo 
You are missed ."
And George just wanted to be called T Bone...
It's fake there's no proof
They have a book about this
"""Ok so basically I'm monky"""
Most Millennials never heard of koko
"Koko is very unique ,and deserves to stay with her,it does look like a mother and daughter relationship"
So I didn't hear coco talking stupid video
Sieza.
"I expected the gorrilla to say ""SUP BITCHES"""
What the heck is this comment section?
People say in the future robots should have rights but nobody cares about the rights of actual living things
I'm in love with the Koko!
But how
"I guess that animals can communicate with humans in different ways but if you want an animal to communicate like Koko, they must have something that they can communicate with. In Koko's case, she uses her hands."
RIP Koko
cessar
R.I.P
Did koko die I think so
I think Koko could teach the other gorillas how to be human so the could evolve.
1:18 is so sweet!
So you are saying my old class teacher is'nt the only one.
It's hilarious all the people who don't understand that there is s difference between talking and speaking.
We had chapter on him
Great video is so happy
OMG WINSTON
Did someone say peanut butter...?
"Sadly Koko has now passed away from old age

They can communicate with humans. Its just that theyre not supposed to.
"koku ""U can use ur middle finger to  whoever disagrees with you"""

This shit scary
Koko do you love me?
So basically... I'm monky
Can Koko say fuck
Can koko read the bible?
People who disliked this video are just jealous he's smarter than them lol
Title is a bit misleading..
Want to listen...if you smell what the rock is cooking from him
"There are some powerful criticisms of the claims of Koko's alleged abilities. The bonobo Kanzi has much more impressive abilities and anyone can see this. You don't need his handler to interpret a sign language that is only understood by the two of them.  Kanzi uses pictures and objects. They taught Kanzi to start a fire. There's no faking that.

Robert Sapolsky is a famous psychologist and has studied and lived with baboons for years.  https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/8t6en7/a_stanford_professor_speaks_at_length_about_koko/"

Ape time travels to say humans were much smarter back in history
I like his nails.

I wouldn't mind coexisting with another talking species.  It might even expand our knowledge of the lives of animals if they can just tell us.
HE DOUBLE KO US
i need to be ready..for war!!
"CLICKBAIT, KOKO US NOT TALKING, SHE IS USING SIGN LANGUAGE ,SO SHE'S NOT TALKING,WE HAVE TO HERE WORDS FROM HIS MOUTH"

Aww my puppies name is coco with a c instead of k
Koko what kinda name is that.. some kinda cool guys name..
PBS with the clickbait tho
My class was learning about Koko.
There are no footages that when koko's talking?
As someone who is both deeply religious and spiritual I have always thought that animals are far smarter than we give them credit for. It's obvious we are vastly superior intellect wise but that doesn't mean they don't feel more simple versions of the emotions we do. I've had a few experiences where I legitimately felt as if I was communicating with an animal almost subconsciously as they would often do as I asked or express happiness at a remark I would make. If you'll allow a bit of a hippy some speculation I think much of animal communication is done through Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) electromagnetic fields and we humans have lost this ability in favor of greater intellect and verbal communication. Imagine the efficiency of language if we could learn to once again communicate as the animals do and combine it with the spoken word.
Wish cud hear him talk tho
God make us unique nobody can  be better than us
The starting music to this vid sounds like something from far cry 5
Didnt hear the gorilla say one word. This video is clickbait.
I want to hear koko talk
"Koko knows more vocab words than me, I'm so jealous."
"Cool!
I want to speak with him
I will say: IM A BANANA IM A BANANA IM A BANANA LOOK AT MEH MOVEEE BANANA POWER BANANA POWER BABANANAAA"
"Roses are red 
Violets are blue 
I came here to see Koko talk and so did you"
Plot twist: Koko was the narrator
Oh yeah she is mute but she talks....do you see how stupid that sounds?
"Oprah talks, not a first."
Oh my god
Coco is a sweety I love her
so did it talk...
Kneel before grodd or kneel before Cesar
"i was so fascinated about her and robin williams. If i could have dinner with anyone living or dead , it would be Koko. lol"

Birds talk. Whales have their own unique languages. Is it really so extraordinary that this beautiful girl could learn to speak as well?
", of course they communicate with us they do it all the time if you pay attention"
I can talk too
animals git scared when backup into a corner
This woman is an amazing teacher!! Its no doubt all animals have emotions. I wish there were schools for all gentle intellectual companions!! I look at these animals like human foreigners whom simply cant speak our language!! Should we treat foreigners as animals because we cant understand their languages?? Same concept!!
"Well , can u do that with dogs next"
wow
Kokocrunch
Yooooooo
Why couldn't it talk
Fuck you
Closest relatives......ahahahahahahaha
"I wonder if Koko knows that she is an animal, not a human"
I thought this was a video about Khloe Kardashian
"Wow, koko got OLD. I remember seeing videos of her as a young gorilla :( time catches up to us all...."
OHHHH LOOK IT'S HARAMBE HUE HUE HUE HUE
Koko has seen 21 Savage in the hills
"It was so sad when they had the video of her reaction when she was told Robin Williams died. She cried all day. 
Tell me animals dont have souls and I'll tell you we are animals."
I love KoKo so much
"Excuse me. My nickname is *koko*. Does that makes me a

Actually it is possible that we can communicate through animals we just have to share our language to them and we can learn all of their language by observing them
A talking animal. I don't believe this has a scientific basis.
first... they need shaved. too hairy.
Yes they can
Kill it before it becomes too smart.
bet he can rap too
Thats not talking.
"*Koko's keeper Francine Patterson was sued by two female employees over allegations of sexual abuse. They stated Patterson threatened to fire them if they didn't show Koko their nipples. When questioned, Patterson claimed it was nothing more than a bonding ritual, one that she participated in many times herself. These employees were hired as research assistants but never did any research, and the conditions they worked in were dangerous and unsanitary. Patterson also preferred to use homeopathy and other quack medical cures instead of providing proper veterinary care. She hired a medical intuitive to realign Koko's chakras and when challenged, claimed it was Koko who asked to be treated with homeopathy. I highly encourage you to read more about this.*"
I KNOW THIS I SAW HER IN A BOOK IN CLASS!!!!! I LOVE HER
Winston and tracer
I love the vid but the last part where you said they were our relatives makes the commentator sound retarded
James franco gonna eventually rescue koko's grandson and name him caesar. This is the beginning of the end for humans
How the fuck did i get heree
"So people believe in Evolution....it took this lady 44 years to teach him to understand a bit of stuff humans do...Think about it,there is a God that created us"

There is a difference between *talking* and *using signs*.. They are two different types of communicating.
Koko is 33yrs older than me
Hai
Aah. So this was the gorilla sheldon talked about when he insutled penny.
Who's here 2019
I read a book about Koko

Eh........ Yes? I'm waiting for what the title claims this is about! So when does she talk or use sign language.. where is that??
If I were there I would ask him what the other animals are saying
One minute your watching splatoon and in a matter of a few seconds im in the weird side of youtube
koko means granny in pedi language ( 1 of South African language)
"Yes they can, if you only listen"
U shud take koko an inetrview
I READ HER IN A BOOK
"What separates humans from apes and all other animals is that we were created in God's image, animals were not. Gorillas are awesome creatures, but God didn't give them God-like thinking capabilities, as we have."
"The LORD made the animals with instinct for eating, procreating , etc.   HE created man to be able to think, reason, analyze, and speak with words. In other words He created man in HIS own image and likeness.  They need to stop trying to mold something it wasn't created for...."
2018?
Seeing him affectionately hugging her is so much soothing...
Pure epicness
Where the evidence
Misleading and thought he could actually ''talk''
It would help if they actually shows us a clip of her talking
incredible!
Rampage confirmed
Koko should be themost smartest in the world
If they keep doing these we can make animals talk pls keep trying so we can do this
"KOKO
COMING TO A THEATER NEAR YOU"
lol I thought it said kobo
I thought black people could always talk
Our closet relative are trees.
War for the planets of the apes is confirmed get your guns ready
I luv koko
Caesar?
"Gorrila: ""hi wadsup?""
Me: *hears only uh ah ah*
Gorrila: ""mhmh"""

Click baaiiittt
Winston inc 2084
"Has this woman not seen war for the planet of the apes. Like jesus, I thought I was watching a preview for a movie."

So shouldn't we give them rights now?
In in love with the KoKo
"Day 48:
I think they started suspecting something..."
"Nah it's probably a bluff. Psychologists are skeptical about this project and still there are debates over this.
And there is the last project with a bonobo which will end the skepticism."
A true bond relationship between animal and man.
I used to watch this alot!! KoKo!!! I love uu
I hope they don't take her away
Why did we not see it talk
she or he
I heard about this at school.
Winston?

Leave the animals alone
He look like Jay-Z
RIP Harambe
I thought Koko was gonna start talking! What the hell? Gayyy
Bill Burr probably watched this video!

1:27 behavior by humans
This video is obviously racist!
Is Koko on Instagram?
AWWWW COCO IS SO CUTE
*-CLICKBAIT-*
Proof of evolution religious people

I read about this and LOVED IT.
Next video: Koko's reaction to Harambe memes
She looks so human....
Harambe!???

Fake
But...we don't get to actually see and hear her talk? :/
"This really prove that the plasticity of the brain is quite impressive. As a student in neurosciences, I am amazed!"
He did not talk
Aww!
Am I the only one who questioned life while watching this???
Wtf is this
you want to know the defining difference between humans and animals and that which makes humans truely unique? Humans are the only animals that can imagine that which does not exists.
Bullshit says koko can talk first off didn't hear the thing say a cam word and sign language is not talkin its sign language talkin is using ur voice ....false
What if it is forced?
0:20 Koko literally raising the middle finger
ask koko about harambe she might give us insights on who harambe is
I think it is just mimicking things it has seen before
"Somehow, I have gotten to the weird side of YouTube."
Did I just watch a 2 minute preview?
Ja und wo hat er jetzt gesprochen ?
"Koko is so cute,omfg"
Im in love with the koko.

"You know, it would've been really nice if you gave us a clip of Koko ACTUALLY talking."
1:26 oh god that's soo badass xD
IT'S SIGN LANGUAGE
Beastiality

Bit of clickbait really thought I was going to hear a conversation
To talk to animals you need to slow things down then add a little bit of frequency of sound boom they talk like humans but the language is different
Did not here her talking though... Poor title but
That beautiful face!!
Only a matter of time be ready
I wish she could become a mommy.  :(
I read a book of KoKo
1:27... YASSSSS Queen Koko the skinny legend sipping her tea ayyyeee
Animals are different but we should give them a chance.they are still alive and its mean to take animals away from what they love like if you agree
and so it begins... #planetoftheapes
Imagine if koko just said  GET ME A BIG MAC MEAL AN A BANNA MILK SHAKE BITCH
Through sign language #StopClickbait
I read koko at school i4s a book

Even tought it is 2018 i come here to cry remembering harambe.
ITS WINSTON
We can talk to animals. It's called body language.
"He does not talk, I watched the whole video. This is a waste of my life"
"Humans are still considered animals in the biology world. Society has this misconception that there is a big line dividing animals and humans but the reality is we are all made from the same components. We are so much like other animals from the bones, mechanisms, and genetic material in our body. If you take a psychology class you'd learn that chemical signals in our brains are what gives us these human characteristics and behaviors. It just really disturbs me when people try to say humans aren't animals. It makes it seem like we're so high above them when we really aren't and we've only had decent civilization on this planet for a couple thousands of years. It wasn't too long ago humans were acting like savage animals killing each other because they didn't believe in the same god."
"Something will always separate us.
Our EGO"
Didn't she die?
Ceasar
If he talks he has a high breed

Gorilla can't actually talk. Go f yourself video.
I thought the video would start like this - Koko: Subscribe to our channel or I will murder you all!
EVOLUTION!
Nothing like  a good biological cousin bonding eh?

Koko didn't talk. Did he ?
Awwwh CoCo is just a sweet heart
the brother of harambe
"This is impressive but keep in mind that this ain't rocket science, we can communicate with primates because we share a common ancestor with them and we share 98% of the same DNA as them"
i didn't hear Coco talk :P
Im in love with the koko
ilove you koko i seen your book im sorry for your lots must be hard
She didn't talk
YES. This is actually perfect! Everyone who has a pet could talk to them maybe in the next 20 years!
But of course she's a prisoner! And an experiment. Humans always trying to get animals to act human- like/put on shows for us like slaves.
Stop eating the animals.
Taking and communication is a different thing
when people will notice that the world is more important instead of earth full with pollution
Ikr
IT'S WINSTON FROM OVERWATCH!!!!!
"Just watch, I'm calling it. Koko is gonna teach other animals to communicate and plot a way to destory the world"
Koko is way more loyal than any of my friends. Ever.
Koko got them insta nails
CLOSE ALL ZOOS AND FREE ALL ANIMALS
did i miss the part where talked?
Hi I am from the future

False alarm guys she cant actually talk she can only do sign language

Now that's a women.
Shove your bible at that

koko doesn't prove that other animals can communicate with humans... we evolved from apes
"You guys are out of your minds. These are wild animals, able to tearyou limb from limb."
Its fucking Winston ma dude
So nowadays sign language is the same as talking. Fucking clickbait is everywhere.
80% of people expected mouth-words
"Kyoko is cute , but Khanzi the bonobo is truly amazing."
Ha he looks like an old grumpy grandpa
Coco son will be named Cesar
Why can't a human fuck with Koko and get some babies...

"Intelligence scale

"I think this is a great achievement, too, but still, HELL WITH THAT! It's in every animal's nature to dominate (you know damn well where I'm going with this). If apes or gorillas got to our level of intelligence and communication, they would become higher. Chimps are already in the stone-age, making tribal groups, gangs, creating tools! Existing with humans will get them to go through eras much faster than we did. It might only take a couple hundred years for them to get where we are. Not only that, but WE ARE NOT A PART OF NATURE! We walk on paved roads and flat surfaces, we use cars and airplanes. Without any of those, we'd be at the bottom of every food chain. Everything is artificial. Apes swing from vines, climb trees, walk on bumpy dirt grounds, without that, THEY CAN STILL MOVE! If they saw eye-level with us, they would be higher, just speakin' realistically here. We're still being killed by animals, today."
Winston is that you?
so it cant actually talk.
Yo just imagine having a great intelligent gorrila ali like koko...
This is so fucking beutiful

"Humans are better, we've got bigger penises!"
"1:55 Actually, our closest relatives are bananas..p"

"it will be depressing if penny dies, koko was already sad that she cant find a mate, and when robin williams died"
"What kind of a fucking retarded question is that?

Can monkeys show emotions to humans OR are there things that we will always have that seperate us????

They are not mutually exclusive... many animals can show their emotions clearly... and all of them remain distinct... not to be confused with humans....

I hate these cunts who ask retarded question is a soothing voice as if they are asking some profound questions"
"They can, I have a lab that I can speak.
When I say wheres your ball she will get it. When i say gimme a kiss she will. And I usually talk to her."
"Here's what i would like to know, it is amazing, but if Koko was taken to a zoo, could koko translate if asked, what the other gorilla's were saying......now that would be amazing"

I clicked on the video to see a fucking oonga boonga talking ape not a damn trailer
"Didn't show him talking, what a sorry video. Typical for PBS."
This is a beautiful creature
Harambe friend
R.I.P Koko yup he died
This is why Science can make the world a better place.
She's friends with Robin William
.... orangutans don't live in argentina or anywhere near there
THIs  bullshit is inspired by the darwinian hoax
"Koko, grab me a couple of brewskis, will ya? Also, phone Dominoes Pizza and order a large Meat Lovers Pizza with an order of garlic bread! Also, mow the lawn, do my laundry, and invest in some stocks. Thanks."
"I wonder what the chances are of me meeting Koko, before I die. Its a dream I've had for many years. What A Beautiful, Fantastic animal God created. How wonderful it would be to sit next to her or even get A hug. And we live so close to one another. I love you Koko. <3"
for the dick who said he hate koko I love you girl I can kiss the best gorilla
there is not only bad in this world but the good side too like this we all can talk it out with others we have to put effort if we dont understand animals dosnt mean we cant communicate there is always a hope waiting to be taken and used for great findings
This is beautiful!
Can Koko be president?...Please?
will she mate
Idk why but koko looks really cute
This means Pure Love....impressed me so much this story...Love u Kokooooo
Koko is Caesars great grandfather.
YOURE TAKING SO LOOOOOONG SAN FRANCISCOOOOOOO
"Koko is self aware, beyond humans, that's isn't suppose to happen? Dolphins are up there too. Naturally  Benevolent  Beings, Humans, apes, most animals in general. Think about it."
she is better than that child killer harambe.
"Love Koko, she's over 45 years old and so smart! All the best to her for the rest of her life! xo"
is koko alive? I asked Siri and she said no
"she doesn't talk, she uses sign language to communicate...."
"I wonder if Koko has a religion. I wonder if Koko can watch videos. I wonder if this means we should give communicating animals rights, since they obviously are conscious. And I wonder if Koko can teach other animals how to communicate, and lastly, does this mean that Winston from Overwatch is possible?"
This is absolutely amazing to me.... I don't understand why but this is just something that makes me a lot more fascinated with the species and the connections between apes humans. Anyone else?
have they thought about adopting a baby ape for Koko...
"Animals are sentient creatures and have, in their own distinctive way, formed communication. That their language is not like us does not want to indicate that animals are without feeling or conscious thought. They are very much aware of themselves and their surroundings. I have to say that I find it very disconcerting that humans still believe that if you do not communicate in vocal wordings... you are stupid. That they act as if animals are some collection of meat with bones and fur and that is it. Animals have brains, and even though their brains differ from ours does not want to say that they do not have feelings, logics and language. If you look and truly observe... you can see that animals have a very rich communication going and a very high awareness of feelings just like us but they express it differently. THAT makes them different but not... dumb or stupid or even less then us."
Ms Patterson did not live and did not let Coco to live either. And Coco did not talk finally after wasting 4 decades of public time on this useless project. Sad.
"""Can animals communicate with humans?"" Literally I have a female chihuahua growling at me from behind my chair. I don't know exactly what she wants but she will do this until she either gets what she wants or gets annoyed at being ignored and goes into a sleep pose where she just stares at me. It's always one of three things. To go out, she wants to play or she wants treats. Come to think of it, sometimes I think she just wants me to go to sleep so she is cozy and warm. IDK.....animals can and try to communicate to humans all the time. Not just pets either."
koko looks stoned 24/7
is koko dead someone told me and im like WHAT REALLY but did he?
koko dont talk..but he can can speak in action
The only difference that remains between humans and animals is the ego
"haven' t seen Koko for a long time, I'm surprised she looks a bit older again.
being the only one in its kind,  do people know what she want for the rest of her life?"
I love how in a documentary they referred to her as an individual because she is more than an animal she is an ambassador for animals and really reveals the shallow understanding that we ourselves have developed about the world around us. If only we opened up our minds to the depths of the culture that animals live and the value in each species and its importance we can go along way. I don't believe personally that we evolved from gorillas but I do believe that every creature human and animal is a part of the whole picture and that we all are co-species. Breaking the language barrier only reveals how much we can relate in positive ways to the world around us.  And how much we can actually learn from our existing counterparts.
Koko your Awesome!!!
Koko is smarter than trump
My dog and two cats understands me and vice versa.
I am sad for koko cause she never got a chance to be a loving mother when she should of got the chance to be.
I want to meet koko
<3 shes cute
"If she's never going to be able to mate and give birth to her own, why not bring an orphan baby for her to raise???  She wants to be a mommy.  How else to see if she'll teach what she's learned...before she's too old."
I want Koko to be the president of the US rather than Donald Trump.
Teach her how to say dicks out for Harambe
Koko is harambe's son.
i thought she died tf.
The comment section is proof that Koko is more intelligent than half the human population.... if not more.
DICKS OUT FOR HARAMBE
I would ask koko to take her dick out for harambe
"""one of the most richest city in the us"" as a dirt bike and shit car rolls by"
where can i see the movie?
SPREAD THE WORD ABOUT KOKO #KOKOTHEGORILLA
"penny was a bombshell, still is. GIGGITY"
"Animals are smart just like human, because koko doesn't have a kid, I hope other organizations will keep teaching animals to communicate with humans"
Where can I watch this!
wat if she had a baby n tought it sign language
I remember Koko! She met Robin Williams! ....I also remember when her cat died. it was sad. Koko is such a sweet girl. I wish I could meet her.
"Michael devil, Koko good"
0:19  I wonder if they ever painted her fingernails.  She may like how it looks.  : )P
"One day another species will look us in the eye, and say what the fuck is up with you guys. I mean, really why are you guys so fucking fucked up? To which we will reply.........holy shit."
When I heard about koko talking I thought she could vocally speak instead of just signing like a person
Shot that fuxking koka
#savekoko!
love koko
Like this commnt if Koko is a better mother than Harambe-Killer Michelle Gregg
IT'S NOT TALKING WTF.
My dog communicates really well
Of course animals can talk to us IF we listen. Why do some people need to question that over 44 years?
"I LOVE THIS!  I've seen (and commented on) every Koko video over the past several years.  Finally, the first special about her since 1999 (except for the news she made when Robin Williams killed himself)."
why isnt koko a movie star? her story needs to get out especially considering recent events with the zoo.
Is he still alive? I have searched and searched but havent found anything.
how old is koko?
Can't wait!  Can't wait!  Can't wait!  I have been following Koko for decades.
Very cool
"Gracious, the point is that Koko, with her fondness for kittens, her other preferences and relationships, is happy to communicate with Penny.   "
"I never had that Dr. Dolittle moment as a child. I just enjoyed the company of my pets and recognized them for what they were, animals.

Also, I didn't here him/her say a word. Click-bait much?"
