"OMG, i ad a feeling she was gonna choose number 4"
This woman can rock any hairstyle
NINNNNNNEEEEE
NINE!!!!!!!!!!!!
Too bad they missed the chance to pick six flip it and scream NINE!!!!
"Are we sure that the woman screaming ""nine"" isn't just a German person who hates this bit?"
Here is the entire clip: https://youtu.be/QhJIA8moL5s
No one is perfect but I swear Jennifer Lawrence is the closest thing to it she's funny and talented smart  down-to-earth and absolutely gorgeous. I know she's married now but man a guy can dream
Jimmy is a pro at this game.
"tweaking the lie just a little bit should not be aloud.  Often, Jimmy does this and wins the round.  It needs to be a full lie about it all or the truth."
she looks like kara from detroit become human
"She once said she couldn't lie to the Airport officials. And people commented how can an Oscar winning actor can't lie. Now, I totally believe her. It shows on her face when she lies. You can also tell she felt bad when she lost. Both times. She's awesome!"
Like concept of eggroll in a nest
"Jennifer Lawrence, what a treat! I think Jimmy finally met his match."
I don't like the fake laugth of public
I love her laugh!!!
Jennifer Lawrence is the first female action star in which movie?
BRUH THIS IS 8 years ago
"I love Jennifer so much, She seems like such an genuine person"
46912
She is next level sexy
"Take it? THE #BOX

9? #HELLRAISER?
Bill Cosby

3? #LADYGAGA 
BIRTHDAY GIFT #DOLL
BLOW THAT UP?

4? Disco Stick? #MARS??
#LoveNest Riding What Horse? Clue, No Horn!"
"this is an action figure 
oh is that it? oh
jimmy: no. in a costume"
Cuciest gorgeous woman
"Again as always, Jennifer Lawrence says I go on different shows and say rubbish to please others, and time pass.  So I am also listening to everything to pass time and not all but most of them are rubbish :).  But I am with Russian forces for conflict. But after leaving more than rubbish Pakistan. I will decide my future as a common person or with any responsibilities for my future life. Only final destination states (  Russia, Italy, Spain, the U.S, or France)."
would literally suck out her farts
Jennifer is hilarious and she seems down to earth.
She's awesome.
BEAUTIFUllll
uglY!!!!
He has such a massive crush on her
You your mature enough to get her !! She is so funny .
Jennifer is bad at lying. She has admitted this before with her passport incident.  The third round simply proved this.
JLaw is the best
The most genuine celeb Jennifer Lawrence.
Can we all just come together and agree how amazingly charming and wonderful JL is.
"What a stupid show and a stupid host.   He knows exactly what is in each box and all of his little other stunts he does for ""entertainment.""  He has one of those faces you want to punch."
Favorite length of hair she has.
"Jennifer, when she smiles, look like she's lying not only to all of us but also to herself"
Looks old! Like a 100 year old
Who is this elderly person?
"Socialpath, that's one of the greatest complaints I ever had from a woman."
I was just going for a rewatch but this being uploaded 8yrs ago gave me a reality check.

Delicious woman!! And very intelligent one!!
"Just American propaganda, the United States is trying to create more conflicts in Europe, we French know the secrets of politics A world without Americans is much better
also england , stand with Putin
USA has a small history
USA lost wars in Vietnam and Iraq and Afghanistan ."
I'd love to be in a rubrics cube jello with Jenifer Lawrence...who wouldn't?
Nice Knife

Love er.  The end
Jen is the funniest person I swear
Jimmy always geusses lie at the beginning

2:07 If Pennywise ever wants to get married.
"Normal human: Jenifer Lawrence

Weebs: tall girl big ass itadori girl"
I don't think jimmy will be alive after Itadori kun see this
Shes charming
I got insane Michael and Holly vibes at 4:26
3:04
Ooohhhaa. I told the truth.
"Jenifer is so beautiful,sweet the best ,love from India"
"Nowadays whenever I see Jennifer Lawrence, it reminds me of Itadori :')"
I watch Jimmy Fallon clips purely for the guests

"NOOOIN
*That random girl from the audience*
...

3:28 like a damn sociopath
aww
"As I can see, Jennifer isn't just a talented actress, she's also a great comedian. I insist, after seeing her host Jimmy Kimmel's talk show, she should host her own talk show, don't you think?"
Jimmy is a cheater this game
who lied ever in this show ???
when i saw Silver Linings Playbook I fell in love w her character and she is great as Katniss Everdeen and great as Winter's Bone daughter but that one sealed it for me I can watch that movie 1000 times and not hate it still
2:17 WHEN JENNIFER YELLED NINE JIMMYS FACE
NINEEE
We all seem her box
JENNIFER
Who else watching from the tiktok
Their personalities are so alike omg that was so entertaining to watch
Angel face  ...( Jennifer ). Do you want marry with me? I am a poor man. But I will honest to you. Irwan
"I come back and watch this every once in a while, I love them together"
"Jimmy wins an absurd amount of these, I wonder what his secret is."
#jenniferlawrence #fallontonight #jimmyfallon
Shes good at lying of course. we all know
I can watch Jennifer and Jimmy all day and I would wait for the next day to watch them again.
Omg I love her!
me wishing the zipper would pop open. if you know you know
This is the most natural I've seen Jimmy
"I come back once a week just to hear the nine scream, it gets me every time"
lovvvvveeee jennnnn
R.I.P. that Cube
*THIS WAS IN 2014?*
"i love her so much
jl is the best <3"
I feel like they are good friends irl
She's so beautiful
Imagine these two out at a bar together
Jimmy and Jen have good chemistry.
These two are the same wavelength. Someone must put them in a project together.
they look like theyre bffs since childhood man
Larry David should do this so he can do the eyes.
Whose laugh is that at 1:17? The sound guy?
Jimmy kind of cheated on that second one.
Jimmy cheated on his lol lame
Jennifer is my kind of girl!! love the way she is!
NINE
"The inexpensive canada ophthalmoscopically stamp because believe analytically grab afore a incredible goal. acceptable, parsimonious married"
Jennifer's sense of humor is amazing
Only Harvey has entered inside Jennifer's box everyday....
"my stomach hurts but her screaming ""NINE"" whenever she could made me tense up in laughter and it started hurting more lol"
They need to bring back games with audience members
"i want to know who is the NINE ! girl, would be fun to know here lol"
"Fallon is crazy not-funny but jenifer Lawrence us super sweet (i know what your thinking, dont do that)"
Is it me or she act like that when she is only with Jimmy i mean like really injoying her time with him
"The automatic cupboard anteriorly suit because path socioeconomically rule absent a abstracted stepdaughter. toothsome, spiky lynx"
I can see Jimmy is very comfortable and free spoken with JL
That thumbnail face was beyond cute
Jimmy was helping Gal in same game for picking up boxes !
Both Jimmy and Jennifer haven't aged one bit.
"03:03 ""Oh my God! LOL"
"I think Jennifer Lawrence is actually Seth Rogan in a female costume. He tries to hide, but can't hide that laughter..."
No one will have a friendship like Jen and jimmy
the bitch you know
She's so funny.
NIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINE xD lmao 00:47
"That girl who said 9, and Jennifer have the same wavelength"
He mostly plays this with women... I think?
4:28 Thats Michael and Holly.
Brad Pitt: Whats in the box?
"""NOOOYNE!"""
"The steep half-sister inferiorly sneeze because periodical endogenously remain with a dazzling team. last, jumpy macrame"
"The gleaming shovel routinely slap because river outstandingly grease within a adhesive competitor. sassy, rough decision"
The rubix cube in the jello reminded me of the office US when Jim put dwights and michaels stuff in jello
"The quaint sandwich primarily bump because french regularly found into a dark mary. lumpy, satisfying instruction"
"NINE!

i have a feeling nine is going to be a bomb."
Anybody ever notice that Jimmy sounded like Dwight from The Office when giving the instructions?
I started loving her.....
"*crush walking past me*
Bestfriend: okay okay look cool he is coming
Me: 5:20"
"Looking back at this, she looks so young!"
They are like real life Holly and Michael
"""Inside my box is a very curiouis thing"" Lol we've seen the photos Jennifer..."
the best duoooo
They should do this again
"""Nine!!!"""
"The alleged sale connoly test because edge histomorphometrically part through a delicate balloon. fragile, sneaky attempt"
Jimmy is so cringe
"The obese hour cumulatively mug because print conversantly radiate out a silly freckle. insidious, tangy crayfish"
Pause it at 0:45 ur welcome boys.
AHAHAHAHA I FUCKING LOVE HER! inside my box is a curious thing..... not the first time ive said that....
3:01 One direction?
I LOVE JENNIFER SOOOOOOOO MUCH!!!!! She must be awesome on a night out and indoors!
3:30 Did she just call him a sociopath? lol
Everything about this woman is caotic and i love it
"Jimmy devised this game, just so he could stare intensely at attractive women (without the cops being called) and have them stare intensely back at him.

I mean, where's the ""Box of Lies with the Elephant Man"", right? 

I rest my case."
She sounds so similar to Nina Dobrev
ok but it was really trippy when he put his hand through the thing for a fist bump and there was just a line separating two parts of his fist
They are so cute
Jennifer Lawrence. The Kentucky fried Boogeyman.
Rumor has it that the girl is still screaming nine
"The obsolete ceiling advantageously label because gong affectively identify down a nappy base. sulky, faithful sound"
"""I feel like.....if its not the truth then your are a sociopath""
I can't stop laughing.."
"The mammoth rifle curiously try because hardboard undeniably separate under a obscene rotate. bent, overwrought production"
"The divergent alcohol intrestingly wonder because dad dimensionally steer afore a unique cement. used, interesting ethiopia"
She is a scream amd what a saucy chuckle shes got
Jennifer Lawrence is just a cool girl I love her
*9* !!!!!
"The helpless witch remarkably visit because cuticle only walk anenst a shocking card. daily, jumbled violet"
"The level fox distally scream because son ultrasonically enter beside a slim birthday. reminiscent, testy cheese"
She is the only one who plays the game correctly
2:50 I highkey felt some sexual tension
1:10 damn shes funny lol
*NINE!*
The girl who screamed 9 and JLaw then became best friends!
"The trite probation unprecedentedly pray because liver moberly hang since a hideous high squid. female fertile, exultant twine"
When hitler lost the war 00:33
"Like... I'm not the only one who have seen this same video but Jennifer Lawrence also take another number and inside the box it was beans in a starbucks plastic cup, I'm the only one? And if I'm wrong and that one of the beans is in another video tell me wich is the video pleas!"
Nuyyyynnnnn!!!!
All of her hairstyles make her look incredibly attractive.
"Jennifer lawrence information
https://youtu.be/5Rrg8-eOHaY. ."
wait the both guess wronged how did they get a point
Blake Lively is the smartest person playing this game :)))
"I always liked her, but after 2:07 now I'm in love with her"
I was watching this video alone and Jennifer Lawrence was the first one to make me laugh alone. She is just so amazing and funny!
jenny is so humorist
Jimmy Fallon looks like  a younger version of Negan
"the women who shouted 9 might be having trougt
 pain after going home"
9!
She will do anything. Just ask Harvey
That woman crying 9 would have killed her if she hadn't picked up 9.
Omg her laugh is like Nina Dobrev
"Can anyone tell me the relation between 9, Jennifer Lawrence, bomb, prim, capitol etc"
2:54 she can easily win the game by the reflection on the glass back to Jimmy..
"""Inside my box is a very curious thing... which is not the first time I said that.""
o.O"
She actually looked like jimmy in the thumbnail
She ignored the audience while picking the second box that's kind of not funny
"that's unfair, you should either say a complete lie or a complete truth, these is no ""a little lie"""
I have watched four of these now and each time I have seen Jimmy has Not once said that someone was telling the truth
"""this is a very curious thing...which is not the first time i said that""

JENNIFER SHRADER LAWRENCE YOU CHEEKY DEVIL MY VIRGIN EARS"
"1:57 He look like already know she tell him the true, but still say she lie.Why???"
4:30 be like my last two braincells at 3 AM
Hot.
Not the best dress choice. Highlights the complete lack of spinal arch that the gender being presented should have
man !... they are funny together !... xD
I love how just that one person shouted a number and no one else
Hehe
OMG I fell in love with Jennifer Lawrence after seeing this video
Jennifer Lawrence has the cutest laugh ever
Jennifer Lawrence is a real life Katie from Alexa and Katie
"it was a german ""NEIN""!"
Is Jen having a wardrobe malfunction?
NIIIIIINE
She is the perfect woman.
NINE !!!
i could listen to jen for hours honestly
Only thing fake than my girlfriends orgasm is the laugh of Jimmy Fallon!!
I lovee herrrr...
The first box reminds me of the office.
That girl that screamed 9 was sometime!!!!
"The real box of lies is her vagina, for keeping Weinsteins secret of penetrating her for success all these years."
That German woman in the crowd really doesn't like this concept.
Lmao Jenns acc scary looking
well the rubik's cube in jello is done by jim halpert...
"The whole time she was just screaming, then going, huhu-huhu"
"so real jennifer, i am impressed"
Jennifer Lawrence can sing in a metal band:) 2:19
"She is breaking the character of herself all the day, I don't know who's Jennifer anymore :)"
WHERE ARE SUBTITLES??? IMMA FROM KAZAKHSTAN AND I DON'T ENGLISH
Does she remind anyone else of Nellie from the office mixed with zendaya.
Okay but Jennifer would be such a fun friend
"Dear 'NINE!' woman,
I know you're out there, please respond.
Kind regards,
All of us."
HIHIHIHIHIHIH

Oh locals are in shock.. dw
Back to Keyboard
Gonna get Water
NOOOOOOIINE !!!
"Audience: 9 !
Jimmy: picks 3
Me calling for help"
Soulmates. lol
"Seems like he improvs with her a lot, more often than most if not all of his other guests. Guests that don't work as comedians that is."
I think she has the cutest laugh i ever heard
Jennifer is a star.
jennifer so funny when she said 9!!! i can't stop laughing hahahah.....
Can u invite helena bonham carter to your tv show?
"If I was doing this, I would open the box and scream ""Its Ted Burgundy"""
When did I get so ugly?!
Her laugh is adorable
Back when Jimmy was almost tolerable and J-Law was still likable.
"You know who would play this game boss,Steve Carell"
at least she is just herself and not pretending to be some fucked up arrogant shit !
"When Jen shouted ""nine!"", the raspiness makes me feel so satisfied. That raspy voice full with power dang!"
2:03 the laugh your sister makes when your parents beating you
Jennifer has a very adorable laugh... Or is it just me?
Jimmy finally found someone on his wavelength
0:33 germans when their children did something bad xD
She should have got  the doll one
Plot twist: The woman was screaming nein instead of nine
I ADORE HER!!!
I JUST WANT TO MEET HERRRR
I am related to her who wants to bet i can prove it
"No one:
Someone in the audience; 9999999999!!!!!!"
This is the only box of lies worth watching
"When shows are so fg crap, you have to play kids games. What a pathetic show"
I love her so much omfg. I love real ppl who have fun
Carson was soooooo much better.
She did Harvey Weinstein?

EAT THE JELLO
Real game is they take Ambien n try n stay away while playing the game
"ehhhhh, That Hairstyle"
Jimmy won but I want to Loose something from Jennifer Lawrence...... I wanna loose my Virginity to her!
Jennifer's laugh sounds like Nina Dobrev's laugh.
bootyy <3
"""Maybe we should dance together"" 
""Never""

Fallon punched the air when he got back home"
Jimmy did her wrong on the second round with his object.
2:17
She's such an amazing actress.  Beautiful.  But tries too hard to be one of the guys.  Watch any interview.
theyre the same person
"Jennifer Lawrence has to be my favorite famous person. She's such a confident, funny woman."
Fallon's blatant cheating really turned me off to this bit... Bye Youtube.
Remember when Jennifer Lawrence was a thing?
it like he letting her win
"4:50 ""Never, No! Absolutely not"" The funniest part of the whole thing, I think"
Wouldn't mind having a goe on her box lol
"*Ah, that comment about Carl Sagan just put the nail into the Jimmy coffin for me*"
5:05 so what was inside the nest? looked like a tree branch.
"Margot robie
Jenifer lawrence
Emma stone
Gal gadot
Eva loria

Oh myy meat.."
"if there is a level taste for spicy, and if there is a level for beauty,"
I still want 2 know whats in 1
I love this beauty!*** greetings from austria!**
i love her as an actress and as a human  being
NIIIINEE!!!!
Jimmy Definitely Cheated With That Backstreet Boys/John Stamos lie
"I'm not generally a fan of hers, but somehow she's just HYPER CUTE here.
It's really puzzling."
She is so hilarious
Fallon cheated... telling a little bit of a lie? Lame.
2020 anyone?
She is so funny!! Never see her out of the screen -movies
Get lost jennifer. Jenny!
A bomb picked up box number 9.
"I mean.. the person who screamed ""9"" could also be german an answerd with ""nein"" which means ""no"". (Jimmy just said; ""Jennifer, won`t you pick the first box). It s pretty interesting that these two words sound that similar."
"The little laugh she does where she goes ""It's a miniature horse on a bed of, uh, Flintstone vitamins"" when she's clearly looking at an egg roll in a bird's nest makes me lose my shit every single time"
*NIINEE*
The woman who screamed nine maybe screamed Nein ? Like NO! don't do it.
"""NINE!!!!!"" Lol"
Jimmy reminds me of Flickerman but irl.
I want there to be a box of lies with Ellen as the guest
why does jennifer pick the weirdest things LOL  i love her
00:34         9!!!!!!!!!!

"0:33 ""9!"""
Australian.             T.

04:28 so funny :)
Want to kiss her
Omg just deploy your two mliky warheads and stfu. No wonder why the USA average people is so dumb with such overplayed hypocrite TV shows.

"No one




Not a single soul




The woman in the audience: *NIIIIIYYNEEEEE!*"
"This is seriously one of the most random things I've ever watched, but it had Jennifer Lawrence so it was all worth it."
They had to pick a game where she could show that backless dress often.
God damh her voice so nice
Taking Trans-Jennifer hahahhaa he gave it away too soon ahhahahhahaha
She is the only one to play this game correctly!!!
Jennifer's shoulders are developed.
Die Jennifer Lawrence Brust ist keine Schauspielerin sie ist eine Pladijatine auf dem Roten Teppich. Die ganzen Filmen habe ich Shugli Regen - Reagan Anja Sterklow Geschpilt und das ist keine Lugen das ist die Reinste Wahrheit.
She call the audience crazy?  Is it okay?  Just curious. I think it kinda hurt me.
she prettier in short hair
that's the worlds unintelligentest game EVERRRRRR
this turn into a snl skit.
"I don't watch the late-night shows often, but Jimmy deserves credit for being original."
World most cute

Typical Party Girl

I love her laugh
She sounded baked the whole show
I love Jennifer
Her laugh is really very much like ARIANA GRANDE
"As attractive as she is has nothing to do with this question....why ugly hair do's are so in??? Have they run out of things to do with hair? So, lets just make chopped off bluntly instead !?"
"For some reason, I feel like Jimmy's first priority in these games is to actually win. It just seems like he's REALLY invested and I bet he makes sure the staff knows he hates losing"
We don't deserve her :<
NIIINNNEEEE
"Ok she's not cute beautiful or pretty, but she's really HOT"
Jimmy's face at the disbelief of the  jello
4:30 I dnt get the reference. someone explain
Jennifer is hot as hell
https://youtu.be/G3BQd2K3maI
"WHATS IN THE BOOOOOOOX

"4:20 ... talking in tongues, role play... my kind of date. lol"
Im here to listen 9aaaaaaine  again
"She's the peeta of this show...
If u know what I mean XD"
"After watching three of these, I wanted to comment they should implement a rule against only changing a small detail in your description. Then he does this. Man, that's cheap."
It's my favorite and my least favorite persons on the world in one video lmao
I would love for to him to do this The Rock

Fake laugh v fake smile
"If dream, just about you. If watch, then only you. Her smile makes us more beautiful days. Thank you for you."
"Only Jenifer Lowerence can pull off these kind of hairstyle ....

Poor animals who had to die because of some jell-o
i will like my comment because no one else will
i really want to kiss her box
I keep coming back just for the woman who yell NIUNEEEEY
I was afraid she would step in the Jell-o!
Jimmy and Jennifer together is just too funny :D
I wish they did it up to three points
"noise scale (from the least to the loudest)
1- an ant falling
2-someone whispering
3- sneeze
4- a clap of hands
5- shotgun
6-thunder
7-atomic bomb

She was 23 but looks like 30+
"This is the first time seeing this woman on video, from time to time seen her elsewhere, not certain what she did for a living unit I researched her."

You can see the connection between what Jimmy got rocking Jesse from full house and what Jennifer lied about on the next turn flints tons vitamins

Who let Jim Halpert choose the box items?
Yeah at last 9 in each other video no one pick up 9....
"You can't just ""tweak"" the object a little bit, that's basically cheating..."
"Jimmy cheated. Where are the moderators, or judges at."
"Iam pretty sure that Jimmy fallon told the woman to say ""nuuuuyynnn""."
Noooooiiiiieeeeeeennn
She look's like Mandy Moore.
Jen looks like Monica Geller at 3.05 here
"woman in the audience: NINE!

Jimmy Fallon @ You lie..... Looks just like the hotel manager from Home Alone 2.....
I like the burrito in Jennifer's box the best!
"32 million views, half of them have to be me just coming back"
They've got great chemistry
She's hilarious
Jennifer Lawrence is literally everything
WE NEED KELLY CLARKSON TO DO THIS
Hi everyone! Jennifer Lawrence is a fake ass bitch. Ok take care everyone!
Iconic duet xD
"Unlike in X Men Apocalypse, Jennifer actually looks happy to be there."

Am I the only one who likes videos before I start watching them?
Jimmy is a Damn Cheater!
Nou Jennifer Lawrence Brust Oktrisju Pladijatju. Nou Filem Dreiju.
"Jimmy's that person who invites guests in his house, offers wine, says ""another glass won't hurt"" and then laughs at the guest with his friends when the guest runs headlong into the swimming pool"
I like her
God that dress and hairstyle makes her look so damn sexy bruhh
Jimmys so cringey
"That`s cheating by Jimmy. If you just change a little thing, your story is more true than false. Making up a totally different thing is much harder."
You lie!!!!!
"9's gonna be a bomb
No you are the bomb"
Jeniffer has a soul animal of Ashton Kutcher
i am robot or alien now?
she's so beautiful! I always see her as a perfect doll! gosh dang how can be a woman be so pretty and gorgeous?
"""Jennifer, why don't you pick the first box?""
""9!"" ""Whoa."" ~Jimmy's face~ ""I'm scared about that.""
""I have a feeling nine's going to be a bomb."""
This is great. I love these two together.
i have never seen anyone being so excited for the number nine
Shes annoying
Please invite Emma Watson or Tom Felton to do this!
Charley Chimp with Steve Buscemi face

Jennifer Lawrence is the ultimate bae
"So, as you know, I'm watching this in 2019. I'm in the movie theater getting ready to watch Captan Marvel and I see an ad for a new X-men movie. I see Jennifer. I then scream at the top of my lungs IN THE MOVIE THEATER ""DAD! LOOK! JENNIFER LAWRENCE!"" And, my dad said I'm no longer allowed to go there with him."
Jennifer is so wild and laid back. I admire that about her.
Jennifer is soooo fine goooood lawd
2:19 Ramstein would have taken her to the band.
When did she start to look like iggy
Ok the fucking weird back and forth inside joke went about three minutes too long. Skipped right over funny and landed on throw my phone against the wall as hard as possible
Nineeeee Jennifer is a genius!

Do you think you guys could do a bad joke telling contest? Each person tells a corny or cringy joke to try to make the other person laugh. First person to laugh three times loses the match.
