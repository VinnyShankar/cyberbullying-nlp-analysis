"So, if I'm 15 ft from the Pole and I just sit there, the day will be as long as if I were at the equator. But if I get up, i can walk around the world, maybe several times, in one day."
Maybe the earth is flat then
That vest is awesome
"Sir, this is a Wendys."
Similar question is which way is east?
"You ruined your own credibility becoming political Neil. 

Just stick to the science you know.

It's actually entirely dependent on what time they feel comfortable using but usually they go with the sweedish time zone if I'm not mistaken
This dude is so white
Whatever your watch says
Same time as Greenwich?
GMT?
Ask a pole !
Timeless
GMT London is standard

All at once. One step in any direction would put you in that time zone.
"Who cares, it's too damn cold there anyway."
Ask Santa!
That's how you can do time travel!
It's either daytime or nighttime depending on the date.
What's happening now ks happening at the same time as everything else that's happening in the universe
Yesterday at the north.  Tomorrow on the south
Its the same time as it is everywhere
"""Not that anybody asked but lines of lon-""

Any time you want
Would you just shut up and bowl!
I love you style and delivery!!
Time doesn't exist at the poles
It should be UTC.
its kinda interesting... on that thought... if you draw a walkable circle around the pole and walk through it it means you walk through time zones by steps...
"No one ever asked you anything, Neil. You just really like to hear your own voice."
Tyson is my GOD!
Get me a vest like his!!
"It won't matter because it's awful there, and I like to stay warm."
It depends on how the poles identify themselves
"I am going to say that time is relative, quite literally in this case. 
Each line of longitude is a plus or minus to the reference point. Once you get to absolute north, there is no plus or minus. 
Therefore, I suggest that it is GMT, UTC, Zulu, or whatever it is called in your part of the world."
"Good question. The answer is, a sun dial at the pole would not tell you much because the Sun is at the same azimuth all day!"
Shouldn't it be the same time everywhere if not some people are in the past and some are in the future
0:00 and 24:00
Zero hours.
Nobody has ever asked
"If all longitudes denote time, then at the North and South Poles, the concept of time becomes undefined or arbitrary since all longitudes converge at those points. There wouldn't be a specific time associated with them."
156:00
"Love the vest my friend,,I have a question,,,can a black hole suck in another black hole,an if so what would happen"
Time to make the donuts or Miller time
It s   the same as the prime meridian in Greenwich england. True
Well..... What time is it!?!!?!
Its now
must be why nobody remembers to turn the lights on ( or off ) up there for normal 24 hour days.
"Nah bro at the ""what time is it"" you missed the vsause song"
I would suggest it's midnight 24/7.
Geek
1pm yesterday
Is it midnight in the winter and noon in the Summer?
I dunno. ASK A POLOCK.
The poles matches any Time zone. So we can pick whatever we want. I'm quite sure the GMT is the convention.
A meeting time.
UTC aka Greenwich Mean Time
Obviously nothing to figure out here but i guess it's a fun stoner/shower thought
"Time measurement works the same way. If u stand on the pole facing 0L and fix your gaze straight ahead, it will take 24 hours of Earth spin to get back to the same direction where you started"
"0 degrees, London time I guess"
"Dammit, going to have this stuck in my head all day now."
"Technically speaking, your location will never be AT the pole if you consider your location as a point of infinitely small size. Sure, you can walk in a circle and go through all the time zones but to remain healthy, I suggest you pick one and stick with it."
At the North Pole it's always Christmas.  At the south Pole it's called Penguin Time
Greenwich Meantime?
Wouldn't it be UTC?
"No time zone has been assigned to the North Pole, so any time can be used as the local time."
Depends on which direction you are facing and what time it is there
"Demark time? No, they demark time difference."
At the poles atleast in the military we use zulu time.
Hammer Time!
"simple, just look at your watch and boom you have the time."
I would say that the time observed would be dependent on which direction you were facing.
At poles there is just a second or it's just existence.
"Aging factor is same for humans all over the world 
This depends upon the space time bend caused by the sun and the earth"
What time is it when people are in space?
My guess would be GMT at the poles.
Easy the Greenwich

Here and now...and now now now now
This guy has become very annoying.
"It is Zulu time, which I think is the same as GMT. Anyway, it was agreed that the time at the poles would always be Zulu time."
Time is a unit of measure it actually is only exists in our minds
"The lines do not represent time itself,they only show reference to time."
GMT
I'm a geography guy and I never realized that fact.  How embarrassing!
"Nice one , the answer should be the GMT

the GMT time is always same everywhere on earth irrespective of timezones"
Errytime
"""what time is it at the pole""  yes!"
Its all times and no specific time.  More specifically if you are there its the time that your most recent reference is.  Yes?
I will let you know when I am at the pole
"They go by Zulu time a military standard time universally recognized.

I thought this guy was smart at one point..."
Ist easy: There is no Hour at all anymore. There is day or night. Or it is dusk or dawn. No Hour is left there between.
"Oh my, you are blowing flat earthers mind."
"I guess there are conventions that answer this question. If it were up to me: the geographic North Pole is at the bottom of the sea, so nobody lives there that is interested in what time it is overthere. South Pole: I guess there are only a few scientific settlements at the coast in a specific time zone. The real geographic South Pole is uninhabited and I presume that it has no value to anybody - so most likely nobody is interested in what time it is overthere."
"It's always ""now"" at the poles. :-)"
00:00
It's Zulu Time of course!
Its Pole Time...
Its where time first began and where it ends.

"Linear time doesn't make sense at the Poles. It doesn't really make sense how we use it overall either, but it is garbage at the Poles."
"I think the time at the pole is conventional. The night lasts six months there. How can we say tha the concept of time is not conventional? If the art would never had turned on itself we would never have been capable to define the concepts of hour, minutes, days, months or years."
I didn't ask and i don't care..im not ever going to either pole.

This one would depend on latitude of where you are at that point so each point would hit midnight or noon multiple times a day if each time zone is divided by the longitude of each time zone could be entirely wrong or time at that point time does not exist that is what comes to mind.
Time to get a watch!
Time to ascend
Hammer Time! Can't touch dis!
The movie Santas Slay beat you to this question. All time zone converge at the North Pole so Xmas is over when I say it's over.
"I think, the poles are defined as being GMT."
It's night for sure

About that time.
Zulu
Time does not exist except as a dimension or wave form
It's o'clock LOL
"Time is an illusion Neil, duh!"
You could just arbitrarily assign time zones of other places to the poles innit?

"Time has speed limits that goes from zero to approaching the speed of light. That means that TIME AND THE SPEED OF LIGHT ARE TWO DIFFERENT AND SEPARATE ENTITIES, which  in turn opens up a modern door into physics. TWO UNIVERSES!

But that's just the first step. The above suggests TWO UNIVERSES.  The one of  time , matter, etc. And the other a universe of speed of light photons. 
Next the eternal photon universe was the first singularity that created all, through photons create electron positron pairs... next ..."
Daytime or nighttime

UTC time zone
"At the Poles, time doesn't exist, there is only one time and it's called ""NOW"".
It's simply timeless at the Poles.
when all the time zones converge, there is only one moment therefore timeless."
4:20. Especially before this particular video was filmed.
"Well, there is an answer. Explorers, I believe, kept their watches set to the time zone of the original base camp."
"Obviously, it would be now"
Does this explain how Santa Claus is able to deliver all of his presents in one night?

Theres 2 times in poles. Its either day or night
Easy 12 noon
00:00.
Same time as prime meridian.
There is no specific time zone at the poles.
Multiple time zones?
Gmt?
It's either day time or night time.
"It's ""now"""
I still don't understand why there is a time zone. What's wrong with that if the sun rises at 12 am. Office hours are from 5 to 1 or whatever. At least we could have the same time on earth. Same clock setting that's way better.
Wait! So what time is it ?
"Neil you are not a very smart person ,"
"This dude is so kind he apologizes for being random, interrupting our 'important time'. Thanks Neil!"
UTC!
I'm glad I'm lazy and have all the time in the world to think about this question
2pm on a Saturday. Best time of the week.
At research stations in Antarctica they use Universal Time (UTC) or the time zones of the researchers home countries.
"At the poles, all lines of longitude converge, and technically any time zone can be applied. But, some research stations and bases at the poles choose to use the time zone of their home country or the time zone that's most convenient for their operations. For example, the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station typically uses New Zealand Standard Time (NZST) or New Zealand Daylight Time (NZDT), as it is supplied from Christchurch, New Zealand."
Time at the poles don't exist
"I don't know what time it is at the pole, but if I plan it right, I could take all day too walk a circle a few feet from the pole and it will always be happy hour."
Like that key and peele sketch
It's now or never
"Its noon, cuz the sun is always overhead."
The same time in all time zones
"UTC. Universal Time Coordinate, formerly known as Greenwich Mean Time. What else?"
the time you want
Yet Santa is never late
"in summer at the north pole all day it is ""day"" time, i reckon you can guess what time it is at the south pole on the same day."
you rock
Only Santa knows the true secret.
it's all-time at the pole.
BROO THIS MESSED ME UP I DONT NEED SLEEP I NEED ANSWERS
"Time gets absorbed into the poles, like the Northern and Southern lights...swirling in."

Yes
"GMT.

"Well, now I need to know!"
"I wonder if dude is ever able sleep. I mean, it looks like his brain is always working, trying to make sense of every thing he has seen since ....."
Greenwich mean time.
Just destroyed my brain.
What time is it exactly on the line that divides two adjacent time zones? That's still the same problem.
Midnight at the north pole and noon at the south
IT'S POLAR TIME
Is it greenwich mean time? Good question!
Too early in the morning to think about that
Love your vest!
Time to get some warm clothes.
12:00 am/pm
Works if the earth was layer out flat- flat earth globe would be confusing for time at poles
GMT 0
Thats why santa is that old !
Time stops for 6 months
DAMN YOU NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON!!!  My brain hurts now.
Zero o'clock?
Prime meridian
its all the time at the poles
The good thing about hanging with Neil. You learn stuff you would have never known to ask about in the first place.
UTC time?
Dude that was actually mindblowing for a second like yo for real what is the time at the poles.
Im high and this blew my mind
"At the poles it is always the same time, time fore hot chocolate!"
South Pole is on New Zealand time.
Is it Morning  time ik they have longer days and longer nights
"9AM during spring and summer, and 9pm during fall and winter. Just guessing"
Maybe there's no time at the North Pole snd thats why Santa can get all his deliveries done
"Been there, done that!"
Well just look at a map of the lines and which ever little pie slice your in between the lines is your time zone
Answer the frikin question!!! What time IS it at the poles!?
i will just google it
"4:16 am,"
"if you run in a circle around the pole, like 5 meters away from it, you time travel"
It would be 12pm or 12am all day depending on the time of year.
Time you got a real job
There are other times here on earth that are not accounted for and there are dimensions that are there  and are also not accounted for . And this leads into the quantum physics of time and reality of times  that go into bend of another place in the  universe. Or something like that. Time is bigger than the Milky Way . Beam me up Scottie. Convert or converse time with another angle of approach in frequencies  insepartions  of ???????????. There are many.
"Make you say, hmm?"
NOAT & SOAT
NOW.
There is no time zone there.
It would always be 12am which is the start of each day. Not that hard to figure that one out.
Thats why they say there is no time in Antarctica and the government is hiding secrets about that place
so there should be a point where you can walk say a 5 min and go either 5 hours in the future or in the past
O
No time
Gmt time I imagine
Gawd dammit neil
It use to be Up to God. The tomatoes the poles now is up to whoever's driving now. Just saying 4
Sorry but all his videos are so humiliating regarding the general stupidity of the general population that I have to give thumbs down. This guy is about as intelligent as einsteins lapdog
Now you will keep me awake.  LOL
My mind is blowed
It depends what direction are you facing
I'd suppose it's the one most convenient for your sleep schedule.
"yes, and, and, and.?."
Whatever time zone your at is what time it is no matter what your latitude
UTC/GMT
Start a question with another question thanks
I really miss Carl.
"CUT (Coordinated Universal Time) Longitude lines meeting, yet more proof of a spherical Earth."
At the North Pole there is not boundaries of any kind in this abyss in part because there is not land and no people. The sun rises and sets just once per year so no time of day is irrelevant as well.
What's the ANSWER!?!?!?
Whatever time you want
Put a sun dail up then
Probably just British time
What is the value of zero to the power of zero...
Depends on where you are facing
"When the astronomical concep5 of time is gone or diminished like in outer space or at a planet's poles, I believe that the only time that matters is biological time, when your brain says it's time to wake up, time to eat, time to sleep, that's the only clock that matters at a place where the world spins"
We don't take time of latitude as exact time we take aprox time. Like in india we take time of Delhi as the time of hole india it is approximate time not exact time
Zero oclock
It's miller time.
You can time travel by flying in rapid circles around the north or south pole.
"Lines of longitude do not de mark time but rotation of the earth based on the Equator. Time adjustments are made based on Latitude, thus time relates."
Please make a video with the answer because all ocd people will go crazy...I included.
Well that obviously depends on what time it is
"I would say would be the same time in each longitude, because you would be traveling in a circle much slower."
GMT right?
Since Polar days and Polar nights are a thing....the right answer is on and off.
"""Not that anybody asked-""

probably the best way to describe neil degrasse tyson"
Gmt surely??
Its always 5 o'clock at the poles
"The North Pole could be considered the ultimate location for New Year's Eve celebrations. Each time zone reaches midnight, one could celebrate the arrival of the New Year repeatedly, simply by aligning themselves with a different line of longitude each hour. At the South Pole, an individual could, in theory, celebrate Christmas Day multiple times by aligning themselves with different time zones as each reaches midnight"
I know north pole is basicly night time all winter and daytime all summer
"Just a visual representation, the poles follow a specific 24 schedule all the same as any other area"
This guy has to be like 20% high all the time.
Mind Blown.
I  just about rolled on the floor laughing.
Not that anybody asked. Time isn't real and it's something we created.
Well what's the answer?
ok again can you please pass the damn salt
Zulu time
"Man made lines, Time made man."
depend on what angle you face;
Lunch time
In the now
0 time
Our man made time Is made bye cycles around the sun.And the earth is cut up in sections.Great invention.
"0. Theres no such thing as time. Humans created ""time"" to keep some kind of record, or incrimates to live by."
There is no time at the north or south pole (assuming you talk about local solar noon).. well technically it could be any time up there since a vector with no magnitude has no direction.
Always winter but never Christmas?
You can choose any time you want it wouldn't matter... you wouldn't notice the difference
What do lines of longitude and us voters have in common? They all meet at the polls
So does time stop at the poles?
Why? What? How?
day time or night time  ..
Whatever time your facing
I can see the white rabbit!!!  lol
"If you stood exactly on the earth pole (north or south), would you notice the rotation?"
"So, what time do the polls close?"
depends  on what degree it is
Mind blown
32
Greenwich Mean Time
I assume UTC
True Time
Good point !!!
"At the poles, the time is now"
...is time as we understand it suspended?
... from everlasting to everlasting. If you could get there at all what really happens at such a place?
...I think Brian Green sort of covered this in the illusion of time.Time schedules were adopted to accommodate train travel. I think maybe the bigger question might be is do we age in such a place?

Bang O Clock
Always about 7:30 pm in winter and 12 noon in summer
"The rotation of our planet is not actually a measure of time, but a convenient way for us to divide a planetary rotation into segments which we can use to organise our lives
To answer your question, the time at the pole is exactly the same time as the rest of the planet"
"Sir, this is a wendys..."
the day is determined by the international dateline
Its noon!!
Time does not exist at the poles. Which is why Santa never gets old.
It's cold time at the poles
Only minutes on the poles. No hours.
"Utc/Zulu/Gmt, but if I run around in a circle counter-clockwise at the south pole, am I going back or forward in time?"
It's either Midday or midnight.
They demark time only to the extent that the system we have in place to track time says it does. A more interesting question is what effect does being at the poles have on time based on sciences conclusion that movement effects time and it's shown that time passes differently for someone at a pole then for someone at the equator.
Tell us.... jesus
"If a tree falls in the woods and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?"

It could be any time you want it to be
"I would have asked, however; I had a few teachers who gave a dang. Thank you Neil, for those who weren't as fortunate as I was."
Dang. He said erfh flat.
No time for love Dr. Jones
Hammer time?
Dude is a bosses worst nightmare when asked why he came in late.
"The time is ""always day"" or ""always night"" for 8 months"
Do people actually believe and listen to what this clown says or talks about!
Time is a made up concept lol just like the lines that represent latitude and longitude.
"Time on each longitude shows the time of the day. On poles, look at the sun and feel what time it must be."
Ask God.......
Well what time would it be?
It's party time!
Now.
I just kept thinking Neil needs a fresh trim.
"Easy. At the pole there are 360 degrees marked clockwise from the prime meridian. It will be noon where the sun crosses X line of longitude. 

Or: since the poles are not recognized as any national sovreignty, the time can be denoted as whatever time your home time zone is. 

And again!!!:  This is why there is Universal Time Code UTC which follows Greenwich (Zulu) time."
It's summer time or winter time
In summer the sun never sets.  In winter the sun never rises.
It's 5 o'clock somewhere
"Step forward for breakfast, then right for lunch. Head back for dinner then to the left for bed. Good way to spend an hour at the poles."
Greenwich mean?
Oh is that why the sun never sets there?
there is no pole
The time is the same time as the zone from where you came.
Its peanut butter jelly time
"Now I know, y nobody asked"
Does it matter on time of year based on the tilt of the earth?
Time is of no essence at the poles.
The current time is Now
"Time is just the movements of lights and therefore at the north pole has no nights. But the time telling us its already night, thought the ligjts of the sun is always present."
Noon or midnight
What day is it?
It's no time but all-time simultaneously.
Mind blown. Thanks Neil. Not going to sleep tonight.
When has no one asking ever stopped him from talking your tie?
ok time runs slower at the poles or faster or
if our clocks depict how long it takes for one earth rotation then theyre should be uh ah ooh ow my brain hurts stop it niel aaaah lollmao
I would go for GMT
no time dumb...
0:00
Lmao excellent one dude!!
Stop smoking
If you have a watch an you go from england to the pole without changing your watch for you it will be the same time as it  is where you came from
Whatever time you would like it to be
Whatever Santa wants it to be
"Well, I think the closer you are at the poles, the more likely you are to experience shifting time. Like, if you were at the exact center, any step in any direction would be a different time. You could literally go back and forth between days or go from 7 am to 7 pm or whatever. That'd be trippy..."

"""That means that one tiny atom in my fingernail could be one little, tiny universe."""
You know what time it is. Yes is the answer at the poles
It's 5 o'clock that's why you can drink at anytime and say it's 5 o'clock somewhere.
Time to find your coat cause it's f****** freezing
Goodnight Neil.
If you visualize Neil wearing a pith helmet you'd swear he's a clueless summer camp counselor.
He knows too much. Do something.
Not only that but as you get closer to the pole the lines are shorter and time goes faster until you reach the pole in which is all  times at the same time
"Or a few feet away from the pole (@ N pole, all directions are south)."
now
Time to have a really good coat.
Exactly the opposite time it is on the surface. There is no tome on the pole
I would use Greenwich  England
The time at the poles is was ever time you take with you any deeper then that is pointless like fnding the square root to pi pointless and a waste of time to figure out
That's a really good question. I wonder how you find that out
Greenwich time
ahhhhh!!!!!!!!!
Time to leave
Time stands still at the pole because the time starts at that time. It's the place holder of time... food for thought???
"Also why are there only 18 time zones in the nothern hemisphere and 32 in the southern hemisphere when there should be 24 equal time zones in both? This is 100% true if you take out the made up 1/2 hour and +1/2 hour ""times"" added in certain areas. The continental US has 4 time zones and Australia has 2 plus a fake 1/2 hour time zone yet both countries are roughly the same width"
My life just flashed before my eyes
Guess:  0000
Miller Time?
Love this guy
He clearly is smoking weed before making his videos
"The earth spins around the poles, thus, the poles are moving at much lower speeds relative to the equator, thus the same time goes by within that same timespawn that it takes to go around in the equator, the earth is just moving slower so it covers less distance in that same time, is neil getting old and less smart?"
"They are accurate because at the poles your relative speed is way slower, so, times goes by slower, wait till that part hits him, he's gonna freak the fk out"
The British Empire never had to ask.
Time doesn't exist there
The polls don't have time.  Time is a human determination based on your country leadership's determination.

Why are your pupils so large
"OBVIOUSLY MILLER TIME, ITS ALWAYS MILLER TIME."
"Time is basically irrelevant. The sun only rises and sets once per year. But basically, it is all and none of the times as well."

Nice.
Zulu time (UTC)
No body asked Tyson.
"Coordinated Universal Time, no?

Toilets (draining basins) don't swirl on the equator.  They drain with no rotational bias.  What do they do at the poles, magically fill with no water source?"
Noon
time is the same because that is where they start booommm!!!!! Question has been solved next Question
It's now. The time is now.
Never o clock
Same time that yesterday just little more late!
Grinich mean
"Directly at a pole, I guess there would be no discernible day/night cycle. You could almost shift one entire year, 365 days, into one big long day. Winter is night, summer is day, fall/spring are dusk. 

One could say June 21st is noon, or December 21st is midnight. The equinoxes dusk and dawn 

If we take today, June 11th, we are 172/365 of the way through the cycle, or 47.1%. This would equate to about 11.3 hours through a day. 

Thus today, June 11th is 11:18 at the north pole"
You ask such good questions.
"It's undefined at the poles, since a person at a pole will be on every line of longitude, so it will be multiple times at once which is incoherent."
"""What time is it at the poles?""
""Yes.""
But more seriously, I wouldn't be surprised if a circle of a small radius around the poles went by GMT. Great now I have to look it up. Thanks for nothing Neil."
Tell us McCluskey! Tell us what time it is.
No oclock
"So if you're standing at a pole then take a few steps in any direction and then walk a circle around the pole, have walked around the Earth?"
its pole time
There's no time at the pole
It's crazy time at the poles. Doesn't time run faster at the poles
There is no time.... that's why the sun never sets
It's pole time

Lines meet at the poles.. but Do not stop there..what time is it anywhere.. whatever one perceived time to be.. may be again.. and again.. maybe not.. I'm not a scientist.. usually let God handle these things..
The time at the poles is noon during summer and midnight during winter.
"Depends. If you're standing precisely where all the lines intersect, you'd be in all time zones at once, and therefore any answer is technically true. If you're only standing close to it, that's restricted to just the zones you'd be within."
"Depends which direction your facing. You line of sight would be like the hour and minute hand combined. 

Do a spin on the spot and you're time travelling."
I guess it is either half year long day or half year long night
Time is a man's creation of measuring duration I think time doesn't apply there unless you use your own preference for your own schedule depending on what zone you're going to or  coming from at the time you're at the pole
"That's why i believe time was man made just for s little what would we have if time didn't exist think about it. What if we take time out of everything, how much more would we progress"
I could listen to him all day.
"Now, is the time,,,,"
If you have a watch that's your first clue.
0:00?
All the time!
daaaaaang
4:20pm bro
How are his pupils THAT dilated
he needs to get some sun...he looks like he's dying
"*goes to tue pole
*runs in a loop to time travel"
GMT ?
"Conventional timekeeping may not align with natural light patterns at the poles, where there are periods of continuous daylight or darkness. 

At the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, people use New Zealand Time or sometimes their home times zones."
"The lines of latitude merge at a pinpoint so, except for that one pinpoint, it's apparent what time it is within each line. Answer #2 = Miller time"
"I suppose there would be an area where you can just walk a few steps, and the time would change by 12 hours."
The answer is yes and no
Elon must hire this old g as his manager two great minds can build somthing
Whatever time you need it to be
Time is an illusion.
...and they do that because the planet is ROUND!!
You can only kiss yourself on the lips in the mirror
Newfoundland Canada is the only place that has adopted the 1/2 hour time zone.
Central time zone duhh
Poland use GMT+2
24hrs
In the middle
i assume at the poles you have free reign and can enter into any timezone based on convenience (eg the city you are channeling your communications to).
What ever time you want it to be
It's every time you want it to be.
Dinnertime
GMT - Greenwich Mean Time.  Easy.
Its beer o'clock.
Daytime all the time
Greenwich mean time??  As that is the seem8ng start of timezones.
what is the time in first place ???
Wtvr time the govt says it is. Time is constant. The Lines are man made
Midnight
North America railroad systems created time zones.
Where you live is the time.
The very pole is a point that doesn't move relative to itself therefore it doesn't have time in the sense he's using it.
it is nuts .... 1/2 Y is polar night  and other 1/2 is polar day
Sorry.  Been lied to so much
Zero time (0)
On pols the time will be same as your current location's time.
Same time all day.
"Stand at the north pole and walk in circles, you can say you sped up time"
the truth is it has no time it's subjective
In the north pole a sundial works all day
Probably GMT
The poles are metaphorically frozen in time
les moonvest
"Time is man made, so it is irrelevant"
The only time that matters at the poles is chow time
High noon
It choose you're own adventure
The poles could fall in any time zone but usually use Greenwich time?
"As you said, all lines end in points that have no dimension."
"Even a broken clock is right Twice a day.  So how come Joe Biden can't even manage that, Neil?"
"You been smokin, Neil?"
I guess that in the poles is the origin.
"I think, all lines are coming to zero line, so time is the same as it is in London"
Who needs drugs just listen to Neil
21
"It is not for time, rather for sunlight. I am guessing it is either noon or midnight during the day, but depends on the season."
"9 o clock, next question"
"Always 12am or 12pm north pole?
Always 6am or 6pm south pole?
Lol"
Its always noon and midnight at the poles
Is there an answer Neil?
Stand on the pole and with one small step you can be in any time you want. Time travel?
no one knows
Its tea time
CHRISTMAS  TIME!!!!
All shadows of a sundial meet at the base. What time is it at the base?
Is that at the True NORTH POLE OR THE 15 Degrees Off True North ???
There no time. This is how Santa has time to make all these presents
hammer time
It's o'clock 24/7
Both the poles are assigned no fixed time zone. They are considered to be all time zones and none of them at the same time. Schrodinger's time zone if you will.
I know the answer: Summer and Winter !
Equator time of the side in which you stand.
the time of your country of origin
All times combined...
Jesus Christ is the LORD of Heaven & Earth. No one comes to the Father but by Him
Wait so you can cross all the time zones really quickly at the poles
0?
Probably utc
The one in the middle
The arctic and Antarctic are giant ice walls created by the government keeping us away from the black holes at the poles where time and space lose meaning
"Lines of longitude on earth demarc EARTH TIME ON EARTH... vs. Greenwich. 
At the Pole is always Greeneich time or if you're Russian the time in Moscow,  if you're French the time I'm Paris... etc.
The real time in this universe is an infinite ""line"" with demarcation on equal intervals (say years) starting from tha Big Bang...
Not that there was time before!
And I'm just kidding..."
Then make one universal time
My guess is that it's always 4:20 pm at the poles.
Yes what time would it be
S ame time
Time doesn't stop just because you're at the pole. I always thought the 2 poles were assigned to GMT.
It's voting time.
Time is irrelevant at the poles.
Gmt... prime meridian time?
"Sir, I just asked you what time it is :("
It's right now.
High noon lol
Interesting question... putting my money on GMT... UTC
"He time at the poles is right now, that's what time"
NEW DAY?
"Time zones are a social construct used to keep track of time in a constantly moving, global, industrial society. But why would it matter if you're in the North Pole, isolated from the global world and schedules? Just agree on any timezone with your group and adjust for when you get back to civilization. Or make up your own 24 hour scheduling so it isn't aligned to any timezone."
UTC?
"Both poles run on GMT, as does space, and before you ask no there isn't such a thing as space daylight savings time!
#Iain Lambert"
"Time is a human invention , it is a measurement of decay ( entropy ) . So , time being a mechanical invention the time at the poles is whatever a group of people decide it is , within the rules of keeping time ie : the 24 hour day & yes I know this is a thought experiment / joke . Honestly I think people are losing the ability to think through a thought to a conclusion & prefer to be told what to think ."
Longitudinal lines are larger than vertical lines. Time at the north pole depends on what season it is.
4:20
"Time scales are a customary issue adopted by all States, not a scientific one. At the poles, therefore, we solve the problem by custom"
"""Not that any one asked"" is your entire career."
Do you get jet lag if you run around in circles at the poles?
"But they don't demark time, there are an infinite number of longitudinal lines..."
"GMT, duh."
UTC or GMT
No time and all time. But there will be no aging in the center of the center
So how's that joint Neil ?
I'm a pole and it's 10:22 pm
"It is 100% the time, 60% of the time. Panther musk."
Your eyes don't look well. I hope your health is okay.
0 degrees.
"Well, at the north pole it's Miller time, and the south pole is Morphin' time."
Winter time or summer time.
It's exactly o'clock duh!
whatever the unicode timestamp is.
Hahahahahahahahahaha
So what time is it?
"Didn't check, but i bet on  GMT 0"
time doesn't care about the lines we draw for our convenience.
Not that anyone asked every 15mins you teach someone something with your silly self love ya
"""what time is it at the poles"" currently 1:17 in Poland as of creating this comment"
It is the sum of all times divided by 360.
Since a circle has an infinite sized centre point you will always be standing on one of the segments
The correct time.
Time does not work at poles on earth
Is it 00:00?
It is now!
I'm never going anywhere near the poles so don't need to worry about it.
Time is absolutely abstract
May be G.M.T.(Greneach mean time)
at poles one year = one day. it was known to Sumerians long time ago.
If its the summer solstice its noon. If its the winter solstice its midnight. The equinoxes are the 6s. Between those is guesswork
"I heard a quote or i made it up but, time does not exist. Timekeeping does."
Damn good question
Which also makes me wonder where exactly does the prime meridian cross the equator?
"Ive always wondered what's the ""speed of day"" if im at the equator and im flying due west, how fast do I have to travel to keep the sun in the same spot"
"I only asked you if you had the tine, sir. . ."
It's all the time lol
Nobody lives there
"So if you are a few feet from the poles, and you start running circles around it, are you a time zone traveler?"
"Ok,  so Neil has been seeing Vsauce now..."
It's GMT at the poles :)
My clock stopped at 11H35 so its always that time whenever I check
"Noon at the north, and midnight at the south pole!"
should be UTC 0 for the last 15 degrees of latitude at both poles to keep it simple.
"Seeing as he is an older man, I'm surprised he has just discovered this. Someone should suggest that he goes to live in Iceland for a year. See Greenwich Mean Time and the Discovery of Longitude."
Same as it is on the ISS: Greenwich Mean Time
It's either midnight or midday at poles depending on the seasons
"The poles officially have not only their own time zones, but also their own cardinal directions (N, S, E, W. Or at least Antarctica does)."
When Neil gets drunk.
Always 12 I assume
"""Not that anybody asked"" is literally the beginning of every conversation this guy has ever had."
"At the poles it is very cold, time is frozen there"
"Is it time already for people to realize this man is a buffoon? Ive seen some people starting to see it, but far too few."
"The answer is, peanut butter, jelly, time!"
"GMT, UMT.  By definition, obviously, that's what we should define."
Winter time
It is time To get prophet out of finland
"The time is 12 o'clock, you just don't know which one unless you know which half of the year it is."
"At the poles your smart watch will just blink ""NOW"".  If you walk in a circle around the pole; you had a full day."
Time freezes at the poles.
another flat earth er
Looking for a flat earther to educate me on this question please
literally nobody asked neil
every fifteen degrees is an hour
I think you mean latitude. it's not longitude longitude
whatever time it is on the international date line
Anytime. Any local time can be your current point of time at the North Pole
Ask a Pole.
In this home we respect the laws of phisics Neil...
Hammer time. Pick up the hammer
It's time for another episode of StarTalk!
It's 69 dude.
How's your covidian vax ideas working for you? Sold out enough?
The extreme cold at the poles slows time. Any schoolboy who has walked home in a blizzard knows this.
The o you person on Earther who loves hearing his own mouth run more than Kanye West
"""Pole-thirty"""
The poles are opposite times to one another
Is it relative time.
Daytime and nighttime
Get in the center and go in a circle and you can cover 24hours in a few seconds
Gone off you when I discovered you were a KOVID BULLY
"The 24 hour clock is irrelevant, so just use the clock setting which is most advantageous to your situation. This goes for anyone, but especially near the poles. There may be a lot of factors that go into this, but, really, this isn't a serious or important question."
Utc of course...
"Well if you were to find the exact point, and draw the exact 24 different longitude lines in their places, it would depend on which one you were standing in. If not that, take the closest landmass and just add it into their time zone. We already adjust for borders anyways why not just add in something else"
"//_= Not that I'm some 4th dimensional being, but time zones are only labels made by men. Its what ever time that the locals of the poles want to call it. Time is really not a line but a wibblily-wobbly mess."
"I think time at the piles would be the same, but with more emphasis on the seasons, as half your year is light and the other half darkness"
Time to go someplace warm.
Time is nothing but movement through space for it all to  the pole and ask what time is ridiculous it's to track time meet together then Tom keeps changing everything corrodes faster you grow older faster than everything slows down
I would imagine they use Zulu time.
That's why they had to make Alaska one time because it's closer to the pole and had 5 time zones
It depends on where you're standing
Whatever you want it to be.
Since you asked I think grennich is the best answer. Please correct me if I am wrong.
Depends which direction you are facing
It's all the time.
Proof that linear time is a man made concept
"The North Pole has no set time, but the South Pole is on New Zealand time because they supply Amundsen Scott."
Same time as it is at the black hole singularity and at the big bang.
"Neil was okay, then he became impressed with himself and insufferable."
"Nobody cares, Neil  OKAY?"
"whatabout 1km from NP, 2km, 3km each km makesdifferent zone?"
Zero O'clock... Fahrenheit... A.D...
It depends on where you are coming from. If you got to the pole via Sweden you use Swedish time. I think.
High-dia?
Think of bicycle spokes. The spokes at the axle spin at the same rate as the other end at the rim.
"I would have seen it'd be a GMT + 00:00

Because of the British
But then you could also argue that you would just use the time zone to which you originated from.
So if you came to the pole from let's say + 8 GMT
Then while you are at the pole, you would be using +8GMT

I think the latter is more likely because of time keeping.

But if your time zone is set by the GPS, your time on your phone is going to have a seizure"
5 oclock
Its GMT. At the poles...
His hair is slowly making him look like Einstein as he ages
"Fun thought experiment. I would place time relative to the sun's position over the globe. Would be hard, if not impossible to determine without a compass or clear object landmark that could act as your demarcation."
Time does not exist. Time is the creation of man.
"Time is for measuring the day... however days at the poles are 6 months, as the nights. 12 mo vs 24 hours. Any expedition to the poles would use a designated time zone."
I just asked what time it is
The real thing is that there are NO poles it's just a measurement
It's lunchtime.... for like 3 months straight.
Beer thirty.
i love this guys mind
Udc
Forever time....
"At the poles, it's all day"
"It is Central European Time. Well, mostly. Trust me, I am a Pole."
"Not that I'm answering something no one asked, the Sun giving shouldn't shadows on my end so I can't say, slim got a tilted brim. 4. Predictions and all. My Man"
Technically it's 0 even reverse
what ever time it is at the prime meridian
the second this dude hits a blunt he's figuring out how the universe works
Idk grab a sundial
"""What time is it at the poles"" relative to what?"
We compered  time by day & night.
that would be wednesday afternoon right atound tea time
imagine everday with him! every meal=a scintific fact
DAMMIT it Neil! Now I couldn't sleep!
time stands still when ur frozen solid
Anytime you want it to be but to be technical Zulu or GMT. Summer or winter. Day or night
Doesn't the satellite that maintains that have a cutoff within a set distance?
It is simultaneously every time zone and no time zone. The poles do not observe a specific time
I think there is zero time. No time passes on poles. Time is direction. More info in my tiny brilliant mind.
"Time is an abstract construct to relate events, so it's a bit of a meaningless question. It's as valid to consider it your home time as it is to consider it any other. The same is true in space, for example. What time is it if you're in orbit around Mars? Well, it's whatever time your timepiece says it is!"
Total light and total darkness
"GMT, keep it simple bro"
Man I just wanted to know whats the time right now
Greenwich time.
Probably universal time also known as UK time.
"If you were at the exact point of one of the poles(doesn't matter which), and the Earth stopped rotating. What would happen to ""you""?"
Same as equator I think
Greenwich time? 0:00
Depends on which longitude you are facing at the pole... That ll be the timezone you're in.
"shake it up shake up the happiness, wake it up wake up the happiness come on yo, its christmas time"
It depends on where your standing unless you are at the exact pole and not just near it because the exact pole is where they all meet so if you wanted to you could say that time zones don't exist there to make it easy because time zones are just a human construct to account for different areas of the planet based on the rotation of the planet that allows the sun moon and stars to move across the sky. Pleas note I said time zones are a human construct not time itself is a human construct because time it self existed before humans and will exist long after humans are gone the only thing we did was create a way to measure the passage of time.
Zero dark 30
Either day time or night time. Either way that time is now.
Any but zulu is the one they use i think
i would be perpetually day or night i think???
Tha time should be what it is at both poles.  Day or night woldwide.  It would not be hard to adjust to a one world clock.
That is the where in its 5 O'clock  somewhere
Zero 12AM 12PM time mass.
"easy, UTC"
"this is an easy one mr Tyson, at the poles we have either mid night all the  time through winter and half autumn and spring, and mid day in summer and the other halves of spring and autumn"
All times and no times simultaneously.
"6 months of daylight, 6 months of night time at the poles."
Most pretentious man in all of science
