Hey Chris! Best tips on how to remove pet (specifically dog) hair from seats and carpets?
"Just did rear brakes on my RAM. I can say based on this video, I didn't lube any parts and I didn't clean the new rotors. Could this be the reason why mine are still squeaking? That was my problem with the original brakes that I just changed. Thanks!"
So he's never said this before and I'm sure he knows but if you use tire cleaner it makes everything that is black underneath your hood look amazing so what I did is I used a steamer steam the whole engine down first cleaned it up as good as I could then I came back and sprayed it down with the black tire cleaner and it made everything so black and glossy it looked beautiful
"You work for 40yrs to have $1m in your retirement, Meanwhile some people are putting just $10k in a meme coin for just few months and now they are multimillionaires.I pray that anyone who reads this will be successful in life"
Very Nice Bro! Get Good People!
My tip is too look for small fire damage cars. Since where i live most of the cars are disesl i go for DPF fires. My favourite car to flip is a W204 C class with the 2.2 engine. You can get theme for 2000eur and sell theme for 8000eur easy. They go in flames a lot. Also i like neglected commerical vehicles. You can alywas make a proffit on vans since they are rubist so there engine and transmission is rearly damaged. All they need is some good clean and a can of spray paint to fill all the scraches.
We didn't see a link for the lug nut torque wrench used in this video
This is beautiful!
"Admittedly, I did not watch every second of this video, but I believe you need a license to do this in most states unless it's a one-off project? In KS, for example, you can only sell 4 vehicles in a given year without being a licensed dealer."
"wait I saw this episode already... f**** it I'll watch it again, its chrisfix"
Hey what did you use for the plastic outside that it looks brand new?
"I dont know what about your country, but in my country you need to pay 19% tax instead of 2% tax if you sell car within 6 months of having it. Flipping ain't easy here."
Do you have a video that talks about how to setup your entity? Private owner won't work right; you have to setup some sort of LLC or something to protect from litigation?
That is helpful
Thanks
i just watched this whole video and im going to go ask my mom can i clean her car for sum money thank you for this awesome video!
imagine selling your car for $500 then coming to find out it was a $5 fuse
Yea this is for mechanics only no ordinary person will know how to do these fixes
You're a very cool dude it was nice to watch
Pretty sweet vid here
Where do you find these cars? Ebay? Facebook? where?
I definitely subscribe to your channel.
8000 Dollars profit for a dirty car? cant belive only for a dirty car
That blue maserati is the star of the video!
nobody gonna talk about the super clean transition at 13:50?
Why don't you cut this video into 3 or 4 videos? You are doing yourself a disservice by combining all the topics into one viddo.
Love this guy he is great
Anyone else taught it was a tesla?
"Nice video, butttttt..... That's not the best way to check for a head gasket leak on a Prius.
You need to remove the spark plugs, and look inside the cylinders at the pistons.  Usually, #'s 1 and 2 will 
look ""steam cleaned"" depending on how bad it's leaking. 
You can also put a pressure tester on it and look inside the cylinders, you will probably see coolant 
seeping into the cylinder.  If the gasket is leaking.
And since the coolant was low, I would say the head gasket IS leaking.  It's small now, but will get worse.
Mine just started at 301,000 miles.  It was very small, so I caught it just as it started.
That's for the nice videos!"
""
I watch these and like to think I could do all these repairs easily but know nothing about working with cars
How did you learn to do all of this?
"Insruance bill, morgage. Obviously, you were never a queen bee. Otherwise quality content."
"Another great video! This guy has earned every single subscriber, including me. Hands down one of the coolest channels on youtube!"
13:28 Math?
"e85 , WTF"
Bunch of bullshit
His voice.... *ITS SO F*CKING SATISFYING*
Your skill set is masterful. A lot of this could only be done with your skills. I would lose a lot of profit having to pay for things you can do yourself. I can still see a great profit margin having a good mechanic. Great video. Definitely inspired.
"Good sir, you just gained another subscriber!"
i dont understand why i guessed prius
@chrisfix how much do you think fixing a Suzuki grand escudo.
"You made a check list for everybody? Who is this guy? Great videos, so much free info, even a total newbie like me can learn a thing or two."
bro no before/after for the seats?! torture!
"Given the current economic difficulties that the country is experiencing in 2023, how can we enhance our earnings in stocks during this period of adjustment? I cannot let my $680k savings vanish after putting in so much effort to accumulate them."
"As a rust belt resident, i hate you for having not seized and rotten manifold bolts"
Insane first car
"Cant believe you are at 9 million + subs. I remember watching you when you only had a few thousand. Good job bro, stay on the grind!"
"30mil per gallon IS SHlT!!
That is 50km per 4.5 liter, meaning 9 liters per 100km- for 60 miles you need 2 gallons.
That is HUGE waste of fuel, not to mention that my VW Passat 4x4 has 7.6liters for 100km( 1.75gallons for 60 miles/30miles per0.875 gallons).
What are you doing over there?"
that vandalized car flip was so sick! I would of thought the car was done once someone put sugar in my gas tank
I live in the shadows of giants.
"this isnt for everyone, If your going to do this you had better know what your doing."
Since I am 15 I am gonna flip cars as a main job this video helped me a lot thanks man
"Hey guys - do you register the car in your name before flipping it? In CA, it's illegal not to register it in your name and pay the taxes."
to take painT mate use brake cleaner or  carbon cleaner dont spend time 100 % work and dont damage lacker
the art of saying complicated things are easy ah ah. Good Job. Love the energy!!
I was always shown how value is depreciated with the age of a car. Then it becomes a classic and the value goes up. This world of jokers making everything more valuable is nonsense. Where is all this value much more money coming from. Why is it more expensive to buy used? Because people love to make fools of others and make things more valuable with some form of words. I wish my words carried as far. But I am not paying people to listen. I just offer thought.
"""does a viper engine fit in a del sol"" not a question i would have ever asked but now i need the answer to it."
i never trust a washed engine...
For the time past on it and the price of this qualification the deficit is more than -1000.
"Do you buy and sell the cars in your name, or did you set up a LLC or other business structure?"
"I used to be an excellent math student but that 2500/3500 halfway being 2700, must be an example of new math lol."

"Very high skill and knowing stuff its part that you forget to include in price , this its not simple to do and yeas you can ear a fcking lot since big majority of people can't do this"
"""But like anything else, with risk comes reward"". Um, no that's not how risk works."
"Hey Chris,  you forgot to put in four piston returns springs. That's why the engine is so weak."
There is ABSOLUTELY no way that this car wasn't starting up only BECAUSE of a burned fuse.
This is like a clips episode lol
Hey what are the process of registration and all ? Do we need a license for that buying nd selling ?
Step 1: go to copart

What about the title? Do you sign the title when you buy it or do you leave it blank?
check out this before .... aaaand after!
"you might have already gotten that tip, but i think you realy should look into a circular Polarizer for shots like the one for the headlights. would help with the reflections. it also makes paint look better"
"Thanks For the free Ph.D. in Car Flipping, ChrisFix!"
For me as a german it's just shocking to see what kind of junk drives around the us xD
You are awesome!
Hey chrisfix i love your videos man
BEFORE... AND AFTER.. LOVE IT CHRIS
"""does a viper engine fit in a del sol"" dude HAHAHAHA"
"If I never learn anything else from this channel, I know you need clean woter."
Do you really recommend trying to buy and flip a car that doesn't start?
Hard to believe someone didn't bother to check and change a fuse and let the car go away for 500.
I love watching your videos and learn stuff. Thank you!
It's a toyota just detail it and replace  some worn parts instant profit. It's not like he's showing us a beat up gm car .
"Nice and quality work there. I wonder how quick buyers come to you, usually how many days/weeks pass when you can sell a car ?"
Are you an automotive tech?
Sir do you consider PPF a worth to invest on a Brand new car?

Brooooo thats frcking amazing and thats what I want to do in my life. Can I get contact to you? I might have some questions
WD-40 woulda taken that spray paint off your car. never use a pressure washer...
i think this is the best video i have seen on youtube
"You need an oscillating tool if you really want that dirt out of the carpet. Get a small piece of angle aluminum, clap it onto an oscillating tool blade, hammer it to make it stay. Now you have a tiny hammer that vibrates so fast it literally levitates the dirt and can be sucked away as it floats out of the carpet!"
"Step 2- buy a car for any price, step 2- make a video that gets 1m+ views, step 3- sell for any amount."
u baught a car for 3700 dollars yeeeez for all those errors he would've been happy for the 2500 tbh
but way use the coin when you got the marks in the tires 45:20 you are almost having the fingers on the marks and when you hit them all to same level get new tiers
You are Great! And you are going to be my mentor to get out of my homeless situation by flipping cars!
That's only working in idiot nations like the USA.
How do you clean windscreen wipers??
35:36 Nice hair Chris.
Another great video Chris! The Amazon affiliate product links in the description are exactly what I was looking for!
"Chris is there a way i can intership with you? You don't even have to pay me. I've been trying to learn how to be a mechanic for years. No one or nowhere i apply to contacts me back, even when i annoyingly contact them over and over to check up on if they've taken a look at my resume. I have no issue with relocation as i live in expensive California and have been trying to leave anyway. I'm 24 and don't know what direction to take my life, but i know mechanics is one of the things im interested in as i want to be able to work on/ fix my own vehicle(s) instead of having to pay a bunch of money that others price for parts & LABOR. Is there any way i can contact you? Would you be willing to?"
Lacquer thinner would pull that spray paint off much easier and only hurt the clear if you stay in one spot too long
My Grandma flips cars!
"I got a sick deal on a van earlier this year. $650 which is ridiculous for a 2009 van here in Norway. It had a ""gearbox issue."" The syncro in first and second was completely disintegrated. I opened the gearbox while it was still on the car and took out the shaft and just replaced the syncro myself (a new one cost $150). There was more wrong with it but nothing I couldn't fix with elbow grease and another $200. It's a $3500 van now."
Hell I live in an area with a lot of cheap beater cars. I might have a future side hustle.
This video only makes the used car market worse and I don't appreciate it.
Very good presentation!Well said!
Somebody cheated on their gf with that Chrysler....
Savage.    Your good.
"Oh my god, that fuel tank melted is scary!"
Try getting your parts at RockAuto

"Did you replace head gasket without planning??? Lol... Only people who have no idea about car mechanic, can watch this content...."
Hi Chris! What do you use for the outer faded plastics? Any brand or product recommendations?
Do you need to transfer the title to your name or can you just sell it with the previous owner's name still on the title?
The Prius looks like it's a long way away from home. That sticker outline on the bumper looks like California's diamond lane pass.
"How to flip cars
Step 1: Be a mechanic"
and the tools he used was 50k
I would totally buy a flip off Chris.
"Two major requirements for this.
1. Be a mechanic.
2. Be young."
"tbh if i see a cleaned engine bay in a used car i wanna buy, i automatically assume they are trying to hide big issues with leaking oil."
would it still be worth it to have the interior and exterior cleaned if something you can't fix is wrong with the engine?!
I wish you were just near by. I could pay work on my cars!
Keep pushing out these great videos!
"Too many iffy situations. Have to know how to repair cars. Basically, restore the appearance and make them driveable. No one will buy a car that will not pass Safety Inspection or Emissions.
Oh! Best to live in a large city and have your own tow vehicle and a garage to do the repair work or available parking space. No one will drive 30-plus miles to get a junker. Got to have the proper tools to do the job. Time is money!!!! Start Small, Slow, Smart, and Safe. A bunch of ""S"". Sell big and Save money or make money. NICE LIST of what to look for >>>>"
"Thx Mister, I will comply. You rock with this vids btw."
How did you develop your skills?
"Hey Chris, it is spelled MORTGAGE, not MORGAGE. For such an INTELLIGENT FELLA, that was a DOOFUS MOVE."
cheapest car in my country costs more than 5000 usd
Glass headlights need to be manufactured again. Surely Plastic headlights cover proved to be problematic and low quality. Glass headlights with a protective shutter proof remain clear forever and don't change color. People forget what is quality. Today's engineering ideas is built on a sand foundation. To much sophistication in production but no quality in mind.
"Headlights problems is embedded and created by the auto industry greed over max profit  substituting quality materials with plastics. Plastic is not good when exposed to sunlight, heat and pressure. It react to oxygen. Nevertheless it can be applied in a specific areas to prevent rust were water circulate. We need to start producing save glass headlights again because they remain clear forever even when exposed to sunlight."
Prius just buy the ones with bad batteries that's the easiest way to get them cheap rebuilt battery is easy to Diy.
What do I do about registering the vehicle and insurance? How can I maximize profit with having to pay that
"did i just watch this entire video, knowing that i will never use this knowledge!?"
I'm pretty sure that Chris' soapy wader alone will fix all my life problems ;)
whats the brand or ur car vaccum extrator
"19:17 thats a good way to get yourself killed, that little rock can easily slip.
place something thats larger than you and that can carry the weight of a dropping car in that case you dont get smushed might anything happen."
100% appreciate that you are not doing this as a get rich quick scheme and clearly stated upfront that it isnt easy.
5:26 somebody SAMPLE THAT please
Can someone tell me what kind of polish machine did he use?
Dude this guy is amazing. I love how you show people how to do things. You can start a whole company just off of your amazing video. You are a national treasure my guy
Not just for cars but I always abid to the first line from the ChrisFix bible (that I probably heard long time ago): Cleaning is the highest ROI activity when flipping stuff.
Awesome show Thanks for the ideas.
"Totally correct about cleaning being the best bang for the buck - not just in your car but in your house or at your job.  Cleaning costs almost nothing and it really improves your state of mind, it can keep things from deteriorating beyond just getting dirty.  There are techniques and materials to learn about that can make it quicker and easier but it's always a winning strategy to keep things clean."
What brand ramps do you use?
please make a video on paperwork that's involved in buying and selling car without increasing the number of owners.
"You're probably one of the only people I would actually trust to have done work on a car and consider it worthwhile... internet ads with people talking about how they've "" put money into it"" means nothing to me."
Wooater
What about dyeing the center console fabric black?
what about state limits? like you can only buy & sell so many cars per year before having to register as a dealer?
Death distress divorce are key words that I look for.
This is some gta stuff
Brz first
"I.e. make sure you're a mechanic and you have a lifetime of mechanic tools in your garage. 

Not exactly for everyone, unless you plan on turning people into mechanics."
This makes me want to buy a used car from you - all I need is something safe and clean
"@ChrisFix, is that a Hoover or Bissel extractor vacuum?"
"No scam, just skills. Knowledge is money indeed."
What kind of website can you use if you live in Europe and not the US or Canada?
500$ fuse
So you are rich now?
A faster way to remove vandalism  is lacquer thinner

"4:26 that's impossible in argentina, the cheapest car its like around 3000 USD and with 300 at month its impossible to get 3000, and the fix will be like anothers 3000, that trailblazer will be around 10000 or more"
remember we have switched out a prius battery pack here before
What happened to your Del Sol?

"Dude, you make this look so easy it makes me want to do this but you're a legit pro!"
Thanks for all the tips!
Bro has ALL the tools and chemicals at hand!
Chris must be single. My girl would not give away these weekends
Hey what products did you use on the blazer to detail it!!
Love your energy and attitude!
"Buddy, you are really good, I watched the whole video and usually I never do that. It was so informative and kept me interested. Sub!"
"As a welder, you triggered me with that exhaust hahaha"
Before and After
Did u could you get to sell the Honda del sol
When you have the talent that Chris has one can make some serious cash.
Do you guys ever wash and reuse the microfiber towels or are they basically trash afterwards
"What a fantastic, thorough video!!  Thank you for this--I'd buy a car from you in a heartbeat!"
God bless you with the good deals you are selling them for
damn bro that little car is a keeper!!!!
"obviously you can make money if you have mechanic skills.  i do not.

Amazing thanks for this!

"which would you recommend for headlights the most, the ceramic coat method you used here or the clear coat you used 8 years ago on you video?"
Its fun watching crishfix
"Car can be worth 'easily' anything, but it's not the same as sold"
doo a video on a chevy cruzee and teachh us how to fix code 84 on the  turbo diesel
Changing ther windshield is not that big of a deal. A spare windshield is also quit cheap (100-150 bucks if you are lucky)
my wallet is crying
I love Chris fix soooo much. I have a 1994 honda del sol with 280k miles on it. Original motor and trans and Chris fix has helped my father and I keep this car in prestine condition. Chris fix is by far the best car guy out there for learning and I would reccomend all of his videos to anyone!!!!! 1000% wholesome and helpful
"Chris + Soapy Water.  

Name a better duo.  I'll wait."
I always spend a day cleaning any car I'm trading in. I've always felt I get more for a car the dealer does not need to clean.
"I used to watch this guy, years ago and I  was scrolling around and seeing car ads then I remembered this guy but I couldn't remember his name so I searched few videos and found him again"
"I really like the promptness to his videos. Consice , clear and to the point."
am i the only one that freaks out every time he just sprays the whole engine bay with water and other liquid?
Great vid but The hardest part of flipping the car is finding the car imo. You seem to find these bargains effortlessly.
Before and afteuer :Z
35:40 you have funny haircut man.
"Where did he learn all this, I wanna learn how to fix cars. What do I do?"
Legend.
subscribed
Aren't you supposed to be car technician to know about the cars?
where did you order the factory carpet for the car?
I hate dumb car flip videos. Now the used private seller are just filled with people trying to flip salvage title cars or people overcharging for beaters. Man take me to the pre social media days.
Hey Chris extraordinary content you have going. Just wondering what type of education or training have you had that helped you get to where you are?
What drill attachment are you using to cut the floorboard?
Could you do a comparison between the 3 in 1 wax paint polish and the 3 individual products?
"4:46 BRO WHY IS YOUR CAR VAPING




(It's probably oil starvation)"
Where can we buy one of the cars you've worked on? I need one for my granddaughter.
do you do voiceovers for your videos or are they recorded in real time?
"Genuine question:
Headlights treatment is different from what you shown in the ""super clean headlights"" video. Which technique is better?"
"Gosh, this video was soooooo educative!!!!"
ChrisFix is the best!
"Hi there, what platforms do you use to sell your cars?"
"Hey Chris. This my first video from you that I've watched. I'm just curious, do you have any previous mechanical work background?"
Cars are masculine my friend.
"How to flip a car easily:
Step 1: hit the gym
Step 2: get in a good squatting position
Step 3: lift with your legs, not your back
Step 4: flip"
"Wow, he really cleans the cars perfectly."
"This has nothing to do with the car or the video, but I like the computer. Where did you get it from?"
I love this video
It's not under 3 grand anymore... in this area they're like 10-15 grand
9:33 Squidward art is incredible
"This video was in my recommended videos (probably because I've been researching buying used EVs) and while I know that I personally couldn't do this side hustle for multiple reasons, I watched the whole video.  I have so much respect for not only what you do but the production quality of the video itself.  Making people a checklist and just posting it in the description as well.  So much respect.  You're awesome!  (Also got a good laugh at that ""Meet in the middle at $2700."")

This was really interesting to watch, if for nothing else, to at least see how much you can simply clean the car out and really improve it.  I don't have the extractor vacuum, but it seems they're pretty easy and cheap to pick up.  Basically anyone can do this if they're dedicated enough, and I see so many used cars that just don't do it.  We'll see if I'm too lazy when it comes to selling my old Nissan Leaf in a year or two."
hmmmmm
Did he come out with the video for the center armrest or did I miss it?
Great video! Gotta ask whats the attachment on the drill at 6:10? Keep up the good work!
"Mission failed. Flipped my car, my insurance company voided my insurance."
What I love is that this isn't a how to hide flaws it is how to legitimately fix things and make it a car people want to buy
"Drifting into the trading world without the help of a professional trader and expecting profits is like turning water into wine, you would need a miracle, that's why i trade with  Mrs.Priscilla Snyder,her skills set is exceptional."
here is an easy fix.. replace the head gasket..oh rusted floor pan. no problem get the right size and shape metal cut to fill the hole exactly and then WELD>>>(you have a welder dont you? Mig? Tig? electric arc?) of course you know how to use it so you dont burn or blind yourself....yeah. ! nothing TO IT>....
"well if that gmc had started and then not gone into gear. rebuilt transmission...new springs and struts..or a frozen motor, burning oil (new rings ) leaking head gasket.. you could have bought multiple thousands of dollars in trouble and labor. how did you figure that risk. what do you do when the steats are worn out and have holes."
"chris , your such an inspiration to me , as a beginning mechanic.  I dont know how you do it, but your totally awesome."
Tax title license?
"Hey Chris, what would be the alternatives from using a ceramic coating on the headlights in order to get that UV protection? Thank so so much in advance"
This dude deserves all the subs he has. This is real content!
"Hi Chris and I luv ur videos.  I am 71 years young lady and I am looking 4 a used prius V,  so your video was just what I needed to see.  I live in NYC and it's hard finding a vehicle thru a dealer or private sales when they see a little young lady coming to view their vehicle.  I look 4ward to your next video. thks roxanne"
Thank you
"amazing details this is definitely a must try experience , i just wished you linked the site that you buy parts from , used or new ."
"Chris: ""This is a easy fix""
Dealership: ""Here is your repair estimate, total $2000"""
Never knew u could put hubcaps on top of rims like that
Your videos are full of BS and you have no idea about cars. Anyone who knows anything about cars will definitely realize that
Super video. Was wondering how you handle title transfers.  Do you have a dealer license?
me watching this so i can make my future broken car look good so I can sell it for more
Hey Chris how many pads did you use to buff the whole car?
Awesome video
Under $500 for parts needed?? No way...
Heeheeheehaw
"Hey Chris... when you will make a video about the process of flipping a car but in terms of PAPERWORK ? Do you get a bill of sale, a title, you register the car under your name? How do you deal with taxes, fees  and all those things in between before sell the car?  If you make a profit on a car that had been devaluated, you have to pay taxes? all of that means a lot of money so I think its important to address. Nobody talks about that, and its a priority knows how to do in the right way. I'll wait for that video. Thanks for your wonderful channel."
"Your videos are awesome, this is the type of work I would choose to do because I WANT to do it not because I have to. Question, would it be better to do all of this work indoors?"
"Stop saying ""She"". It is a car. Not a ""She"". It is very annoying."
Note. Sugar does not damage engines. At most it plugs up fuel filters. Sugar does not dissolve in gas. It dissolves in water so it does not hurt anything. Change your fuel filter a couple times and send er'.
"Dirtier the better is my motto too....montana logger gas spill special, N. Dakota oil field solid carpet special, tralior park nine kids petrified fries minivan special, B.C. hippy tour van special, show dog great Dane headliner special, Oregon hash grower special etc.....Too fun...don't forget the OO steel wool on the glass and acid on side glass with water marks and of course the wheels. Oh ya...air and a tornador, also the best on carpets!!!"
Keep being awesome chris.
34:26 if i had three hands i could fix up cars EZ

How do you know the worth of a car in good condition
"You not only have to account for the car price and repair price, but also sales tax, if you buy a $4000 car that's about an extra $250"
I hate head gasket problems because unless you send the block to a machinist theres at least a 80% chance that who ever you sell it too will have the problem again pretty quickly
"you can't really sell more than 5 cars per year, unless you sell them without transferring them to your name, or you invest into a dealership license... please comment on that"
Swiffer wipes work fantastic on dust and pet hair on the interior plastics as well. Unless your car is real bad 2 cloths will do a good sized car.
this car search is actually very helpful. its how I'm making a 4k mx5 into a car worth 12k+
"I flinched and closed my eyes when he started to weld the exhaust as if it was muscle memory, then laughed my ass off realizing I'm watching this through a screen and it won't hurt my eyes haha"
I have considered buying one of these. Replacing the battery is the issue.
"""'good used car"" people before ww2: oh you mean the ford model t? us seeing a ford model t for sale: OMG I WANT IT! seller: ok. HOW MUCH DOES IT COST? seller: uh, $850,000. (never tries to buy old and used cars again)"

"Man, Chris is generous. The fact he goes out of his way to put in OEM pumps even when the original pumps were fine really goes to show how good of a person he is. Also, Miata *is* always the answer."
"Hey just a quick question how do you manage to get car parts sooo fast, is it just the editing that does that or do you pay massive shipping expenses or is there a site you use?"
Dude found a a 500$ car because it had a blown fuse

Such a quality video!
"Chris do you have any Leather car Seat repair videos? crack, holes, etc

this man should make his own dealership
Chris Fix is Legend
"Do you pay for title transfer when buying the car ? When you use clay bar , did you finish the whole car with the same car ? Is the contaminant on the bar going to scratch the other panels ?"
"Not a question, how to buy for 2 and sell for 8. Question is, how then that 8 bucks car that I buy to sell for at least 12"
A genius guy.
My question on the trailer blazer is how do you know the fuse won't melt again?
where can I get the soapy water and all those sprays?
For hazed plastic like the belt buckle. A heat gun goes a long way to bring the color back ;)
Awesome detailed vid! Love it!! How much was the Hybrid Battery and did it resolve the issue?
How do you make soapy water
"Kudos on the new fuel sender/pump unit. you had the tank out, after that it is literally a 5 minute job, potentially that unit is $100 or so but huge value for a buyer."

"Do you have to pay for registration, insurance or emissions testing when you first buy the car you intend to flip?"
"hey chrisfix i got a ford 4x4 problem which when i accelerate and hold it 110 kmh, and the gear is auto neutral what should i do."
Anyone knows why I cannot save this video? The 3 dots that we see on the bottom right are nowhere to be seen.
35 MPH with gas pedal floored? Sounds like its running correctly.
"Thanks bro, I appreciate the vids. Was very entertaining and educational, I can see the amount of work you put in and I respect and appreciate it. Keep up the good work!"
What kind of welder did you use on muffler?
Today aged I figured out I can spray liquid on engine bay lol
Dude I love your channel
"Hi, @Chrisfix which orbital buffer do you use? Is it a Ryobi brand?"
The best channel I have ever subscribed to.
He fails to mention paying sales tax and registration fees.
How do you fill out your tax forms on something like car flipping?
"Exciting content, the only comment I have is the way you calculate profit, not to give any false idea to anyone who thinks this is pure profit. What needs to be added is the hours spent flipping a single car. From finding the car to cleaning, fixing, and selling. As well as the price of all the tools, cleaning supplies, etc. since most people would probably don't have any of that.
For example, if you have spent 20 hours fixing a car, an average good car mechanic with the skills you show here probably makes $25-$40 per hour or more, depending on the location. So if it took you 20 hours = 20* 25 = $500, this is how to calculate if something worth your time when there is an alternative job, If there isn't one than this is a perfect content to start making some income."
That Chrysler transformation was crazy. What a job.
chrisfix is literally a chad for being this awesome all i know
"I can't believe I watch the whole video. :D loved his""before end efter"""
"The main thing I would add when flipping cars is fix it before doing all the cleaning, if you spend a full day bringing it back to life and find out there's more to fix eg. The battery didn't cause the transmission to slip well then your out another 1500, then you'll need to ask yourself is it worth fixing or parting."
you should include costs for equipment. especially for people starting out no tools. etc
"I like the brushes.  I worked for my brother's detailing business and we always would silicone the dash.  Did a lot of work for dealerships.  One critique I'd give on this video would be to wash it first, and use the pressure washer to get the door jams and then do the interior, you rarely even get any water inside and would save on that wash and wax and can just silicone that or buff the paint.  Or keep that wash and wax and it would be a lot quicker.  We also would degrease the engine and then power wash it (carefully, yet fairly aggressively) with the engine on.  Never heard of any issues from clients."
Can you reuse that blue indicator fluid for the head gasket leak tester if it stays blue?
Tell me why ive taken my car to 4 different shops and one actually gave me a refund like wtf this guy seems like he can do anything so easily
Curbed wheels are also super common with used cars
isnt this illegal in communist California? you must live in a Free State
I have an old Toyota that has really yellow lights. What would you recommend to fix it?
"Thank you Chris!! As per usual, I'm learning a ton from you. Only one detail though - even with the circuit breaker removed, I wouldn't spray and definitely not hose down the engine bay of a hybrid, the inverter is there and you're working with hundreds of volts at high amperage so that's deffo one wet contact you don't want to have. Is there another way to dry clean the engine bay for similar results?"
Done. Now lets find a buyer
You cannot be rich or famous without liying . Prove me wrong.
"I bought my 2014 dodge avenger wrecked with airbags deployed for $400. Replaced hood, bumper, fender, crash bar, radiator, windshield, both airbags and both front seatbelts. All in im right around $1,500 including the price of the car. It now has close to 300k miles, but no check engine light or anything. Drives smooth as a dream.
It even has a clean title too because the accident was never reported."
"Sure, a guy selling a non starting car due to a fuse. Please, stop the cap."
"Chris, I always like your videos. I would like to learn one on one from you if you would permit me"
"Never thought our vehicles would need nutrition facts but never the less here we are now needing to label our cars sugar free or non sugar free, boy how far we have come"
"When flipping cars where do you get your parts? Do you get most from the junkyard, order online or just local parts store?"
Would you ever start your own dealership?
Oh man. Some 200 owner really pissed off his gf
I literally dont know how to do any of this
Be very careful buying a car in 2023 lol

Awesome video!!!!
Is this the hybrid that u replaced the battery?  Still for sale?
Have you made a video on how to buy the perfect first car for a highschool student. Cheap and reliable?
Where did you buy the floor mats for Prius
Do you need a dealer license to sell multiple cars?
it is most profitable olny when you know all these works.
"Well done, you got the patience and talent. Happy for you. Keep the good work and profits."
"This is a God Mode! Man you are awesome! Video editing is on a different level, thank you"
"@ChrisFix, you sprayed down the engine bay with water at 37:50, will that not degrade the electrical components contained within the engine?"
I was following until u pulled out a dang welder like cmonnnn
Or pay for printer toner lol
What tool he use to cut the floor

Omg Chris you are so close to the 10 million diamond play button and a few more to one more video you will be the first one on the automotive niche on YouTube to get the diamond play button
Where do you like to buy car parts / cosmetic interior parts from?
Lemme work with you bro
The previous owner saw this video. He wants his Prius back.
Is the compound polish unethical?
the polisher at 36:15 sounds like that one song (i forgor the name)
Will that work at high tax state like israel?
so be a mechanic first?
I refuse to believe that you can get these kinds of deals outside of NA bro...
You should try a clay mit... I used to use one during the car wash when I lived in a house..it makes quick work of it and same smooth results
"Hey Chris what is the wash and wax for, I didn't see you using it in the video but it was linked, I don't wanna do anything wrong :("
Most people aren't mechanically inclined to do auto repairs themselves or purchase the equipment it takes to do the jobs. Just a horrible idea for someone who doesn't have the resources.
"Not gonna lie, I'd LOVE to do this sort of thing, I'm real good at mechanic stuff, you just need money to buy stuff with for the car haha. So eventually that ends up taking quite a chunk out of profit"
0:31 0:34
if you buy a car that has a huge flaw but you don't notice it and clean it up to sell and then someone buys it what if they come back at you down the line if the car breaks?
"Would a car that has a ticking noise worth fixing may be lifters ,"

@chrisfix I  want to buy a car from you
"Funnily enough I have a 05' Trailblazer, where did you get new interior trim pieces from,? Been having trouble locating a place to source them from online. Thanks in advance."
I am just following your channel hopefully one day I'll follow my dream job ...
"I like that not only do you restore the car into great looking condition, you also remind us to put on additional protectant so that the great look will last longer for the next owner."
"How many claybars per car? After that one panel it looked dirty, can you still use the same one again?"
I need you in UK
You do some exceptional work man

"Lots of work, however, it will be very rewarding !"
"Thanks for this videos i want to start, now im saving some money working, i want to buy some little garage which can have 1 or 2 cars inside, and repair them there and make some money i hope it goes good."
Not a car guy but you have excellent presentation.
I just want to know why your saying 4/32 when it is 1/8 saying 4/32 is like like saying 2/16
"Such good content. Pure simple. No swearing, clean to the point. Great"

Where did you get the floor mats for Prius
More flip videos would actually be cool. Cool to see transformations and the step by step of it
How do you like the Ryobi cordless polisher? I've been thinking about getting one for the cordless convenience.
"He made it look easy, but this ain't no easy task, identifying the problem, knowing which car sells, and repairing the car itself is pretty much hard labour hard"
"Make sure you pay attention to how Chris communicates, giving full transparency to build your trust and break any doubt you may have about his knowledge. Having a great character is understanding how to create opportunities, engage experiences fearlessly and ultimately educate. Wishing everyone the best in all things by way of self improvement!"
"Here I am, once again, watching your videos for fun, knowing full well I will never attempt almost any repairs you show"
"It's so insane to me that Americans are out here buying 300-dollar cars while you need to be a millionaire in my country to even get a used car. You can easily spend 1.3M for a 1999 Toyota Vitz here.
1M = around 18k+ in dollars for context."
Car wizard in action.
Thnx to this vid I know how to go round sugar free
"Hey, how do you sell the cars so fast at the fair prices you're talking about? Is that just trade in or are you finding buyers?"
Damn whoever owned that White Chrysler 200 really pissed someone off!
"Yeah but you know about cars,you can identify the problem, what about us mortals? :("
Are you allowed in your country to wash a car just in the driveway?
"Random question, Is there a reason all of a sudden you've started covering up the Meguiars logo on stuff? You may have said something about this in the past but I couldn't find anything about it."
I like the info provided in your videos. I have a question. is a car ceramic coating spay (Mother's CMX as an example) give the same results as the little bottle of ceramic coating?
"Another good keyword search is ""turns over""."
"Unbelievable how you can wash a car with all the chemicals who flow into the normal water 32:41, which you and all your ppl later have to drink... In Europe, it's not allowed to wash and bring all these chemicals into normal water to protect the nature and  environment. For this you have to go into an official Car-Washing, where they separated the chemicals by filters."
Your explanation is realistic and straight to the point. l watch several video's on how to trade in the market but haven't made any headstart because they are either taIking some gibberish or sharing their story of how they made it. And l don't want to make mistakes by taking risks on my own. Can someone recommend a verified coach?
Tt
So what happened to repairing the battery?
Perfect ad placement
i would not buy this e trash^^

"Very nice video and nice work!
I have a 2014 Ford Escape with just at 40k miles on it that had previously belonged to a close relative who was the original owner and about 30k plus of the mileage has been since I got it. Due to health issues myself, I've not been able to clean it properly for awhile so It's pretty bad inside. I'm getting ready to redue some of the electronics including switching out cigarette lighter port for a USB power port setup  and since I'll have the console physically disassembled I'm going to try to clean it up a bit. While I'm not planning on selling it your cleaning tips will help so thank you!"
Yep. Subscribed
"Step 1)  Be a mechanic with over $20,000 in tools and knowledge.
Step 2)  Clean and fix a car that would cost a ton of money to fix and clean.

"Get yourself a cylinder leakage tester in that way you will be able to tell if it is the piston rings, leaking valves more than likely exhaust valves or head gasket then you will know what you are looking at before you remove the head? I never removed a cylinder head without doing the leakage test, then the customer did not get a big surprise when the head was removed also it will usual take one hour or more depending on how many cylinders and the difficulty in getting the spark plugs out and in. I never had a customer that gripped about the test when they were told what we were looking for, next write the entire test on paper and attache the test to the customers invoice. It pays to be Old School?"

"In most states you can only flip so many cars per year without a dealer license, how are you getting around that--or are you keeping it under the minimum number per year? I think here in Az it is 7 cars per year, but this in only if you are re-titling each one to your name first. May I ask are you re-titling these in your name, or just leaving the original persons name on the title until you re-sell it? ---Does anyone on here have any experience with doing this---thanks in advance?"

"Chris must make his parents proud, he has a great attitude and basic reasoning skills. The best to you Chris"
I miss that 3rd gen Prius trunk. I used to put the seats down and haul concrete blocks and lumber it it. The thing is actually really big. Works great as a beater hauler/commuter car.
"As someone who details, don't start with compound. It's aggressive and most of the time removes more clear coat then you need. Do a test patch on the most scratched up part and start with polish and soft foam. If it does nothing after a couple passes try compound."

"How to Buy a Car To Flip for a Profit

Step one: be a mechanic.........."
"The amount of time your repairs take are in no way worth the money you earn with this side hustle. Also you need quite much tools to do that kind of things, like a car that is being able to trailer, the tools to repair, the drive way and so on."
in america car turns on  - the guy oh this is awesome
ok how did you know there was sugar in the tank? is that something that was disclosed on the report when you bought it or did you perform a test?
Autotempest isn't bad but if I'm being honest I haven't seen a site better than facebook mareketplace.
Love this video and all of your videos. Might want folks to check their local laws as I believe it is illegal in many states to flip cars without having a dealership license.
"Sanding down your headlights is actually illegal here in Germany, because the light can be bend in a different angle, than it is supposed to do...."
"Hey Chris, for the headlights would you recommend the ceramic coating or clear coat? I've done the clear coat on one car and its been awesome, was thinking should I do the ceramic coating on the other. Thanks for the videos Chris they are amazing!"
"I have a question for you, how do you deal with the limit on selling vehicles as a private citizen? My state limits the cars I can sale to three per year without a dealer license."
been watching chris fix for years coolest guy
Sorry I would not recommend this to general public as a way of making additional cash. Way too risky and time consuming. You never know what could be the problem with the car . Effort for diagnosis and paying for the part and labor to fixing it doesn't worth it.
"me who paid 5000$ for a 2017 silverado and sold it for 15,00$. W gang. Auctions are great. paid 9000$ for a fully running Hummer"
"I mean I knew flipping a car wasn't easy. They're extremely heavy, so without special equipment, there's a good chance of injury trying to roll a car over.
Would you say the biggest cost of car repairs and such mostly comes from labor rather than the part costs?"
how do you deal with titles when flipping cars
"Ayy man i just want to ask couse you good with cars, do chrysler 300c part match on lancia thema 2014?"
In theory its nice. Not when you find out what else is all wrong with the piece of shit car you just got
"30 mpg is normal if you are not riding an amercian car ;)

"OMG, this second car needs ""head planning"". What you did is a waste of money. The next owner now has a problem."

why not just use the polisher to polish the lenses? It works just as well and is easier to do.
Detailing the engine bay is a bas sign. You do not know if it has oil leaks and so on.
"Once again, you never fail to amaze me. Very informative and detailed. Very nice video sir! Keep it up!!"
Idk if its okay :D but at 26:50 id use the brush to push the towel in a little

"When craigslist just came out-i was 20 yo and had couple years of car mechanic experience. I made good money of flipping civics, priuses was really expensive and not common. Everyone was looking for save on gas car. Only bought 4 door automatic, mechanic special. Detail it, paint bumper, change breaks or axle and resell for 1-1,5k profit in 7 days. Made good money, i was watching craigslist updates every 15 minutes so i be first to call to see a deal. Best season were when people bought newer car on tax season and was getting rid of old one(was always negotiable) but later alot smarties figured out what im doing and became too much competition and didnt worth time doing it anymore+people start asking car fax for 2-3k car lol."
I had a gen3 prius.. id rather go with the coolant at toyota. Bit pricier maybe 25 30 bucks gallon but it has the actual stuff needed. I remember comparing ay the time and yeah its recommended to use theirs. People have had problems later on with other brands. Something about the ions or something something in it. Anyway ypure better off.. for a prius hybrid ..buy at the dealer
"I mostly just clicked on this video because I had a random question. So I believe it was on Instagram like almost 2 years ago at this point but you said something about reviewing an ethanol content reader, any updates on this???"
What rust preventative paint do you use ?
how do you find cars like these
"12:33 export it to sweden for example, 7k dollar for a ram here is a barg for those, dont know what shipping would be tho xD"
4/32 is 1/8
How would you be able to tell if its worth taking the risk of buying car with bad headgasket? The engine block could be all warp. I just wanna know why you buy that second car
Hi I don't know if you will see this a month later. I am starting an LLC today and I will flip cars. Do you have a dealers license and do you suggest I get one before I start flipping?
unrealistic
"Man, what a great video LOL! Wow. How are you not at 50mil??"
46:11 lil Chris fix face reveal
"Best video I have ever seen on any subject,  Well done, my man."
"Hey Chris just wanted to say I love the videos as always! I also wanted to know if you know how to fix clear coat fade. My clear coat isn't peeling just yet but there's long white streaks on my car that could possibly be the clear coat, thank you in advance!"
"Tbh i would probably never flip cars but seeing these vehicles people want to get rid of be transformed into functioning, clean and ready to be used again vehicles is just so satisfying"
30 MPG is not something that we expact to see in UK. For Prius or Corolla with 4th gen hybrid system you expect to see 70 MPG. On my VW Tiguan with 1.5 TSI engine I am getting 42-45 MPG in everyday driving.
Don't forget the governments cut
That del sol was idling at 2k how much to fix that?
Amazing video! This has a milking potential of like 10 videos but you did everything in one! Amazing work!
"Don't expect to make profit on every car you ""flip"" -- just come out ahead overall -- you will lose money on some, you will breakeven on most, you will make money on some.  That's what these YouTubers and folks don't tell you.  There is no such thing as ""easy"" money - you have to work for it.  At least Chris doesn't hide the fact that he puts in substantial elbow grease to do this, so he's better than most."
I wish I was so handy and comfortable working on a car like you do. I would be saving tons of money  but I do not trust myself to even do the basics.
Hopefully the guy who vandalized the chrysler doesn't recgonise that car and do it again.
does a viper engine fit a del sol
@ChrisFix love your videos!!! I've been struggling to get around where I live and I don't make a lot of money yet and when I do get around I usually drive with my friends I feel bad for them driving me everywhere. I know this seems like a lot to ask but is it possible for you to get me a cheap car so I get get around with A to B and get it fixed the way you get them fixed. I love the way you work on these cars keep up the good work!!!
calm down
"I am in Africa , Kenya I need a car"
Nice!
"""I offered $2500, he came back at $3500, and we met in the middle at $2700."" Umm.. who gonna tell him..."
This video keeps me motivated to learn about cars. Never thought of learning on how to fix my car and detailing it without spending arm and a leg. A very well explained video enjoyed watching and learning at the same time tricks and techniques. Thank you
"You know the why I really like this channel! Besides the awesome flipping and fixing, he included multiple cars in one video instead of dragging them out over a bunch of videos trying to suck up as much views as possible! Thanks for this great content!"
16:38 What are these called and can they be used on most vehicles?  Would like to use this to check for potential head gasket leaks in my 90 Civic Si EF as well as my B7 Audi S4!
"I'm sure people say this all the time, but I love you bro!  As someone that didn't grow up with a father, or even a father figure,
I never really learned how to work on cars as a child.  I'm 39 years of age now, and I'm only just now starting to learn how to 
do more than just the basics like changing oil, spark plugs etc.  Watching your channel as well as a few other channels on 
YT has really helped me build up confidence to start building my 1990 Honda Civic EF Si Hatchback!  I really want to swap a
K20 or K24 engine into the car, but since I'm such a rookie when it comes to working on cars, I think I'll stick with a a B16 or
maybe a B20 instead since they're both much easier swaps to pull off.  Thanks for your channel!  I say it as though you don't
have 9+ million subs making a nice career off your content, but STILL!  THANKS!  I'd personally love to see you buy an older
EF Hatch like mine and work on that car!  Would be even more helpful for me!"
"damn, this isnt just a guide on how to flip a car, but how to get a decent car for a first time car buyer with not much money. I learned a lot from a video like this"
"Bro can I be your best friend, I just wanna learn everything I can from you. Badass brother."
The thing I respect most about the production is the time put in to making the exposure and hue the same for the before and afters
"America, you just give 300 bucks to the owner and you buy the car.
Europe, you pay 300 for the car, 200 for ownership transfer fees BUT first you have to make sure the car has passed technical survey, if not, recondition costs plus 50 euros for the cert and depending on engine displacement you also have to pay annual taxes otherwise transfer is not applicable."
Chris make one video repair air conditioner in car like replacing evaporator
It was perfect until you put those horrible plastic hub caps on. I would have just bought new mags or left it.. As soon as I see hub caps on a car it automatically seems cheap.
"You make it seem easy. 
If you try to do this where I live, you'll end up with an expensive rusty French car with complicated engine problems, and you'll lose your mind and a lot of money, as you'll make no profits! 
I wouldn't flip a car for profit in Algeria."
after cleaning the paint and waxing the car it really looks like Raytracing ON :D
where can i get that vaccum? 8:23
is that the guy your english cousin?
Should  buy a great condition 1980 Mercedes convertible 450sl for 6K and sell it for 12k ?
"@1:12 What the hell is ""Insruance Bill""?"
this is the fakest content ever
I love these videos!
I am supposed to be working but I am amazed at this. Just wow!!!!
ay chris fix is the master on fixing and chris fix knows every thing about cars and trucks
"this reminds me of an old saying: ""it's profitable if you don't value your time"""
"If someone wanted to buy a car from you, where would they go?"
the best car content creator ever bro. WHO MAKES A VIDEO TELLING US HOW 2 MAKE MONEY AND ALSO GIVES ALL THE MATERIAL FOR FREE?? the goat fr fr
i have been watching ever since i could remeber and i cant wait for del sol
I use your videos for Life Skills at Highlands Juvenile Detention Center.  The students love them.  We are trying to find the second part of your flipping the Prius.  Can you help us? Has it been posted.  Thanks for all you do.
"I guess all the people on fb marketplace with $600-$1,000 hondas have seen this video and brought the prices up"
Where your cost of title fees and taxes
"Always spend the extra money on a carfax, reason being is there is people not all, but they will dialback the odometers. Always do your research !! I flip cars to make extra money so try to learn from my mistakes"
Which app are you using to get abs etc?
What do you use for car shipping? I assume you have had to ship a car at some point off the site
I got a car for 350 one time like that.
"what type of soap you used for the soapy water, and what's the ratio?"
What kind of welding machine was it that was used on the exhaust ?
Where u get the parts bro
"ahhhh, my dash is too clean, imma crash!"
This is like deja Vu cause the guy next to me did the same thing with the exact same car and color and repaired using other Priuses from copart. ????
Your beard is hot
I wanna buy a chris fix car!
You make it look and sound easy.
What solution do you use for the extracted vacuum
All the way from Jamaica thanks for the info bro
"My guy, what did you do to know so much about cars? What classes did you take???"
I will never understand why this guy hides who he is
"I would pay 100$ extra for a car coming from chrisfix than from any other source. Frankly because the concern you have of replacing parts just so that next owner doesn't run into issues, is something money cannot buy. You are a brand in yourself."
wow u have amazing tools
Bro is a master at switching weapons.
What is a good hybrid truck?
So what grits of sandpaper do I need to paint the body of a car?
So satisfying to watch!!!
I thought more people could throw 400feet
When I do a job. I factor in new tools as well. They are always an extra cost. That can get you.
what do you use for the cleaning solution for the extractor vacuum?
Soapy water + Microfiber towel. I got it
Omg I love these flipping videos.
"great video but... anyone else wonder if he bought a car to spray paint and mud up just so he could clean it? its too convenient. everyone has keys in their pockets. what are the odds on somebody risking vandalising a car but stopping short of key scratches, kicks, brick through the window etc?"
"You don't even have to buy a car to do this, just offer detailing service"
Hi. Had a question I have a 2016 toyota camry it has 160k miles and the transmission fluid hasn't been changed. Should I change the fluid or no leave it? Thanks
chrisfix make a  turbo  vidoe
Respect ...amazing
"Wash it, clear the codes, lie then resell it, waste of time this is"
"Chris, when you're selling the cars, do you give 6 months warranty or do you just sell it as is? Do you put this into consideration?"
"@9:37 ""Does a viper engine fit in a del sol?"" LMAO <3"
"I can trade in a nissan pathfinder 2005 sport (137,000 miles) and pay the rest in cash. It's got a few problems but it'll make a heck of a video."
"Hey bro can I buy the Toyota, I need a car for college that doesn't burn alot of gas."
thank you for really breaking everything down for us man!
One thing you forgot to mention is use your location has an advantage i grew up were i live i know a lot of people that can give me good deals on stuff like windshields and transmissions but my area doesn't have a lot of junkyards so i avoid stuff that i cant find easily
"This content is Gold, I love it."
to polish this turd is like putting makeup on a pig
Do you think a 16 year old kid can legally do this?
The juxtaposition of a Prius in the same shot as a Hummer.
"Hey Chris, love your videos so much! Just a quick question, I live in Ontario and you can only sell about 5 cars every single year before you get fined for something called ""Curbsiding."" Is there some kind of way around that? Of course I doubt I will be able to flip 5 cars a year, but one day if I do get to that level, is there any way to bypass that 5 car limit, I believe you need a dealers license but for that I'm pretty sure you also will need some kind of used car dealership"
piece of sheet metal
"Would you mind telling us the approximate time it takes to do each task? Clay bar, etc"
"Chris, if you want to do this as a living, do you need a dealers license?"
"Is there anything you can't do, bruh?  Pretty impressive, especially for a young man."
Wow the paint correction was insane.
Awesome video (as usual)!  I followed the steps you showed to clear up my headlights and they look great!  Thanks!
Lmao....a part that is a couple of bucks gets it started
what tool did you use to cut the sheet metal on the floor of the delsol ?
"Cool! Thanks Chris. BTW, I noticed you used ceramic coating for the headlights instead of Rust-Oleum gloss clear spray paint as in the post 8 years ago. Is the ceramic coating better/last longer?"
"Chris has magic hands, if I did any of that it look worse."
This is the best hobby I could imagine
Love my Prius! :)
"1. Buy old cheap car.
2. Make a Youtube account. 
3. Film and upload the video
4. Wait it get enough views and generate revenue through ads. 
5. Be a Youtube parasite. 
That's it."
That's one of the best flips I've ever seen! Amazing.
"Hey Chris, I recently started watching your videos and from what I'm seeing and hearing, you're definetly very knowledgeable when it comes to cars and such, so I have a question I'm hoping you could answer for me.

I recently bought a 2017 Subaru BRZ, manual, was declared totaled but got fixed perfectly by the previous owner, who drove it for 2 years before reselling it. 
The car is in perfect shape, no apparent scratches etc. but there is one issue with it and after having the car checked out by many mechanics and other people who specialize in those cases, aswell as Subaru Canada (who has never had a case like this so they couldn't find it themselves), I'm really starting to lose hope in ever driving it myself.
Here's the issue implied up above: The car won't start unless you push the ""Start engine"" with the key fob. At first we thought it wasn't too bad, but it turns out, it also may stall the car at random moments. The other weird part about it is that it won't have that issue if you drove it a bit before, but if you leave it off for let's say one night, that same issue comes back. Someone said it may have something to do about Volts or something of the sort, as if somehow there was a ""Voltage leak"".

It's my first car that I will buy by myself so I was really excited to have it, as it is a very fun car but so far every attempt has been futile so if you or anyone has an idea or a fix, it would mean the world to me."
"incredible the way this guy pays attention to details, not only in his work but also in his videos, you saw that transition of the prius from the screen to the real life, like this details there are many in his videos, incredible dedication."
Am I the only one who thinks the wheels on the Prius actually look decent?
If you flip cars on a regular- When shopping for purchase take the VIN and call the OEM for any open recalls- There are times that the reason the person is getting rid of the car is covered by OEM warranty recall and you can get all the work done for free-
This might be the best YT video I have ever seen.
I can't remember the last time I found such an entertaining video on YouTube
You're awesome. I'm subbing bc I get bored after work and somehow it's satisfying seeing vehicle repairs at 10 pm lol
Maybe you can fix my car when I try to sneak out at night my car what makes a rattling noise
"i gre up watching chrisfix i love he's videos, always very specific, im glad to come back and see he's still doing great."
"instructions unclear, i covered my engine bay in ranch dressing"
Does anyone know what vacuum he is using? 24:12
Chris what is the Chevy a farm truck?
Need something like that website that find cars in Sweden
Can't wait for the turbo set up video
Good *****ing work
Chris is the GOAT
so first thing u need to flip a car is very strong arms and  u just flip it
Really enjoyed this video!
Mr. Before and After
I like using the turtle buffing compound to remove oxidation from paint and headlights. Great video
"An easier way to refinish the headlights is to use an oscillating tool with a thick cotton pad.  I use compound, then polish, and then a third go with plastic polish like you.  I seal with ceramic, too.  Very fast and easy."
"I don't own a car, I can't even drive, I have no interest in flipping cars....I watched all of this and enjoyed the hell out of it. Great vid."
"He forgot to mention that there is a limit as to how many vehicles you can selll, depending on which state you live in, unless you have a dealer's license. Also forgot to mention the capital gains tax you must pay on the gain (profit). Most important, he didn't mention that it is a FELONY in all 50 states to sell a car with a ""floated title"". That means that, unless you're a dealer, you must register the car in your name before you can sell it. If you buy a car from a non-dealer, always make them show you their ID and that it matches the name on the title. Otherwise, you're looking at prison time if you're caught. Thumbs down to this video."
Could use one of this for Ubereats...
That bracket was welded on top and bottom though.
"""mechanic special"""
IF ANYONE NEEDS PARTS IN socal ! HMU ill help you out ! work at a parts store in cali
didnt this guy scam people by rebrranding a cheap aliexpresss rachet?
Are you actually a fisherman??
I'd rather buy a car from this guy than any dealership.
"I definitely want to see the video you were talking about making about replacing the armrest fabric and cushions. That's something I need to do, myself.
Also if you have one for the headliner, I definitely need to do that as well."
Anyone know what this made on the dyno?
"""I like to see headgasket leaks as one of the problems"" *Subaru entered the chat*"
"Is it possible to sell the car at those prices you've mentioned, in USA, after fixing/cleaning it? Is it realistic? Im from Europe"
Many have come after this throne.....But there is only one King of the DIY auto community
Hold up did u replace the hybrid or not
does a viper engine fit in a del sol?
Is there a Australian version of that car website
what about bearing damage on the head gasket leaks?
Do you register the cars in your name as in a typical buy/sell or do you have specific licensing/permitting?
This is illegal in some states to buy and sell a car for the purpose of making a profit without a dealer license.
"Lol ""Morgage"" bill"
"ATD. Attention To Detail. This guy is on another level. Well informed, well narrated and prepared. Can't find many YouTubers who put this much work into compiling information for you and presents everything so smoothly. I mean he has a bottle of his brand labeled soapy wooder.

Dude, you deserve your own TV show."
This is dangerous when you going to the highway the brakes never stop
Why not buy a big garage and hire some employees? You could earn millions by just finding cars for your employees to fix
18:32 How do you get this view? with a Drone ?
All this equipment you are using gotta be worth 30.000$ at least..
"5:27 - Do you recommend sanding down the block to have an even surface on the block for the head gasket? Also, do you recommend torquing down to specs then retorque after a few days use or do you recommend torquing down to specs and do the + 45 + 45 turn to each bolt"
But what about having to pay the title fees and taxes on all the cars? That can cost a lot
"Love u Chris fix, but the title should be: How to flip a car before this video"
stop encouraging global warming
If only there were more Americans like you (and Joe Biden was not president) the US dollar wouldn't be going to hell right now...
Your voice greatly comforts me
34:02 its what
What about the hybrid battery and transmission???????
Wonder what the story was on the vandalized car
He will never do a face reveal but ive seen his face
How do you coordinate the voiceovers with the whole process of fixing the car and filming all att the same time?!
gdaaaamn I wish I had a garage so I could tinker with cars..
"Dude, this isn't a side hustle. Do this enough, and you can make well over 100 grand a year."
Grate video.   Thank you for it.  Quick question: What's the model of the welder you used in this video? Thank you
Working or not the del sol guy got finessed for $300
"Maybe it's just me but there's a little tickle in my brain everytime you say water, it sounds like war-ter"
Unless you've rebuilt engines and understand electrical systems you're better off getting a job.
"This isn't an engineering issue 100%, it's a labor operation issue. The operation should allow for that, and in many cases it doesn't.  If it pays for it, then you don't like what the job entails. 

The issue your talking about is where a guide should have been used as a guide. An estimate is not a quote. 

Yes a person who bought a car that costs 120k should expect a large bill to service many parts of that vehicle. 

If the shop misquoted a job, the shop should be responsible for paying the technician for lost time due to a misquoted time.

I worked for a Ford dealer before and had a cash door latch job to do which I had done a number of regulators under warranty on and been paid .7 for the regulator, well they quoted the latch at .6 which the regulator had to be removed to do the job. Knowing that and looking at the job before I started I brought it till the writers attention.  I was told to ""just get it done"". I rolled my box out of that shop."
"Don't use iron decon and a clay bar. Use iron decon to dissolve the iron and wash that off. then use a proper lub for clay bar. If you let iron decon dry on the car it damages the clear coat. Also, lub is cheaper than iron decon so you don't want to burn through your expensive iron decon just to clay the car. Lastly, if you're pulling out iron with the decon you're just filling up your clay bar way faster."
"Love your videos, where do you post your cars for sale??"
"Should check engine mounts, transmission mount and pushings...  Ibey the vibration on shutdown comes from there"
Chris does a better job than dkoldies
