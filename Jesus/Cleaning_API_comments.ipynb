I have the most FANTASTIC WHEEL CLEANER - its super gentle, PH balanced and does a superb job, but I freely admit you MUST keep up with brake dust. An open designed wheel where you can reach through to the back section of the wheel is also required, as a tight spoke setup like this would not be easy to clean. The magic cleaner? Car wash SOAP. ANY GOOD car wash soap (I like Mequiar's Ultimate Wash & Wax - the bright yellow one) -and I wash my wheels DAILY inside an out. I think that a cleaner that burns your skin off (not saying yours does or would - but some are really nasty and harsh) is probably NOT great if you wax your wheels once a month or so. I just never understood why people use these cleaners. SOAP removes all traces of brake dust, if you get in there with a sponge, cloth or soft brush. If you want to do it WITHOUT TOUCHING the wheel, well, that's your choice.
