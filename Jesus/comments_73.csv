"Is it just me or that stretchy ice really, really annoyed me by not being pulled up fast enough"
"02:28 - Yes, that's the cockpit. Without the info, i never would have known that ..."
Baby yoga? That dog looks like mini Dobby.
The really stretchy ice is actually just snow thats landed on a pond
What if the ice doesn't let you. Out one time
0:00 for a split second what was that noise?
The forbidden slurpee
"2:28 

Imagine there was an earthquake 


""Damn this is some bad turbulence"""
That guy who lives in a plane took his love for planes to a whole nother level
1:04 bro turned into the grinch

The House in the plane is the perfect flight simulator gaming setup
2:35 he broke physics
What did the cat do to go to the vet
God that plane house looks like my nightmare living space
2:40 if you are wondering where this is its Olu Deniz - Turkey

"*cat:* ""I think its about time I lost some cat weight"""
I wish the best for that ice's transition!
Everyone gangsta til his hand freezes into ice
"That cat, who got stuck in the chair, was so stressed, which stressed me out. Cats don't only purr when they are happy or content. They also purr as a coping mechanism to help them calm down in stressful situations."
0:17 that cat is a mega chonker
Why is no one talking about that cute lil dog at the end? He/she is so adorable!
Dude living in the plan will be living it up until the cannibals get curious
1:24 dobby
"Stretchy ice?  Everyone just... accepts that as normal?  Totally normal, like hazy skies dirty with crisscrossed lines?
  
Here's some tips, kids. Ice doesn't stretch unless it isn't actually ice. Condensation doesn't linger in place for half a day.  Truly this world is done for."
"How the heck did he just ""put"" the plain in the forest"
"Repent and put your trust in Jesus.
We've all sinned and deserve Hell.

0:43 *Loading Disk*
So nobody's gonna talk about the plane-house?
1:!0 audio probably added after
"Thiz purson found sums water....
That was right in the middle of transition to eeeeyyyyes"
Anyone else try to push their nose as far back as possible? No just me?
How does one get a plane in the middle of the forest with it intact
At least he didn't make fun of the cats weight and called the hole small
0:28 NOOO THAT'S NOT FUNNY!!!
Poor fat cat. That's not funny
"0:51
1:33"
Day 3 of asking for a shoutout
"To any of you confused on how the ice ""stretched""... It is due to when the outside temperature is colder than the water but the water is at freezing point and the hand displacing the water and being brought up causes instantaneous freezing due to movement and liquid displacement. This is similar to the really cold bottled water freezing upon impact.."
this is the first thing i watched on this channel what nostaliga
Is no one going to mention the airplane guy?
0:00 *Pop*
That time lapse video is excellent!! How cool it would be to that in person!!
1:00 PIG MAN
BABY YODA!? IT'S GROGU!
0:47 AWWWW
Its batman
"It never occurred to me that ships would travel close to each other, but it makes sense when you think about it, once a path is found to be the most efficient, the whole world (almost quite literally) would maximize it's usage"
0:50 he is so cute
The guy with the nose I can see the pimps
hes literally a bat
"Imagine hiking through the woods to find what you assume is a plane crash, only to learn a dude's been living in it for years."
the deer controlled his banana while teleporting it
Just so you know that plane was a Boeing 727
The fing cat LMAO
2:15 this man he has the calmest life i could imagine i would love to live like him

I dont know how water can do that! It's so cool!
"ok, but how did he get the plane in the forest?"
the dog looks like yodas father without teeth
legend says that cat is looking for the donut
0:32 panic sets in
"""This person bought an old plane, put it in the middle of the forest, and decided to make it his home."" I love the implication that 1) he didn't make the decision to live in it until AFTER it was placed, and 2) putting it in the forest wasn't a decision, like obviously that's what he was going to do."
"That cat going to the vet is speaking English
""Hewo? Hewo? HEWP! HEWP!"""
0:57 yooo its vecna
Yey pre covid days
"Will I ever get to see a night sky like that?
Sometimes,  I feel so sad because inspite of working so hard,  I can't afford to move into a country where night sky's like that.

0:44 that banana just teleported into the deers mouth lol
the waffle house has found it's new host
"1:03 one of my friends back in highschool could do this, he broke his nose like 15 times and he explained thats why he could do it"
The ice one is just a layer of ice / water with melted snow on it. I'm sorry if I'm wrong it's because I've seen this stuff on my pond but it wasn't stretchy ?
Bro the cat not in 4WD it in 2WD 0:20
props to some stretchy ice for being the most popular daily dose of internet video that isnt the 2019 best of the internet video
2:43 THATS WHERE I LIVE OMG LMAO I DID THE SAME THING BEFORE
0:42 he looks so happy after eating it xD
dude that cargo ship literally passed by my apartment's balcony in hong kong at 1:38 (see circular complex at the right - I live in one of those)
I think the guy without the nose might be Voldemort.
Dude the video is 3 minutes but it feels like 1 minute
0:44 put that on 0.25 speed. It literally teleports into his mouth
Legends say the cat is still trying to Fit in the hole
"it was my dream to do the ice thing

"She's just laughing at the cat mean while the cat is thinking in its  head  ""i swear help me ,  i will kill you in your sleep mom"""

My instincts when I see the 1st clip: *EAT IT*
"DO NOT believe those people who say you made a bad video!!! They have NO life and are very, very pathetic. Sad, sad people! You make the rest of us very, very happy!!!"
Those flashing lights wore bright

Big emphasis on tried for the cat
This narrator sounds like that cat Leafy.
Imagine picking up a girl. Then you suggest to go back to your place. She gets in your car. Then you take her to the middle of the woods to an abandoned broken plane.
2:08 be like : can i come round your house for a playdate? sure! but i dont have a house i have a plane!

People can make anything into a house.

THE DOG CLIP AT THE END OMG SO CUTEEEE

"At 0:45, I could have sworn that deer ate the banana piece at the speed of light it looks like it disappeared in a matter of milliseconds"
1:02 oh I guess I'm not the only one
0:34 cute cat lol
1:14 is the most British dog I've ever seen
"The deer looks so happy, very wholesome!"
"I legitimately feel really bad for that cat who couldn't fit through the chair.

(I use ""he"" as the pronouns for the cat just because my cats are male, I know it is a logical error but I digress)
  This means that he's overweight/overfed and has lost his ability to sense how big a space he can fit through (cats use their whiskers to determine this; if they become overweight, their whiskers lose their accuracy and their entire function). It's a shame."
Dreams be like when ur underwater and cant escape
You could call it stretchy ice or dense water
1:00 Feral Goul from Fallout
Did the last guy survive?
My mind: eat the ice
I would love to have a plane like that to ive in.

2:30"
the deer OMG

May the force be with *woof*
"2:04 meanwhile, dozens of millions people don't have a roof over their heads and/or are starving.

Eat the rich"
the cat was wholesome
"If the water was cold enough to freeze up at the time, that was very dangerous and foolish of him."
LOL
"Ah yes, he FOUND some water that was transitioning into ice. He just FOUND his swimming pool, randomly."
I've never seen a sky that clear!
Anyone else thought that the ice was so edible
Suddenly i have a big urge to be a cargo man
"That dog at the end, my dog only looked at me like that when it had done something wrong and was acting nonchalant"

"Everyone's talking about the deer, or the ice guy's accent, or the really cool time lapse, BUT WHAT ABOUT THE GUY WITH THE PARACHUTE DOING NEVERENDING VERTICAL 360s??????"
