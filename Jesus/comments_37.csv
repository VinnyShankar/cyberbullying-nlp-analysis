I'll scream it til the day I die..Christians are the worst people to ever exist..Anyone who would align themselves with a group that is known for such harm is equally as guilty by choosing to belong..If you didn't support it you would denounce it and leave the group..Nothing has harmed this world as much as Christianity
This is disgusting on so many levels.
'Any Parent who sends their kid to this camp after the convictions is negligent and irresponsible'... it's always negligent or irresponsible. Nothing more. That may be why this continues......
surely spelling camp with a k should have been a clue
Everyone failed here  sad
What is aim any success have you received
This camp needs to be closed. Period.
This place is STILL operating and has a YouTube channel! Get this place shut down...
"As a Christian... these people are not Christian. This is EVIL in action. The fact that these events still happen are AWFUL. I never trust mega Christian organizations like this for these reasons. Not only are they cringey, but dangerous. Absolutely awful and just blood boiling. Shut this DOWN!"
Evangelicals are the real groomers.
These are the same right wing Christians who hates gay and drags but sleep with little boys. Another reason why i love God but hate churches
Fake Christians cherry-picking with morality and now ethics/legality. People like this make me feel confident in having left the Church. SMH.
The morality of the church strikes again.
YB Better
That's awful. My camp experiences were positive. It wasnt the one depicted here tho.
sick
Slave religions produce many predators
This sucks - this is where I live in Branson - this story made the whole community sick to our stomachs- reprehensible - horrible - what these sickos put these kids thru
"""Why are so many young people leaving the church?""
What young people have experienced:"
The Owner/Founder Family the White's is the NEXT #MURDAUGH family to go down I guarantee it!
"more parents should remember 2A, defend children"
"I hate these christian organizations who either believe they are ""holier than thou"" or are just frauds masquerading themselves. Kanakuk leadership ain't quitting - I tell you why: it's all about the money $$$. These folks are making tons of money riding on the coats of a religion."
"Crazy thing is I went to this camp 3 summers in a row, you could tell some of the counselors were alil too quick to have one on ones!"
"I went to the 7 day camp. We were forced to swim in really cold water and it was 50F outside, they kind of have a fear tactic mentality, and if you were late to kitchen duty you were forced to lunges and forced to shower with other kids in a tiny shower."
Kanakuk was the worst camp ever
So no one's taking the blame but Newman....what!!! All churches are corrupt.  Pray at home Love your God not theirs. They made it seem like it was a mistake foh! 60kids 60. Innocent children.  All of you scumbags in Power Count your Blessing. Count your f. Blessings.
"Thanks for bringing this story to light but this interviewer girl is the worst. No facial expressions, so forced"
Religion is poison. The founding fathers knew it.
Any parent who actually watched or heard this Newman preach and trusted there kid to hang out with him should be mentally evaluated
Someone getting abused at Christian summercamp why does that not surprise me?
"Yet, these same ""good christian folks"" .. attack drag queens reading stories in libraries, in plain sight of the public. Despicable hypocrites who 100% ignore the teachings of Christ."
"Camp leadership is DISGUSTING!. ""Immature Behavior"" Are you kidding me? It was ABUSE!!!"
In Joe White's deposition he looks like an a monster wearing human skin to try and blend in.
Hot tub bibe study that's some next level script for porno.
I have great memories of Christian camp now I'm scared. I hope to the gods that they are punished fairly.
Why isnt death sentence still a thing?
why does the anonymous dude with his hair put up look and sound like samuraiguitarist
What a sweet soul that boy is. Wishing him the absolute best
His smile at 8:35 shows everything. Sinister
Religion was the original scam and then they hide behind their piety or ask for forgiveness. Give it up people
I honestly can't say I'm surprised...
Yet this far right Christians attack LGBT people claiming they are sexual predators when they have predators in their mist that they protect
Christianity has gone
why is this camp still open?????? Disgusting
Survivors...how many dead were there?
"Come to kanukuk where we abuse your children then make you sign an NDA where you can't talk about it. And if you don't sign, we sue you into financial ruins"
"My heart stopped when I read this title in my feed.  I'm a survivor of sexual abuse at a Christian summer retreat, however it was by my own youth pastor. I was being abused in the mornings, missing the morning devotionals and when I did attend the woman who held the class treated me as delinquent I assume for poor attendance.  No one bothered to ask me what was going on. I spoke up while on the trip and I faced a backlash immediately from leaders of my own church and the camp. Luckily, law enforcement back in my home state of Florida was open to listening to me and took action. Justice was served as the man who assaulted me and other friends of mine who were members of the church was imprisoned for life.  I never took civil action which I regret because these adults were liable for allowing this to happen and calling me a liar when I came forward.  But after hearing this had i taken settlement money I wouldn't be able to use my voice to speak out against this horror."
"What happened there had nothing to do with Christianity.                   It was a sin.  Vice News go after what the Muslims do.             
      Vice News is just biased which equals fake news. v.                     It's gutless really."
To do such evil in the name of God is truly an atrocity
Sexual abuse is not Christian. Anyone perpetuating these crimes needs to be kicked out of the church.
Someome go to the jail and show everyone his record. That will do it.
Thought the thumbnail was Arin from Game Grumps
"""well, we didn't fire him for abusing children because we just thought it was an immature decision and wanted to help him.."".......WHAT IN THE EVER LIVING HECK. ARE THEY ALL INSANE?  like do you have brain damage? unbelievable...ALL of those people could have fired him and kept him on staff!!!!! sick and evil!!!! they should all be in jail!!!!!! .... the lawyers and judge REALLY failed here. wow. I have no idea what is wrong with the legal system its such a disgusting joke. and the lawyers who worked for the camp who buried them in paperwork can rot in the 7th level of hell."
This makes me so upset because these boys often grow up to become homosexuals.
"""that guy was abusing kids but otherwise he was such a great guy""...people said that about Jeffrey Epstein too"
Thank you young man for your courage
"I looked this place up bc I live in Missouri and went to church camp as a kid (not here, thankfully). They REALLY love the letter ""K"". To the point where they refer to ""Kounselors"" and ""Kampers."" It only gets more suspicious when you see that they were founded in 1926.

The Yelp reviews are f-----g terrifying. Several people talk about the ""cult-like"" atmosphere. And the Kamp motto that says to put others before yourself (not necessarily bad, but dangerous without boundaries as well). The bullying. The secret luggage searches. Then there's this: 

""[T]he nudity was just weird. They made us boys walk naked from our tee pee to the showers and we all were crammed in the showers together, the counselors would shower naked with us too, very inappropriate. My counselor would even walk around the tee pee naked, for no reason.""

Sounds like pedophile heaven."
"I can't believe how they described Newman's actions as ""immature behavior"" and tried to downplay it! They were talking about his nude four-wheeling and nude basketball playing with children!"
I love how VICE news always attacks people of the Christian Faith. There have been scandals in Christian churches don't get me wrong but there are other institutions in other faiths that commit a lot of abuse as well.
"SHUT KANAKUK DOWN..there's a special place in death, for those who (sexually) abuse kids ..& those who protect the abusers or are complicit."
Why did your lord not intervene?
What is even worse is you have Republican politicians who are willing to say that religious institutions to do this should have the right to hire these pedophiles back.
Bill Clinton??? Bill FUCKING CLINTON??? Seriously??? Bill had a heterosexual encounter with a consensual ADULT. God these christians are disgusting.
I'm pretty sure God Himself wouldn't allow this camp to stand if He came to earth right now.
Newman could spend less on Botox/social procedures
Prob the closeted gays that get the brunt of it all. So sad
These are actors.
Reminds me of It Takes Two
I don't know where this took place but I remember going to a church camp as a kid (had to be around 1998 or 2003) and I dont remember the place but I remember they had one of those large things that one person would jump on and it would launch the other person into the air and we where told that a kid the previous summer drowned...
Went to this camp in 70s.  Loved it but it felt cultish.
I went to Christian summer camps as a kid and thank god nothing like that happened to me there.
"imagine your child was sexually abused, and you have to pay 40 thousand dollars just to defend yourself from the organisation where it happened"
The people with lisps in this are making this too annoying to sit through
"10:36 

*Does the bare minimum to keep him anonymous* 
Vice protect your sources better."
The world would be peaceful without religion
Lotssnofnwoke pedohile camps supporting racost black supremacy popping up mow that are way worse then this
"I know that the justice system requires that everyone, no matter who they are, have competent legal representation, but what kind of absolute swine would willingly defend the camp?"
"funny how they water down what he did by saying inappropriate...no it wasn't just inappropriate, it was criminal"
"That's weird, there's no drag queens here. I was told multiple time that it's only drag queens who molest children."
"I went to this camp and it was the most incredible experience of my life. This is disgusting that people are portraying this camp as a bad place. It's just because they're Christian and there is a war on Christianity.  Contact me if you need to carry out a ""green light"" on anyone leading the political Sabatoge of this camp."
"Is it terrible to save the money and keep your children home? Will it kill the parents to have their children home? I blame the parents!

In such large groups even the children can assault others. Pedophiles always work where they can access their victims."
Powerfully done . Important journalism.
Further proof that Christianity and its offshoots are inherently evil and should be seen as a cancer to society.
"This is so disturbing on so many levels. Any type of sexual assault is a perpetual sentence for the victims, affecting every relationship the victim will have. I'm so sorry for the victims."
"THATS WHY YOU FOLLOW JESUS NOT SOME WORLDY CAMP... HE WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU OR FORSAKE YOU AND WILL HEAL YOU TRANSFORM YOU AND DELIVER YOU FROM YOUR SIN! AND YOU WILL BECOME A NEW CREATION IN CHRIST JESUS!! THESE PPL AT THE CAMP ARE OBVIOUSLY NOT ""OF CHRIST""(CHRISTIAN) CAUSE THE BIBLE OR JESUS DOESNT SAY TO DO SUCH THINGS AND JESUS SAID YOU WILL KNOW REAL CHRISTIANS BY THEIR FRUIT AND THIS CAMP BEARS BAD FRUIT!"
That leadership is the US government
"Never trust any church,camp, or church camps these people are wolves in sheep clothing they are predators not protectors."
The christians i know would never do this? What is it with these christian schools and camps?
"Dear God, Why did you let pete Newman molest your innocent children?"
"Dear God, Take care  of Joe White hold him accountable for his abuse against your children  . Dear God do you hear? Dear God , why did you let this happen.   Did your son die on the cross for Joe White?"
60 CHILDREN
One in Oklahoma
Republicans sick playground.
Blame the parents
"I grew up going to Kanakuk, during the time period this was happening at Kanakuk. I will not send my children to Kanakuk for any reason. My heart hurts for the victims. They deserve to speak out."
"As they say Evil hides in plain daylight.
I hope this kids are ok makes me so angry to hear a man will do this things to kids. It messes kids up specially as they grow up it awaken demons and makes them confused about their sensuality and makes them insecure this man needs to get as he deserves yet nothing on this earth will ever be enough."
Nasty Camp
Why do they use Jesus as a way to make money when Jesus was against money.  Every time I went to Red Rocks camp it was free.
Ahhh yes!! that's Christian Love.
Joe White is still heading over the camp. So who are the horrible parents still sending their children to this camp?
This is typical christian behavior. What lie this religion is.
This is a surprise because - why?
you guys should do a story on WOFF word of faith fellowship if you havent
"But Vice openly supports pedophilia...oh, i get it, it's an anti Christian piece..."
That f***** better never come to Colorado because that will be one dead child molester
"Most churches are lgbtq friendly now get use it, bigots"
"Plot twist. These people in leadership at the camp aren't real biblical Christians, probably don't even know what Jesus says about being one. They hide behind the word. So sad."
God bless the children-shame on those adults
Can confirm that a lot of churches who call themselves Christian behave like this.
That's terrible. Most kids have wonderful Christian camp experiences. My brothers & I had a great time. The people operating & covering it up are responsible for that evil man hurting kids.
I just want to say that most Christians are not evil. That what happened at this camp should have never happened. They will pay for what they did one day. Even if it's only in death.
"So this child rapist got life? Good, now can we get life sentences for all the other sickos who prey on children?"
The face of religion.
"All organised religion is evil. 
It has never been anything more than a snare to allow predators  to prey on the gullible, the indoctrinated,  the vulnerable."
Oh you guys mean Bohemian Grove?
"Hopefully no one is surprised about this as ALL RELIGIONS AND DENOMINATIONS have issues with sexual abuse towards children and women. 
From priest and nuns to pastors, reverend's, minister's, elders, rabbi's, etcetera. It also a trusted  member of the congregation too that hide, look for thier next victim.
Religious people are sooo brainwashed that they don't realize that this is happening.
The support pedophilia and believe in magic mythology."
"So far I'm only like 3 and a half minutes in, but let me say this ASHTON, idk if you know what you have done here sweet boy, by coming forward, but you have opened the gates for more young men to come forward... And women... But because of you, you are opening the door to de-stigmatize SA in both men and women. And historically it's been even harder for young men to come forward. I am so grateful for you, being a warrior in this fight. Coming forward and being public with your story! I admire you! Thank you for speaking up, for being a voice. For sharing your story! You are amazing."
"HELLO, christian was your first extremely obvious clue stupid but I know even stupider parents shove these lowlife money grubbing shifters down your throat n tell you their good! Hope you learned something at least. Grow up n thank God for lesson"
Guater Himmi!
"this is where, if i'm running the town, and this camp is in my area, i will definitely, shut down the entire system and whoever started this camp and whoever work in this camp, can never open another camp any shape or form, and will be investigated until not found guilty. The camp definitely knew. Feel so sad, and i hope justice prevail. If i were the victims, i would start to find and gather all the victims, and voice out on the view. Voice out on netflix documentary. Voice out, and keep on finding ways to make sure the camp is demolish. Remember Paris Hilton was abused as a child, at a place where the parent thought its suppose to help trouble teen and its not the case. God bless her soul she came out ok, but how many didn't? I hope and really really hope, something will just chop the head of the camp and shut it down."
Jesus said put on the full armor of God.  Trust no one.  Not everyone is connected to God!!!! Their connected to their own titles.  Protect your children by being there.. Don't allow someone else to entrust or think their going to care about your kids.  No matter how much money you pay for their protction!
"I went to a Jewish camp, Moshava, when I was 15. There was nothing wrong with the staff, but the kids were nasty. They were all spoiled kids from wealthy families. They either went so they could rebel against conservative Jewish customs, or because their parents wanted to be rid of them for the summer."
Why does this World continue to allow Religion at all. It is all nothing short of a Mind Virus responsible for more abuse and deaths than Cancer. Their Leaders are insane with serious psychological issues.
"9:00 He was so nice most of the time so I didn't report him for aping a few kids... he was such a good role model to so many of the other kids... so let him just be a bit immature and ape kids...

Tf that weasel looking guy was on"
Anyone who gives this idiotic death cult and its perverted advocates the time of day should have their head examined. You see the religion itself is the cause of the perversion.
"Jesus said, what you do to one of these little ones you have don this to me"
Joe White looks like he is possessed in his deposition.
Im sorry but as soon as you are found out to be molesting kids any credibility and past behavior needs to get thrown out the window. We aren't talking about an alcohol problem or issues with temper.
"I went to this camp. I begged to go and my parents sent me for one session. Guess what? One of the leaders groped me. This was in the 1980s; it's been going on for YEARS. 
This camp should be shut down."
Jesus freaks are usually hiding something.
Religion is a poison. It makes good and honest people say and do grotesques things.
"It's not just Xian summer camps where children are abused, it also takes place on church busses and in church itself.  After being forced to go to a Xian church camp at 12, I was grabbed by a preacher/counselor, pinned to the floor where he began to wail on me.  I managed to escape serious injury by getting away .... All because I ignored something he told me to do."
"Any southern evangelical church is nothing but a pit of child molesters. If they could track it the amount of abuse by older southern evangelical ""preacher"" and ""youth ministers"" would make the whole priest thing seem like a blip in the radar.  Religion is a scam for money, sex and power and it works.  Dont be a victim educate yourself on the truth of what organized religion is"
"That kind of stuff is very sad. 
Archangel Micheal"
so sorry for you all just unforgivable
Vsaush in the thumbnail
Learn about the Jesuit order.
Religion is mental illness.
There is a special place in hell for those who pose as Christian but worse of all harm children and lie about it.
Paedos are EVERYWHERE dont leave ur kids with strangers
Basically spread the word no kids no camp.
Average Christains
"""Missed the warning signs?!?"" *THEY FCKING TOLD YOU IT WAS HAPPENING, OVER AND OVER AGAIN!!*"
"Jesus never said anything about going to a summer camp. That's the first scam, people have to stop throwing Christian on things especially if it comes with a price tag."
How is a law enforcement agency not investigating this?
And how many children did he assault (really R) after they chose not to believe the girl and her mother that came forward?
"This is what you call a open pedophile ring, within the dominant society."
"This is so alarming and so is the fact that the camp is still in business. As a Christian myself, I am always leery of businesses advertising as Christian-owned because they are no better than any other sometimes."
These people are way to nice religious people are sheep.
Just more proof that God works in mysterious and sometimes perverted ways.
"But remember, the drag shows are the real threat. /S"
Religion is being used for divided and conquer...
Great job you christian maufukas
Sounds like a freemason camp
religion is the biggest crime in human history its man made thats why us millennials & gen z hate the church
Poor judgment I mean the guy was f****** kids in the ass what the f*** man poor judgment I mean how do you confuse a young child's a****** for a woman over the age of 18
"When setting around the fire in HELL, all thoughts who knew this was happening can try THAT lame excuse and see how much water that holds. For a judge to say that the camp didn't benefit from keeping the truth about the sexual abuse quiet. Right! and men can have BABIES. Money and power, say ""Hell-o to Jeffery E. when you see him."
"Wow, they're calling the act of molesting children as ""immature"" rather than ""the most vile and evil act known to mankind.""

Religion sure is something..."
"Things one can be certain of, where you have a religious organization, you will have child sexual abuse. Another thing you can be certain of, where you have child sexual abuse and you will, you'll find that religious outfit engaging in cover-up. Where you have children, you will have pedophiles, where those children are involved in any way with a religious outfit, you will have more  child sexual abuse and more coverups."
Getting bummed at Bible camp is to be expected let's be honest. Who tf is stupid enough to send they kids here ha ha
It is absolutely disgusting that people can hide behind religion to to molest children. And these types of places stay in business
"These are the real Groomers ,always have and always will be"
The biggest scam in the world is religion.
OH LORD!!!!!
Sounds like an adult cult that gets off on abuse and sexually misbehaving with children in the guise that they are a Christian camp. Jesus would have never aloud this.
Blows my mind that anyone can still be a Christian knowing fully how overrun with pedophiles the whole religion is and the lengths they'll go to just to protect the pedophiles in the church.
"Anyone that trusts the church for any reason, is a moron."
"I was mentally and physically abused by a female teacher in a Christian school when I was in 2nd grade. I told my two good friends there at the time. And instead they tell the teacher and principle which sent into punishment. 
  Now people tell me ""And that's why you don't believe in God anymore."" And I say ""God didn't force the hand of this woman to hurt me. She chose that.""  She then was fired and a week later hired at a public school.
  My anger really was from when I actually spoke up about the situation, like a plead for help. I then was turned in. And punished."
"I grew up in Overland Park and attended Holy Spirit catholic school. From 2011-2012 I was emotionally abused by the principal, Michele Watson and the Nun, Sister Petra. I had undiagnosed Adhd and would get overwhelmed by complex directions and info. My working memory would time out and I'd have to try to remember what I heard and then that would time out. I'd get bored, restless, frustrated, and angry and drew to ease the anxiety. But when I couldn't stop drawing, they called the principal, Mrs. Watson. 

She would put her face up to mine and scream, ""ISABELLE MYZER! LOOK AT ME. DON'T YOU EVER DO THAT AGAIN! DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?!"" and then she'd smirk when she made me cry and sometimes tried to make me mad in front of people, so I'd look bad. One day after I was done drawing, and actually o task, she showed up an hour later and put her mouth up to my ear and said, ""I know what you did..."" She also took my picture when I was mad just to harrase me and when I confronted her and asked why she did it, she said, ""because I'm the principal and I'm allowed."" she pretended to be nice one day. I was talking about butterflies with her, and she was being so friendly. But later that week she banned me from a field trip because she thought I'd look for caterpillars and she made my teacher be the one to tell my mom WITHOUT mentioning it was her decision.  She used and bullied at least a quarter of the people at the school whether it be students or teachers. She and sister petra were cruel to someone I was very close with as well. Mrs. Watson spread rumors about the resource teacher and turned all the teachers against her. Sister petra would block her doorway so she couldn't go to lunch and verbally abuse her. 

As for what sister Petra did to me, it almost got physical. I was arguing over taking a longer drink break with my para and Sister Petra came charging up to me and screamed, ""YOU'RE SO FULL OF HATE!"" a friendly teacher thankfully came to my aid and said, ""Come on isabelle, this doesn't look like a good situation."" Sister Petra has physically abused students, so I kknow she would have hurt me. During lunch one day, she had called jr.high students for seconds and thirds and said, ""No running"" and when they didn't listen, she screamed, ""I SAID NO RUNNING!"" and then they continued to run and she screamed, ""DON'T YOU DARE RUN OR I'M GONNA TRIP YOU!"" and lunged forward, tripping two 7th graders. 

my friend's mom went to the priest about the abuse, and he did nothing. The archbishop never listened either. Plenty of teachers, community members, parents and students minimized everything that happened and tried to side with her or cover for her. Almost no one stood up to them due to blackmail and intimidation. Sister Petra got away with it. She had a stroke a few years ago and got moved to a convent for sick nuns. Mrs. Watson got fired last year because the new Priest was concerned about the low enrollment, which had been a problem for a while. 

People still blame me, minimize what happened and some don't believe me. It's stupid how blind people choose to be. You want to be blind, and then it happens to you and then you just can't be."
Awesome another reason religion is a joke and a lie for monsters to hide behind.
"""inappropriate behavior."" Call it what it is - sexually predatory behavior. Grooming behavior. ILLEGAL BEHAVIOR. How about even ""immoral behavior"" shouldn't you be able to say that Mr. Camp Official? That's your whole area of study, what's Godly and what's moral, and if you don't know what that is maybe you ought not to be running a child molestation cover up and calling it a ""Christian Camp."" Matthew 18:6"
"Anyone who has ever encountered Jesus Christ and God's love would never do these kinds of things 
The Lord transforms hearts, not just modifies behaviour 

Anyone doing those things are clearly serving Satan, the abuser, manipulator and liar"
"I feel your  pain guys! I was 5 when my asexual  abuse  started, it went on  for years. With theghts on my life, and of my family's  too!  My heart goes out to all of you, Please  seek help ! UNLIKE me nearing  62 yoa. And an Alcoholic, still haunted.All my love!"
"Stay away from organized religions that put the church above the parishioners!
Evidence that El Diablo has entered the churches and just look into the history of Residential Schools!"
I assume they glossed over sin in the sermons considering they were doing a crime debatable to be worse than murder or on par with it
There's me in the corner losing my religion
I hate this interviewers demeanor; like shes getting off on it
Christian summer camp sounds like it your fault for even going pffffahaahahahahaha christian summer camp
"Throwing in a lil ""Joe Biden"" for reasons it happened instead of realizing that the christian institution as a whole has proliferated this for stacks of generations. Let's go brandon tho amirite?"
I live right down the road from there
"Can't believe that not one person talked about closing the camp down, what's this world come to"
Look at Joe white you know he touches kids look at him I can't believe this poor kids bless them you can looking at Joe white and the other camp workers I could and would never leave my or any other child at that camp parents are to blame as well
"Why woudn't  parents take their kids camping themselves, wow what  a concept!"
There's no Jesus there's something greater then us but nothing like what they say people are a joke
Parents fault and everyone who works for the camp
Religon needs to be banned and outlawed here in america religon is always causing problems.
I don't even know who would attend a summer camp anyway
"Disgusting behavior from the camp,purely despicable that they claim no fault!!"
"Wow!!!! Cooper is being stupid. He actually smiled. Oh my, so glad I never sent my kids there."
"Pedophiles are all over the place. Even more so now. And the religions are allowing, condoning, and colluding with the pedos."
"""Religion makes people over sexed."" -------  Father Greeley in an interview with Time Magazine."
Religions are cults
"I am an adult male, and just stay TF away from religious people.

Last year, during this time (winter). I was riding the bus, and when I got off I was followed by a man that was preaching the gospel out loud in the bus... Telling everyone ""God bless you"".

The SOB wanted to have sex with me, and sometimes I saw him with his wife."
"Native Pilipinos experienced even worst.
They got raped and killed like nothing happened."
This is nothing new. Happens all the time.
"This kinda stuff is a special kind of evil, under the guise of spirituality and growth there is nothing but abuse and molestation,  absolutely disgraceful disgusting evil behavior!"
"Child abuse is the ""gift"" that keeps on giving. To abuse a child is to kill their soul."
Nothing says Vote GOP like covering up molestations of children.. this is what you get when you have Marjorie Taylor green and her pro Christian nationalism lifestyle
Wth?! Disgusting!!
You cant fix something you intentionally suppress
"Creepy, joe whites voice is deep...it sounds like a demon speaking"
Joe White looks like a demon.
"He had oustanding character, and set an example, being a role model.   Yeah, he diddled a couple kids.   But, but, but, that character he has!!"
"if u read the bible for yourself u would be shocked to see so many religious organizations but then you would rememebr about satan and that he OBVIOUSLY would do this as  is the best way to deter people from reading the word of god for themselves quite clever really,  not to mention placing different wording/names/imagery over litersally everything and alwayas being aware of what we forget when we rememeber 

not to mention a organization of strangers from different familys is abasically just a group of bandits who u just trust with your kids like a bunch of psychos 

if you abide by the word of god you DONT fall into sin in such a lustful way that u need drag another human down with you 
pipitful and weak
vengance is gods for humans cannot punish in the same likeness as he"
A lot of weirdos hide behind religion.
Believing a flying sky god listens to your thoughts is one thing.  Forcing children to believe your fairy tales should be considered child abuse.  These people fit the exact definition of psychotic.
White looks like a new version of the Killer from Halloween.
Joe White carrying a cross portraying Jesus really disgusted me
"Seems like these kids got exactly the ""kamp"" experience they paid for.  They, by their own complaints, spent thousands of dollars to send their sons to a Christian ""kamp"" in freaking Missouri.  Of course there are so many innocent victims!
Was the wine weekend with the girls worth it?  Certainly not for the kids.  The parents, some of which kept sending their kids right back to their abuser for summer breaks, seem to not care as much as living parents should.
Until money showed up, of course.  We're welfare recipients, and no amount of money would buy our silence if, God forbid, this were our child.
But, we're not the kind of parents that need a vacation from the lives we chose to create."
Religion poisons everything
It's a cult
I'd rather send my child to a non religious camp. I always got creepy vibes in the church. I never understood why some adults were overly into hanging out with youth. Now I know as an adult. My senses were always on guard.
This camp is still freaking open. A new article was just released that there are over 100 victims and 30 perpetrators.
Honesty deal with it instead of being a total victim poor u. Honestly how hasn't been abused plus religious camp come on really it's like having ya kid in scouts of gym class and expecting that they won't be abused they will be abused and thing is the law doesn't give a dam and neither does religious leaders give a dam ... Parents should be accountable religion is a mental illness no difference to believing in unicorns or fairies.. the father's if abused kids should man up and serve justice themselfs if they don't then they never really gave a hoot about there kids.
There is no hate like Christian love.
Obviously they're NOT TRUE CHRISTIANS.
This is no different from the evangelicals who still support Trump and thinks the guy is a holy man.
"When I was at Kanakuk I had panic attacks every night due to massive headaches. The camp would not allow me to call home. Eventually they took me to the hospital and I got an MRI. I was diagnosed with a concussion. 
So there I am at a freaking HOSPITAL only with camp counselors and someone who I assumed was part of camp leadership, and they still WOULD NOT let me call home.
When Kanakuk called my mom to let her know her daughter was in the hospital with a concussion, my mom requested to talk to me and Kanakuk refused to let her talk to her daughter in the hospital! WTF??!
It was such a creepy, controlling environment and I have no doubt they would shame victims of abuse under the guise of the abused having a ""lack of faith.""
Joe White is a creep. He spoke to me 1:1 after I returned from the hospital and all he wanted to talk about was how worried he was for my faith. It was cringe-y and I remember feeling so uncomfortable having to sit and talk alone with this rich old dude who I had no relationship with about my spiritual health.
Something seemed so off about the leadership. My camp counselors were great but they were just a few years older than me. You could tell something just wasn't right. 
This camp is a dangerous breeding ground for abuse. Just ask the question.. Why wouldn't they condemn the situation immediately and fire this person? There's a reason they kept this creep around."
Its terrifying that there are so many horrific sick people out there. It sure seems to be more prevalent in these holier than thou evangelical communities.  I wonder if the religion is a cause of if its just a convenient place for these human scum.
"Joe and Brandon Alarcon, the only parents of an abused child from Camp Kanakuk are EXTREMELY BRAVE COURAGEOUS PRINCIPLED people! Without signing a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) they had a much smaller settlement. On top of it all they were sued for not signing an NDA and spent an additional $40,000 to defend the right to not sign an NDA. Please tell me how many people you know who would sacrifice that much to protect other people's kids? God Bless the Alarcon family! Shame on Camp Kanakuk!!! DON'T SEND YOUR KIDS THERE!"
There are people who will take the name of Jesus but they are wolfs. Jesus Christ will come and deal with these people.
This camp should be permanently shut down.
I remember when steve bannon media (voris' cm) kept trolling the Catholic leadership after the pope called to care for refugees.  But I haven't heard a peep from right wing media criticizing this.
The word happy comes from the word happen.
The human heart and the human brain each have their own memories.
Every knee will bow & every tongue will confess that Jesus is Lord. Bible prophecies are continuing to be fulfilled. God is love. God is glorious. God hates sin. Life and love are miracles from God each day.
Went to Kanakuk for 4 years and never seen or heard anything like this. Had the absolute time of my life there. Sad to hear :(
"This is what most religious camps are, a hideout for child predators. The dude that ran that camp should be arrested and charged as well"
"And this is an evangelical Christian camp,  just like a cult or catholic  choir Boys camp. This is not Jesus  teachings,  it's a cult  like all religion, you don't  need  religion  to control  your life and who for you to vote  for, just be spiritual,  love, kindness, compassion, and understanding. Period."
"Textbook christian behavior. Hey where are all the ""good"" christians beating the door down and demanding these ""not true christians""  cease to run a camp or publicly make amends? Crickets....."
How can we help destroy this sexual assault camp?
Reasons i left Christianity was because of the torment they did to me for being born autistic
"How about Kanakuk ""confess, repent, and make amends.""  You know, Christianity 101.   But oh yeah, they are an American organization, so deny, deny, deny....."
"Dear little Red Riding Hood:

Things have changed since you last walk through the forest: the big bad wolf is still very present, but has extended his territory to cities and has connections globally as well. Places facing dragons in the past, are now dealing directly with him. The major difference is that those beasts hide under sheep skin: they are not just multiplying but attack as well under the cover of wOke: some witchcraft has been required to create this wokeness without fire to expand territorial invasion. As soon as you wake up, practice wOking out as a defence: this involves growing the confidence to only follow strangers after investigation (""do not follow strangers"" is mom's best advice), play with more and more confidence where you feel you belong (in your playpen). It may not be as easy as in the past to fill up your basket when visiting rallies, but walking alone is to be avoided while to think alone is to be promoted. Gradually we should figure out where the games end and reality starts: some grown ups have not hatched out of fairy tales."
Anyone else believe the ppl in charge of this camp were involved with the abuse as well??
"Sueing victims into silence  IS A CRIME !!!
Criminal neglect followed by harassment that destroys lives and souls is SATANIC"
"U can't protect pedophiles, that alone is a crime."
Camp neglect ....yes !!!
"Now, there's a way to heal, because ""the criminal is a criminal"" and ""the offence a offence"" and there are no immature filthy that might abuse anywhere atleast now...  Truth alone is worth of humans whatever done...  Never he will be without pain or hurts, humans sensible will only live all that's truth... But there surely will be a better life for him. Its great."
I would NEVER send my children to a Christian summer camp.  If my child was SA I wouldn't call the camp I would go straight to the police.  I have seen that a lot with children molested by a church member or staff the parents make a complaint to the church before going to the police.  It boggles my mind.
"First off, the creep should have been fired or at minimum suspended/removed from the camp upon the first report of abuse. That fault rests on the camp and the admin for sure. That being said, what parent allows their 12yr old child to live with some strange adult man in their absence? That's complete negligence on their part. This reminds me of the boys that were allowed to live and literally sleep with Michael Jackson. Jackson basically bought off the parents giving them gifts, money, etc. while they allowed their sons to have ""sleep overs"" with him. The parents of the abused boy at camp then basically allowed themselves to be paid off by the camp by taking a settlement and signing non-disclosure agreements. Guess what -- that's called pimping out your child. Parents are just as bad as the pedo scum in jail."
Execute him not life in prison back to back
Nothing is more hateful than Christian love
"I wonder if this happened to someone I grew up with.  After she got deeply involved with the Christian youth camp, she was always telling me about experimenting with the boys there, and always had boys coming over with her, at 12-13.  I wonder if an adult introduced her to sexual activity, there.  It was a big behavioral change for her.  It seemed as if her childhood was over, suddenly."
That's means the whole camp is in on it and they don't want to stop. This is why i don't do church. Sick fucks.
"Gods will, right??"
"They keep calling him ""immature"" like hes not a grown ass man who was aware of the decisions he was making. Sick."
He is literally the devil praying on weak people glad hes locked up
"This was not inappropriate, wrong decision making - IT WAS CRIMINAL! That camp should have been closed down!!!"
All Religion is just a front to sexual abuse children.....These kids end up finger blasted
Doesn't surprise me at all
The camp was in on it as well.
Infuriating
christians dont wear budda buns you may ass well emulate satan.
Parents if it'd to good to be true it probably is
Always religious camps.
"I could never understand why people trust their children to others,  especially religious cults.   I consider all organized religion cults.   Spirituality should always be the only way to believe in something greater than yourself."
"I can't believe what I just watched. There shouldn't be any action plans, and it's not just a couple drops of water in a ""cascade"" of outstanding behavior. He's a damn pedophile. No adult should have to be taught to make better decisions because naked basketball and 4-wheeling with children shouldn't even be a consideration. There's no decision to make because normal adults wouldn't even think about these things."
All these elders especially the pastor of this organization will answer to the heavenly Father God and they will receive Justice. If they didn't receive Justice here on Earth they will receive it on judgment day which is going to be a lot worse because eternity burning in flames surrounded by demons in hell that's hardcore and it's what these adults that ran this organization deserve. Especially the pastor Joe White
Sounds like Falls Creek being ran by SENATOR JAMES LANKFORD at the time the worst abuse happened.
This breaks my heart! My most treasured memories growing up were Church Camp in Wisconsin.
"I was in the Roloff Homes, religion is poison, mankind is evil."
"For my family it was the salvation army. We suede, we won, 13 counts, but it cost me everything."
No pity for self righteous religious zealots.... at least going to the camp says something about their bank acct... Whish is all ameticans really care about.
Why why why is this organization not under federal investigation?
I've been to Branson. I loved it
"So many evil things are masked by Christianity, it's sick and disgusting."
"Oh my God, these organizations are *so* sick, incredible."
This is exactly why I dont trust any church/ programs that takes kids away from their homes.
"This happens all over the world. Time for people to start paying attention to what's happening to our children instead of doping them up on brain damaging, toxic, suicide inducing prescriptions!"
Watching things like this let me know I'm in the right place as far as my atheism goes.  Religious Indoctrination is strong.
It sounds like one big cabal of pedophiles.
"These christian organizations. All they do is pray over the sex offender, forgive him in the name of Jesus, then they forget it happened."
I totally understand why people take settlements but it does make it so that pretty much anyone with money can get away with whatever they'd like because they can pay for a settlement and I think thats a huge problem.
Glad I went to a Christian camp that has never done anything to kids! (Camp Berea in NH)
Christian camp is abuse. Period. Bring a child to a regular camp without brainwashing
Sounds like the same concept as British boarding schools. They're in the business of compromising the souls of children and breaking their minds. What did Jesus say about what would happen if anyone who interfered with children.and their relationships with God?
The fact that this camp is still in action is deeply disturbing.
Christian catholic and other religions  are not looks so good all the pedophiles politics and money! Kind of sounds like our republican party
"Aparrently this abuse issue is still being an issue , in a article I read, in 2016 3-6 girls were abused but only 2 were able to step up and call out the camper who was abusing them"
"They sent the family an Ipad??!! That alone screams ""We know we have done wrong, and we are gonna try to buy your silence"". DISGUSTING."
i went to k klassic for two summers. I was never abused but i was always freaked out by the swimsuit rules
Boycott the camp
Who funds that camp
Sue the living crap out of them (this is happening)
you know it not just kanaka that's doing these things
She should have filed a police report not called the camp.
Molestation is God's divine punishment for a sinful society. Pray for more molestation once it reaches the tipping point society will discard sin and it will no longer be necessary.  God's will comes through all things.
"Your first call upon hearing a complaint is *not* to call the place where abuse has occurred. Instead you call the authorities, a counselor, then media to keep the police hounded for answers. You do not call the place where the abuse occurred, you have your lawyer contact them! PERIOD"
8:35 look at that smirk
"How about *NOT* sending your kids away to a f*ckin cult and their depraved, sick, psychopathic staff in the first place??? How about not indoctrinating and brainwashing your children into this sick religion or any other religion. How about letting them choose for themselves, you know, when they are old enough to make that choice. I.e. when they are 18 or more.."
"Yet more evidence as to the virulence of religion. It needs to go. We have evolved past the point of needing dogmatic, old world myths to satisfy our curiousity."
"I have attended a couple of summer Christian camps myself as a teen, and can confirm that this inappropriate behavior is not limited to staff. I have met participants that exhibited inappropriate behavior as well. I was sexually approached by a participant when I attended, but I never told the youth pastors. Lots of wolves in sheep's clothing at these camps!"
Just read one of the victims committed suicide in 2019. Such a travesty others weren't held accountable
"8:52 that guy sounds emotionally immature. You're going to treat the sexual predator like he is a naughty child even though he is a grown man, really?"
I also have a few slumlords you should checkout
"Dear vice.  You need to checkout Beulah beach in vermilion Ohio 

Abuse has gone on there for decades.  

I know. I grew up there

You may even uncover a much larger nation or world wide issue in the organization of Christian missionary alliance
    There emblem looks a lot like the Methodist cross and flame"
"I think all kid touchers should meet with justice, carried out by the families who are affected. There is no cure for it."
"To everyone watching and those who will bother to read this, this video was released 9 months ago and has hundreds of thousands of views. Yet at this time the petition mentioned in the video, which has a small goal of 5,000 signatures, has only half that. 

If you went down to write a comment on how terrible this is, and just moved on with your day without doing the smallest and easiest task to actually change anything, shame on you fucking hypocrites."
Theres a special place in Hell for predators like these
"I'll take those child molesters out Happily I can't believe this... and all u parents did what?? Some freak touches your kids and possibly ruined your child's life. No no that bs ain't right & it's not gojng to work, what so ever.  I'd take a life sentence over 
knowing that I did nothing To help The future and present and past children."
"The most horrible thing are happening in ""the name of God"""
so dose it mean that they represent all Christians ? or just bad people ?
excellentreporting
This mess always happens at summer camps.....when are parents going to wisen up and not send their kids into that environment?!?!?! Maybe I am overprotective and overparanoid as I myself was raped as a child..........
I wish I could go
KKK KAMP.
All White Christian Kkkamp
Typical christian ways
"So....who is ready to bring back capital punishment for first time murders and first time rapists (deliberate, calculated, unapologetic)?"
Hot tub bible studies...
Maybe it's time these families reconsider being evangelical. Clearly the church does not have their interests at heart.
"Bottom Line, listen to your kids!!!!!!!!"
I remember Pete he ran the football elective we all thought he was a cool guy all of us wanted to be his friend we would all flock around him just to get a chance to talk with him makes me sick to think he was taking advantage of boys who thought the world of him I even had a photo of us in my room before all this came out
Let's hope people speaking out on the internet (and anywhere else) gets this place shut down!
"GOD'S HEALING POWER OF LOVE -VIDEObn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ThSBtzOdg"
I think this camp should be shut down.
kanakuk left me with so much trauma
"I camp in a park across the lake from a Kanukuk location. Sounds like Lord of the Flies at night. We get a kick out of hearing them yell, scream and have fun."
"I've often wondered if all religions were created, so sick individuals could have sex with children. It appears all religions have a history of historic and current child abuse.Why did the Catholic Church allow it to continue when even the popes knew it was rife within its cult. Islam, Judaism, all franchises of Christianity have dreadful records re child molestation. I was born and raised an Anglican but it it didn't take me long to realise that all religions were created by man to serve man. Sad thing is its been going on for 1000s of years and will continue because it goes right to the top. I have no answers."
I would like to see this camp shut down permanently.
A CHRISTIAN CAMP?... ARE YOU FREAKN KIDDING?... SO WHATS THE DIFFERENCE THEN?... DONT SEND THEM PLACES AND YOU (PARENTS) TAKE CARE OF THEM FOR AS LONG AS YOU CAN UNTIL THEY ARE INDEPENDENT>>> DONT TRUST THESE SO-CALLED CHRISTIANS TAKING CARE OF YOUR KIDS... ITS DISGUSTING...
"If you want to protect your children from child predators, keep em away from church and any church related activities. Kudos to the young man for speaking up; I'm sure it was extremely difficult and painful to discuss the horrible trauma he went through."
"Oh my God that White guy looks possessed by a demon, his eyes are black, his face looks like a skin suit mask!! This is literally demonic and I'm a pretty strong empath and he is involved and guilty too, it just pours off of him"
"Honest fu*k the parents too, contacting the CAMP AND NOT THE POLICE, THEY ARE ALL ACCOMPLICES TO THESE CRIMES"
Religious parents are negligent if they are using their religious organization as substitutes for parenting instead of parenting their children themselves.
Evangelicals=Loons
"It is insane how abusive Christian groups, churches, camps, schools, etc become so radically and openly supportive of their pedophile/s. It's like they've become infected with a parasite and refuse to get rid of it. Why they are so tangled up and obsessed with the few people they refuse to fire rather than the children they're supposed to protect. The Bible says nothing about shielding pedophiles. It says if you hurt a child, tying a two ton stone to your neck and jumping into the ocean is a better end than facing the wrath from God."
They   should   S H U T     IT    P E R M I N A T E L Y......
All the people trying to defend Christianity by saying it's everywhere. But if the roles were reversed like an immigrant doing this those same Christians would be horrified
"It's the government (whether it is federal or state, I'm not sure) that has to protect these kids and their families. But instead, a family that have nerves of steel and some money to fight off the lawful but unfair lawsuits has to do this job. Unbelievable."
"You would think pedophiles would stay away from situations that would expose their sickness. But no, they apply to be teachers, counselors and foster parents. Like wtf? Absolutely no control. Smh"
"Being ""abused"" is why I don't go to church. I'm not gonna post it up for the world to see, but trust me, bad things happened."
Jack white at 9:10 looking demonic af
I LOVE GOING TO KANAKUK BUT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE HEARD OF THIS (i just started going this year)
Have you all forgotten that there was incest in the bible?  You master didn't seem to have a problem with it..  Did I read a different bible?  I don't think I did.  Same with abortion and suicide lots of that going on in your book.
"Joe white is wall eyed
Mom drank"
Cooper looks like j. Epstein
"...... This is bullshit bc 
1. This isn't the only ""Christian summer camp"" that abused children
2. That this ""Christian camp's"" really care about the children that come to their camp BUT make their parents sign a NDA or they don't they're tried to tell the judge the family is breaking the ""NDA"" that doesn't assist etc. 
Like I said before this isn't the first and mostly not that last that we heard about Christian summer camps or ANY religious camps here in the US or anywhere in the world that parents send their kids to for the summer or etc."
"Protect the lives of the unborn child, but turn the cheek on the children here who need and plead for your help. Christianity is something"
I thought the shadow was post Malone
*They actually defend that PIECE OF SHZZT...WOW!*
"The FACT that even to this Day the Religion of Christianity is still around or Trusted today...I cannot for the Life of me understand, why? 

..."
OHHHHHH I AM SHAKING WITH ANGER
Id like to think these guys are going straight to the boiler room of Hell when theyre through.
"*Bro wtf, stop blaming the daughter for reporting someone sexualy abusing a kid, this is the evil they tell you abt in chruch these guys are it.*"
Parents need some accountability even before some of this stuff happens freely handing kids over to strangers
Any parent who sends their children to any religious camp has failed as a parent. Period.
Another nail in the coffin of religion.
A lot Christian believing people tend to believe that abuse is discipline.
hot tub bible studies lolololol this is too funny
"Hi, I 100 % agree with what everyone says about this camp. It needs to be shut down, and every one needs to get fired, and have some serious jail time, perhaps, life in prizon, without the possibility of puroll."
"to anybody who read my last comment, sorry for the long winded rant. But, I whent through a couple of past expirences in my life, and I had to get it out. My heart goes out to Ashton and his entire family. To Ashton, Keep fighting and speaking out against this buddy, you're not alone. They can't sue you or do anything to you and your family. May the Lord protect and watch out for you, and keep you guys safe throughout these rough waters. I know what its like to go to a Christian camp, and then have it not be at all what they say it is. I've never gone through anything like you have, however, they called it a Christian blind camp. However, you know what? I myself as a physical blind person and learning disability proclame, based on my past expirence at that camp say that it was anything but. First off, if they call it a blind camp, there should've been Braille signs through out every cabbon, and rest room. Guess what? There was no Braille. Plus, when I tried to ask for help getting back to the cabbon, one of the nurses refused to physically guide me back. And all she said to me was, ""Feel the rope Dave? I would say to her, ""Yes."" Then she replied back to me, ""There's the rope there Dave, Follow the rope"". It was not a good camp expirence when I whent there back in 2009, or for one of my other blind friends either. We never whent back. If you ever need to talk, you can email me. djenne0923@hotmail.com. Stay strong my friend."
"My heart goes out to all these people and their families going through this. I Hope and pray that this Christion camp gets shut down for good. This is 100 % wrong, and as a christion myself, this infuriates me down to the deepest parts of my being. and I command, in the name of Jesus that this needs to stop write about now, or I myself, Dave Jenne the blind guy will shut down this camp for you guys. Kind of reminds me of a Christion camp that I whent to back in 2009called Camp Laurolwelled in Rangely Maine. I'll spair all the detales, but, let's just say, it was seposed to be a blind Christion camp, however, it was anything but. Plus, it was not blind user friendly for me or for any other blind person, because nothing was in Braille. PS, anybody who says otherwise is in deep dark denyle, and all they're doing is fooling theirselves. I however, am not in denile, I tell it like I expirence it. If something is blind user friendly, and I've had a good expirence, I'll tell you. If it wasn't, I'll let anybody know. then I'll make sure that I brodcast it near far and wide from the rooftops as if I'm a blind radio diskjoki, manually opperating the radio stations all over the face of the Earth until people take me serious, and believe me.  Anyway, If you call yourself a Christion camp, and you're doing this to young men, Shame on you you deep dark fools, This deep dark secretive behavior will not be talorated bye Dave Jenne the blind guy. And if I, Dave Jenne hear anymore of this from a Christion camp, I as a blind person will hire a deep dark lawyer,and a deep dark court judge, and we will shut down your camp, under no uncertain turms, no questions asked. Are we clear Camp Kentutook? Good."
Somehow the worst atrocities to children end up in the hands of religious perverts. The Catholic Church is a good example.
"At any time, if and when such organizations big or small take advantage of ANYONE in such a manner and that victims themselves and parents if remain silent are just as criminal as those that commit such a crime."
A lot of churches dont do back ground checks when they hire people or let them volunteer babysit children & its wrong to not do background checks they assume if they are christian that they would not do anything bad but it is a false belief and these sex offenders know these christian churches & camps are overly trusting & that's why they target those types of jobs
It's crazy how close this is to me and I wouldn't have ever known
This is not what God stands for
I  can't believe this the little girl tells her mom that she saw someone being abused and instead of doing investigating the abuser they try to turn it around or her family in her how sick
"Everyday, christianity strays further away from god. How currupt. I hope god strikes them down."
Christianity is a sick cult. So toxic. When will people realise.
"Awww boohoohoo... tell this story to the millions of Indigenous kids that were stolen by the church priests and taken to boarding schools/churches and either never came back home, sent them to other european colonizer homes, traumatized or killed under their watch.... european americans have been doing this since their conception of world domination"
NDAs should be made illegal and deemed unenforceable for anything related to child abuse. Same with capture and kill with media companies.
"There is a type of deviant who will never actually
touch children.  They get their kicks from HEARING detailed accounts of a molestation, or just reading a transcript of the evidence.nowadays,  That type of pervert can fill all sorts of jobs"
The mom should have called the FBI on the camp
"As a child, I wanted to go to summer camp. 
But then I saw that movie."
Sounds like the Christian thing to do!!
I was 12 years old. I mean what was I supposed to do really at 12 years old? There's no damn way I would have let somebody do that to me Even younger I wouldn't have let someone do that
Half a million campers and 100 years. That's not very much
"8:59 are you fucking serious? Outstanding character, example, and role model?! You're kidding me!!!"
"8:58 The preacher looks scary asf, look at his eyes. Idk but he creeps me out"
"I see way too many pedophiles in these Religious camps and Churches, wayyy too many!!! I'm glad to be an atheist and not have to be around these sick predators!! I've seen far too many pedophile pastors too, it's sickening. They hide behind a bible to gain trust."
damn cuh this dude creepy
"Yep, that's the ugly truth and it doesn't just happen in Christian summer camps.  I witnessed it at Boy Scout Summer camp.  I told my folks about it.  I never went back.  They supported me fully in that decision.  Kids need to know early on about the dangers they can face in such seemingly harmless groups."
"Sexual abuse of children is not ""inappropriate behaviour"", it is pure evil. The CEO should be locked up. Anyone who sends their kids here should have their kids removed from them by Social Services."
"I know how easy it is and how quick it is to be abused sexually. I myself have gone through it when I was a kid. My son is 11 and we are wanting to send him to summer camp since he is an only child. We were late to the game of enrolling in summer camp because we've never sent our kid to summer camp before. The only summer camps that still have availability are Christian camps. Now, just because this camp is Christian doesn't mean that there are bad people there. It could be called anything it doesn't matter you're putting your child into the hands of strangers! Just so happens that when you send children to be alone with a religious background bad things happen. It sucks it's awful! Thank God this video showed up because I didn't want to send my son to summer camp especially a Christian summer camp! My husband almost had me talked into it. Nope it ain't happening!"
"The camp is still operating, right?
What kind of parent would send their child there?"
Gross and typical
"The young man is so strong telling his story. Brought me to tears,"
Devils servant
Just dont sent your kids there any more
The person who refused is being harassed
Also they are having y sign no statement can be made reference to the case what does that tell you
I would never send a child to that camp poor judgement in people running the camp.
"First Red Flag, ( Christian Camp).."
nah brah.....they all should be held accountable and sent to prison at this point....
"that guy at 8:08 is just a terrible human being....he literally smirked before he gave that excuse as to y they didnt fire that other dude......only he meant to say ""we didnt fire him because it might make the camp lose money...."""
this would be something that would really make me consider murdering someone over my child.....
"These are the same people that call anybody that does not prescribe to their beliefs ped0philes, its so hypocritikal."
Imagine your son getting molested and the camp just sends you a fruit basket. Lmao I would of had the hole camp shut down Till an investigation was done
those 2 camp guys leaders look weirdooooos OMG
"This is why I hate this fucked up religion, they do these things to poor innocent children that did absolutely nothing, and somehow it these people that do these things get by saying ""the Lord said blah blah blah, and it was the right thing to do"""
Mr Newman is a trump supporter
"I remember way back in pre-k this was like 40 years ago, before it was even called pre-K in this area. I went to a place called Peachtree Presbyterian. It was a really young teacher there named Kevin. Even as a four year old kid I gotten real creepy vibes from this guy. I told my parents that there's something not right about him. Luckily my parents pulled me out in time for kindergarten. But when I would mention to the other kids that the guy was weird to me, they would all bash me and said, ""oh no how could you say that Mr. Kevin is nice."" 
30+ years later it finally came out that he had been molesting little boys at that place for years. If your kids ever have a bad feeling, that intuition is real... trust them!"
"What does this say about religion, time and time again these disgusting perverts take advantage of children, all while holding the Bible. It's amazing religion in general is still taken seriously."
"Hearing Joe White talk about how great Pete was, except for the ""immaturity"", makes me wish all his young male relatives and their friends were campers at this time."
I can guarantee that the director was working for much less than a common director would be paid. So guys like Joe White couldn't stand to lose him when he would work for such a discount. He probably never took days off.
"It literally boggles the mind that people are allowed to do this freely without consequence, however, I think that the person doing the abusing, has dirt on everyone else, and I can guarantee, that if he went to jail, he would be compensated on the back end by the church, to an account he could access later, so he would keep quiet and serve his sentence."
You want to know where the sinners congregate? Go visit a church.
Honestly just avoid camps.
Nobody should be trusted with children these days. Unfortunately this world is full of horrible people who target kids. If your a parent keep them close and protect them.
"Thats as far away as you can get from being a real CHRISTIAN. Is it soo hard to see through this as a Parents?? I think not! SPEND YOUR FREE TIME WITH YOUR CHILDREN, DONT SEND THEM TO "" SUMMER CAMPS ""."
11:00 ... Does vice actually expect this to be anonymizing? you didnt change his voice at all and his silhouette wasn't exactly ... perfect to say the least. WTF IS wrong with Vice.
9:18 this man is fucking despicable.
"Evangelicals are some of the most twisted sects of the christian religion. Charlatans, false prophets, abusers, right up there with the Catholics. It's all about money and power. You cannot trust anyone in a church that is both wealthy because of money earned through the church and part of its leadership."
Twitter going crazy
"I have a ten year old son. He doesn't go to camp for exactly this reason. You CANNOT TRUST people with your children  when will we realise this? He doesn't lots of awesome things, but no way, no how is he sleeping multiple nights away from home.  no. No way. And we talk to him about this stuff."
"the sad thing about this is that every christian will now, probobly be seen as a bad person. this camp and all the staff involved in these terrible decisions should be prosecuted, and all of the camps assets and property seized. We had something like this happen at my church, and no surprise, nothing was done about it."
"This Kanakuk camp is a family camp, so this is all technically a lie. The camp they are showing is a completely safe family camp, and ive learned from my entire 25 years at the camp they are showing"
All those men at the camp are gunna get raped everyday in hell
This is only talking about the gay male adult supervisors getting caught there. Let that sink in.
@9:05 are his eyes fully black??? Demons breh
Wtf I went there over 2 decades ago
I definitely would never wanna go to a Christian camp especially since I have a huge dislike towards Christianity and I would never send my kids to any Christian camp or any Christian group ever!!!
Victims silenced.  As usual.
The government needs to regulate these camps and do random checkups. How many more boys are going to be abused in camps like these and the Boy Scouts etc.
Camp Chomo is not the place to go. SMH
Stop thinking because its called Christian means its safe!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
NDA's do not cover crimes.
I only sent my kids to there frejnds hkuse the summer
"NDAs do not cover illegal behaviour in Canada, not sure about individual states in USA."
"They didn't miss the warning signs, they ignored the warning signs."
"Pedos cover for other pedos, so I'm not surprised nothing was done. Time to look at those running this place."
Stop it with the VOCAL FRY! It makes your content borderline unwatchable.... #americanwomen sigh.
"Speaking out helps so many, you don't even know. The abuse happens TO you, not with you. It's not YOUR shame you carry. It was their responsibility to keep you safe. Now they have to take their lumps, and hopefully enough parents will hear and act. This is like the new report about the Baptist sexual abuse cover ups... Hopefully these types of co-conspirators hurting victims will not be tolerated much longer."
I mean it a Christian summer camp. What do people expect. Sexual misconduct of a minor is the norm of this disgusting religion.
How come all Christian organizations are either killing people for none believing or abusing kids cause they just can? Crazy some of the worlds worste genocides with exception of nazis were all Christian and god related... insane
just wanna say that this one parent sounds like a toootal Karen lol
Yay for religeon preying on the naivety of children in general.
"The dysfunctional psycho, social, sexual Christian Fundie nonsense is astounding."
"Nobody thinks that a hot tub at a Christian camp is a bit unusual? What really gets me going, these Evangelicals spew their follow Jesus, and they think God doesn't mind this? I wanted to reach through this screen and spit in the faces of these idiots saying it was immature judgement, and all the wonderful appreciation for this pervert"
"Christian Camps, just like the Catholic church and Boy Scouts etc, are all target rich environments for peds. Why kids are still exposed to these situations by parents/guardians is beyond me. Nonetheless, the dastardly people responsible for these atrocities should be thrown in jail with their cell doors left open and then watch just how fast true justice is served"
Molest my child you would never make to court
The judge ought to be removed.  Where is law enforcement?  TAKE THEM DOWN
"How could they? How confused must this leave the abused children? This is so evil. And they did in in Jesus' Name. But they will face judgment: ..'as you did to the least of these, you did to Me' says Jesus"
"Simple answer people, find your God at home,  whatever that may be.  The organized religions are full of nothing but criminals and frauds seeking your money."
"Anytime we sign anything...WE should write below our signature...ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. WITHOUT PREJUDICE
UCC 1-207 and/or UCC 1-308...but also MUST overSTAND what your doing and what your saying when you reserving your rights..."
I worked at a YMCA run summer camp when I was 17/18 and we had such strict rules in order to prevent stuff like this and to recognize signs of sexual abuse.  We were not allowed to be alone with a camper ever.  One time one of my campers ran off from the group during a large meeting and I went after her and had to spend a decent amount of time trying to convince her to come back to the group.  Afterwards I got in major trouble and was yelled at because I was alone with her.  It's crazy that what happened at that camp was allowed for so long.
Definetly. Get rid of all the abusers. Y not. A bunch of pedophiles.
"Parents,  why don't you take your children on vacation yourself?  Don't talk to strangers,  don't go to strangers,  than you send them off to strangers yourself.. samexwith childcare.  Mothers,  stay homecand raise your child yourself.  Watch Jason Cooley,  Pastor of the OPBC. OLD PATH BAPTIST CHURCH.  His church is in  Minnesota."
Hope Joe White gets the jail. Then God will send him to hell.
Joe White is a pervert. He likes to abuse children.
It looks like this camp is still in business.  What a shame.  Disgusting what has been allowed to continue.
"Parents probably sent their kids to some like Christian Conversion Therapy camps after this, too"
"My favorite part about growing up evangelical catholic was isolating and identifying with absolute certainty in my that how people can be emotionally and mentally controlled. This is something that the churches have known for decades in fact. But they abuse it and overly rely on that fact, they think they can control everyone, in doing so they control nobody.

This is something I am usually reluctant to tell people."
Children of sexual abuse should be allowed to speak up without repercussions!
The CEO looks like a whitewalker
Let's not mention the history of the Catholic church and their connection to child sacrificing dating back to the Canaanites. But instead we'll talk about the fraction of Christians that have fallen to the devil's grasp.
Your confusing civil non discloser acts with.....ugh I'm confused.  Don't send your kids to this camp then.  I mean yuk!!  Is it still in business?
these people are disgusting
Praise the Lord...lol
"Don't send your kids with strangers.. if you want them to camp, camp with them."
"How many more Christians are subjecting their innocent kids to these deranged so called spiritual leaders. The sexual abuse by so many church leaders of innocents is a bright red flag for every parent, but indoctrination robbing their kids of personal agency and independent thinking for life is something I'll never understand.
Grow up and take responsibility for your own life. There is no big daddy in the sky. You're ruining your kids because your mind was bent. Any indoctrination of children is pure evil."
But why you sign the NDA knowing that more kids could become victims?
EVANGALICAL PARENTS??  look no further for blame..but of course they deflect!
"Every single leader was complicit in the abuse and should be held criminally liable. My heart is so grieved for the victims and thier experience of people who grossly misuse the tremendous power and responsibility entrusted to them. What's worse, to abuse at all, and the most vulnerable at that, in the name of God, is just utterly sickening."
"I think ppl like getting abused and love evil bc they keep bringing children into this cruel world in spite of the misery they go through and the horrors they see, hear and experience esp religious ppl. I over heard a woman's daughter say to her mom. ""Why did you bring me here to work"". Then stated, ""I'm not having kids"" As the old saying goes.  ""there is a fool born every minute"".  Lol 
That woman's daughter has learned early on in life that many wouldn't learn in a life time that this life isn't worth living and is nobody's fool. Smart girl."
"Pedophiles are not Democrats.  They are the Christian right wingers.  Pedophiles need to be with kids.  Any time you have kids you have a pedophile nearby.  Teachers, counselors, preachers, choir directors, Sunday school teachers, coaches, boy-girl scouts, you name it....if there are children there are peds.  The Church is a cover for this evil.  Do not be stupid because none of this is from God.  This is ALL man.  To get near kids."
"Wow.. for them to be okay with him doing it makes you wonder if maybe the other staff was doing something similar.. or they really thought they could ""save"" him... or equally evil, they just don't want bad press about their camp!"
The camp should be shut down. The owner(s) and management should be either thrown in jail or fined heavily with the payout going to the victims. Any perpetrators not already serving time should be imprisoned.  Since when is the law determined by the church and not the state??!!  To experience such abuse at the hands of someone the child thought to be trustworthy is abhorrent! And then on top of it all to be bullying the victims and their parents not to speak of it is outlandish!!  These people need to stop hiding behind the Bible and live with their true colors in plain site of the world.  Hypocrites all of them.
Me too. And then as an adult at recruitment drive.
NEVER leave your child in the hands of complete strangers!
"What about ""troubled teen"" camps, still active and abusing kids? I went to one for 2 years that is shut down now because of abuse. Why are these types of facilities allowed to continue to exist?"
Demons hiding in sheeps clothing...shut that bullshit camp down...who in thier right mind would even send thier kid there?
"That place is clearly crawling with monsters, from the CEO all the way down. The fact that they covered for him & even lied knowing they were putting kids at risk shows that they are ok with the abuse & feel there isnt anything wrong with it."
Sounds more like an organised system of abusers. What normal person would help child abusers? Other abusers would
"Christians, huh?"
That kamp i will destroy it
Faith. A Christian fault.
One word... Prison.... for ALL
Finally Vice doing something good
Child sex abuse is a long standing tradition for Christians. Stop persecuting the Christians. Jesus loves all people even newman.stop disrespecting god.
"Those other two guys seem to give him permission and make excuses for his behavior as ""childish""? Molesting children is not not childish it's a crime. Pedophiles seem to stick up for each other, don't they?"
"I guess they missed that part, or they did know they but still continued to make him look bad instead of admitting their own mistakes"
"Only difference is Bill Clinton came forward she admitted he did that 

And how horrible he felt,"
That camp should be closed
nasty religious bullshit
"I , female teacher in primary school, have...decades ago....been taking a shower after my lessons for the children....I participatied all the exervcition...so I was sweaty aswell... The head of my school taught his children .12/13 year olds, just after  it was my time......he placed his stuff in the only shower-facility there was for the teachers....!! I diidn't feel comfortable to be naked there where he dropped his stuff...so I took my shower in the children facility...they were 8/9 year olds girls ...and boys separated.....it was never a problem and I told the parents I did this...The real reason I did not tell them I did this...was that I wanted to see if any child was abused or not......abuse takes often place below the couvert area of children. I behaved with reluctance in exposant myself... I Explained the children why I needed to shower with the children...they reacted a bit curieus for a few times...and when they saw I was just like their mother...it was over....!! I never had a problem with it....!! There were no sexual things going on...!!"
There needs to be laws that make NDA's in cases like this illegal
Christianity has ALWAYS fostered abuse. why are people so shocked?
Shut it down the government needs to step in money should never come before life but in today's age it won't ever happen corruption is coming to the USA in a bigger way
"Now, if only they did a segment like this on Disney and his ""magical kingdom"", that would be great!!!"
my granddaughter was wanting to go there. saved up enough to go. I said no!
Them people will never admit it
When they say 60 it is really like 200.
None of the staff that allowed the abuse to happen should be allowed to live
Was the camp Catholic?
"Everybody raised in fundamental churches knows about the sexual double standards.  These churches not only cover it up, they overlook adultery when it is very specifically pointed out in the 10 Commandments.  All you have to do is sleep with your neighbor and then ask for forgiveness again and again and again....."
Religion is so screwed up..
"For many years I've been advocating    for church services and Bible study to include examples of what moral behavior and misbehavior looks like using the Fruit of the Spirit verse in Galatians as a moral baseline. Add to that the set of 1980s children books by Joy Berry to teach examples of lying, cheating, greed, jealousy, bullying, stealing, worry, etc (30+ title topics). In this way children, adults, church, and society can benefit. When I talk to church leaders about this idea I generally get ""sounds ok but we're not doing it.""  They apparently don't want to focus on their sins and how to avoid them. Instead, they pray for God to forgive them and then the many repeat offenders consider themselves ok to continue their debauchery."
"So disgusting and to yet so pervasive. It doesn't matter what you think as a leader, you have mandatory reporting requirements you MUST obey. Now you look like a board of criminals because you are"
Religion is just about controlling the poor and week. They have used religion for millenia to say abusing girls is okay. Even our SCOTUS thinks so. So very sorry for all abused kids.
I went to many Christian camps as a child and adult. Never saw abuse. This is a rare thing unlike the LGBT community where is normal and forced in schools the left always lies about Christians and conservatives.
This is horrible .
"Just outrageous! Horrible, impossible and unfair,heartbreaking,heartacking!"
"WTF!!! The management is just as much of a monster as Pete Newman! Molestation and playing basketball NUDE with kids is not JUST ""Inappropriate behavior"" It's f***ing sick and a CRIME! They should be in jail along side that POS! I am outraged rn. 

Attorney: Why didnt you fire him?

Kris Kooper: ""Because we thought it was just immature decision making and that we needed to help him make better decisions.""

Joe White: ""It was like drops into the bucket of a cascade of appreciation, a cascade of outstanding character....""

Are you f***ing kidding me rn! No, you didn't need to help HIM! You needed to stand up for those kids he abused! And how TF can the character of any person who sexually abused kids ever be considered outstanding? Idgaf if he spent time with the freaking Dalai Lama! He's a pedophile! He has the worst character! Prosecute these managers as well! They allowed this to happen!"
"religious zealots/religious vigilante/highly religious/fundamentalists of any religion generally have antisocial / psychotic tendency common deviant behavior skew towards sexual abuse, it's A symbol of domination. so what's the different between christian fundamentalists and ISIS? none, both believers behave exactly in the same manners."
In what sane version of the world has this disgusting place not been shut down? Disgusting because leadership has hidden behind money & influence while knowing for decades this kind of criminal activity has been going on!
full run pedo camp
"""Immature decision making and poor judgment."" Are you f***ing kidding me?  These people choose to bury their heads in the sand.  Child molesters are basically welcomed into these willfully ignorant and irresponsible places."
Cana. is EVIL! They are not christians victims should lawyer up and go after them. Until they are left with nothing and shut down. Any so called christians that would allow molestation isn't Christian. This camp is run by the devil and I bet those owners do this as well. Bet your bottom dollar.
Hot tub bible study?! WTF!?
"Since Jesus love the little children and he really want all kids to be in heaven, Christianity became a religion where children are suppose to be ""safe"" in churches. But then the perverts come and say they're christians and work in christian camps and churches so they can do their ways with them"
"The ""Cloak of Christianity"" hides unspeakable evil all over the world.  I guess most of the sheep don't mind making sacrificial lambs of the victims."
That's why you never send your kids to camp or leave them with adults unsupervised
My brother sent my niece  to a camp I was very worried she was okay.
I am forever thankful my mum felt weird about sending me to any camps or scouts no matter how much I wanted it.
More proof that god does not exist!
This is what religion does!!
So why do parents still send they're children to this pedo camp!!god humans are so dumb
"Whenever something like this happens, it's obviously a heinous and atrocious act. 
But when the rest of the staff and people in the organization try to deny it, or play it off like it's no big deal, it just makes it so much worse. Just own up to it."
Why send your child to these camps ? They are full of beasts
i was raised in a christian family and my mother refused to let me go to those camps and i did not want anyway. thank you Jesus. thank you mammy
"Thank you for letting everyone know what happened to you. You are brave and deserve justice. Keep going,  the USAG gymnasts had their day to speak and all of you deserve the same."
"Perverts are protected by the church, child molesters and rapist are all looking for jobs with churches they keep them hidden pay bribes to silence and transfer them to do it again"
"I worked at a Christian camp for 8 years, I cannot believe what this guy got away with, naked atv riding? Naked basketball?! We had a counselor get fired for shaving a kids head(he wanted to, his mom wasn't happy when he got home).. Like howwww are these not massive red flags?!"
"This is why I  don't join religious organizations, I choose to have a solo journey with my spirituality and God; Too many organized religions focus on getting money from people  but yet they don't focus on handling evil issues in our world such as sexual misconduct; I've never heard a church talk about sexual misconduct but yet I constantly hear stories of sexual misconduct from church members"
Voice news is paid for by the illuminati satanists.  Don't believe anything they say.
Well that's on them they send there kids there .
keep your hands to yourself Father.
How NOT surprising.
Allegedly abused
Get over it
"I like how these Christian Church leaders term sexual based crimes against children as 'Immature Behavior'
Can I get a ""WTF"" ?!?!?!"
White looks demonic and this is so sad people knew about Pete and still kept him there
Ppl who hurt children deserve nothing. They aren't human.
"We have a growing part of ""Evangelical Christians"" that are promoting Q conspiracy theories that involve baby eating and child trafficking. Look closer to home because the crazy train is all above board. Send your children to these establishments and see what happens. When the wrong can fight and put down through legal means the wronged yet they start talking about pro life and baby eating Jewish Cabals. Get the frick outta here. Their is a mental discount to that kind of Idiocracy. What is the distance? Why be so discouraged and disconnected? I don't understand. I'm not an atheist or an anarchist. I'm not gonna allow that ignorance in my life."
"I love how they call pedophilia ""inappropriate"" and ""immature"" ,a lot of sick action gets so lovely adjectives."
"Don't go near the  people that call themselves ""christians"".  You be ruined for life"
This is contradicting when they say it this way stop and think about it they're covering up their contradicting misconduct of all directions and obstruction of justice by violating the rights of parents and the Miranda rights of children
They're lying about the warning signs they knew when they start talking like that they're hiding the truth they help the perpetrator and they hit the truth about knowing that the perpetrator had a sexual background and that he was in a predator just like the golden Knight motel in Gresham when Gresham PD new about the school teacher who was a sex of predator and destroyed tapes and this is an honest truth back they pretend they don't know what they did that makes them incessory of what the perpetrator did to the child you still need to talk to her to do a full investigation of the campus and find out why they lie to you and all others how many other children were sexually assaulted at the camp with rays of red flag when you bring it to the public side other kids will step forward when you do how can we trust anyone anymore with our children knowing that they knew but then to see if they hide the truth of hidden acts of crimes they knew they had criminal backgrounds these people should be penalized for lying and believe me they need to stop our children didn't ask to be a solid by a predators that they knew about our children and as families are being set up this is not acceptable behavior of blindsighting the parents and children and taking their innocence I have two daughters and two sons have been through this it is not acceptable liars I will never take the word of anyone who says anything at all because they hide the truth of hidden crimes and not checking the backgrounds they lie about the investigations of doing criminal background checks properly look under Google and listen to the guy who released a lot of information from the government stating the truth about all this people need to know the truth and they need to hear it for their self they're threatening to put him in prison for a long time please look under YouTube and listen he's in trouble for government documents that he released to the public letting everyone know the truth and his mom and dad misses him so much I have to praise him he's our hero for releasing the truth to the Publix e y e so that you would know the truth nothing but the truth so help me God I have been telling people for quite a while that the government is crooked they betrayed the rights of humans misconduct and obstruction of justice they broke the law
And they wonder why people are leaving the church in droves!
Their perpetrators of covering up for the perpetrator that means they're just like him they need to be investigative fully before they can work for any of the camps any further always make sure that they check the background of these individuals if they don't one person who stated online said they never do investigations except for the ones they dislike they'll investigate this gentleman spoke out through the government he said if we don't stand up for rights they will keep walking on us like Hitler's it is not acceptable behavior of government not protecting the well-being of the safety of all human beings land security is a joke he says they don't do nothing to help anyone they're in on what's happening to our families and they're taking from our families look under YouTube and listen to the gentleman that's on there he gave out government documents that states a lot of this you only need to hear it for yourself
Curt Newman is no better he sexually assaulted when he was in the state of Oregon and that ain't no joke I was an underage minor he drove a green z Corvette he takes advantage of the underage minors as well as his family siblings this ain't no joke they seem to get away with it in the state of Oregon no worse than out of state some giving you a heads up Kurt Newman is related to him God bless you for stepping forward don't need this to happen to any more children it is not acceptable behavior that's going on for decades Kurt Newman had raped a 6 year old girl in the past this came from deli and Dewey sports whose son owns the D's in and out in Gresham Oregon these parts is their son he don't talk about it but his mom and dad know that Kurt Newman raped a 6 year old girl and got away with it it's about time people start standing up and speaking out they also have a tendency of threatening people's families not acceptable behavior of violence Kurt should have been thrown in jail a long time ago instead he's gotten away with it and a lot of others that lived in Orient drive off the countryside off the Old highway 26
Disgusting!!!
SICK
I have been getting bullied by Christian extremists for liking ass play. Fact is... Maybe I would be less gay if I wasn't was abused by my pastor for 3 years ages 5-8.
"they spell camp with a k and have a lot of k's in their name? Well the KKK is a Christian organization, so I would not be surprised if they are related to each other."
9:00 jesus fucking christ if there was ever lizards inside human skin suits that is exactly what they would look like.
There is no real justice in this world!  Justice will come from the true judge... GOD!
They got money to lose. That's why they want to cover it up what do they use all that money for ? Seems they all got there hands in the money pocket  the whole thing needs to be shut down
"I knew a girl was SA at a Christian school in Burbank, CA. Her and her sister were. They testified in court, idk what happened to him. But he ended up living with family in Glendale, Ca across the street from Brand park. It was a house with all these plants in front so no one could see the house #, there was this one guy who would stare ppl down if they looked too long at the house."
"CEO guy gave me the creeps, stupid explanation for keeping the pedophile. He should have paid in jail as well."
"that ""church camp"" is not of God considering they failed to protect His children"
These groups aren't holy! They pretend to be holy to grift and abuse the very people they claim to be saving! They are following false prophets that have changed the words of God and Jesus for a millennia for their own greed to push the week down and be controlled! Heresy and hypocrisy to the max!
"Bad, discusting things, happen to young people everywhere, and in every sect or group, and that should be severely dealt with. Camps, daycare centers, schools, with or without denomination. Abuse is most everywhere. Drug dealers get away with murder. So why, are only Christians, relentlessly being targeted?!  It's another new trend, to show hate. There's good and bad in all places. There's extremely, wealthy, non- christian, religious leaders too. They threaten and dominate their people, and take Big money, from them. I'm a Catholic and proud if it! I never felt scared about my church or faith. If others did, sorry for them, but now we are told not to judge certain people, but only Catholics can be? Only the big hypocrites, hide the actual realities, so stop throwing stones!"
God is against all child abusers including wolves in sheeps clothing
"If I were to click on a mistitled video and it happened to be Joe White getting hit in the face with a baseball bat repeatedly, i would rewatch it repeatedly and enjoy it"
"Home school people and do not put your kids in day cares, public & private schools nor christian camps or sunday schools. You are setting them up to be preyed upon by predators."
Sooo fucked up smh
Joe white has a face you can trust
If his bosses let him get away with this S.A. it makes you wonder what type of people themselves are maybe they also engage in this type of behavior.I am glad this pervert was finally put in jail.I hope all the victims have been able to heal.
"Abuse sexual, emotional, psychological and physical abuses within the Christian cult? That's not surprising at all. It's perfectly allowed and encouraged in the bible; and if you think it doesn't then you haven't read the cult manual."
How come this circus is still open? Simply mind blowing!
Religion is cancer
"It stems and starts , Before The infamous, Pope John Paul ||.

Religious And governments are Facilitated By no other than Spineless cowardice , Individuals who are capable of Preying Upon the Innocence of these Families And their Children.

Shame On them All."
At least at Satan Camp I know what my kids are in for;
"3:08 this is so disgusting... it says in the bible that one day, someone will try to replicate/copy Jesus, I think I found him..."
Southern Baptist Church has been abusing its members for years.
"GO figure, kids at a christian summer camp being abused and it being covered up."
Wow. It's almost like their God doesn't care or doesn't exist.
I have never trusted  the church or  priest
Evangelical. Key word. One of the worst groups in christianity.
"Abused at a ""christian"" summer camp..."
Joe white is creepy looking. Did his eyes get poked out?
That's some cult sh*t right there.
"I always wonder why these greedy and twisted organizations keep abusers around. After the first reports, don't you just quietly fire the guy, saving yourself trouble? What kind of people keep predators around kids and why would they do that? At the very least, wouldn't their own greed and desire for self-preservation motivate them to get rid of the predators?"
"I wish someone could please explain to me why people never call the police or CPS. This happened with the Catholic church too when priests abused kids. The families went to the church. If my child was harmed sexually, I would take them to the ER and make a report with the police and CPS and any government oversight agency responsible for regulating such institutions. Why do people always call the place that hurt their kid instead of the people whose job it is to investigate such things? This is a crime. You would not think twice to call the police if someone vandalized your car or broke into your home."
"""I called the camp"".... wtf would you call the camp??? parents are part of the problem. call the police and the dept of justice."
Conservative evangelical Christians at their finest.
"organized religion is root of so many evils in our society. child predation is particularly awful but, it's a pretty big umbrella of manipulation and control. Learn to think for yourself. stop making ""gods"" out of fallible, fellow human beings. This camp should be shut down. stop listening to people who tell you how to live your life on faith based bullsh**."
And these are the people that support the Republican party. It's freaking scary to think religion(s) gets away with this crap.
Why is religion full of perverts?
Everyone who could have fired Newman and didn't needs to be looked into for the same behaviors.
Fruit baskets?! Im just an uncle and I would do some ungodly things to the poor bast3rd.
"Christian is NOT synonymous with good, decent, moral, righteous."
Camp should be shut down
Why are abusing the kids ?
"Historically churches are where child molesters and predators go because not only do they know they will be forgiven, they will be protected.  If you're a charismatic and valuable church authority, people like Mr White will look past you molesting 60+ children.  If you send your children to any church camps regardless of it's reputation it is your fault as a parent who's job it is to protect your children because you know this information, and it is only a matter of time before it is infiltrated by a pedophile, are you willing to risk your child's entire life for a camp?  This level of trauma never goes away."
"As someone who attended Kanakuk for three years I can say that they have taken enormous steps to address these allegations including a mandatory safety video on boundaries and stricter vetting requirements for counselors.  I never felt unsafe and while the past is unfortunate, it does not do any good to continue to bash the camp after they have already owned up to their mistake."
"Just to be real GD clear....""inappropriate"" is when you piss with the bathroom door open in a house full of people. What these sexual pervs did was fking CRIMINAL. There is a LAW that says if you see or know of child abuse and do not report it, you can also be held accountable. Not only did they not report it to the authorities, they condoned it...for decades!!"
"Thank you, Vice, for bringing this to the attention of so many. This flawed logic that you can just fix people by giving them continued support and insight into how to avoid being caught in the future is ludicrous. Unfortunately, Evangelical Christianity is not alone in this train of thought. Enablers come from all walks of life and abusers thrive in their shadows."
Hot tub bible studies!! Jesus Christ!!!!
The safest place for a pedophile is a church.

Its so discusting... poor boys
"Parents sending their young kids to Christian camps or camps of any kind,is as stupid as it gets. These places are usually pedophiles' paradise. Smh."
"Wow,the father,Joe Alarcon,what an absolutely fantastic,sexy bear !"
This is sad that some people call themselves Christians and then they go a moleste kids which is sickening.
no hate like christian love
"Immature judgement? He's serial offender. Imagine getting the kids traumatized and ruined just because he didnt think it was criminal. Thats a devil in disguise,  all deserve  jail time."
Most churches are groups and occult
Merica!
Not them offering free camp as a way to codify their families of the molestation at that camp.
There is more sin in the church then there is on the streets
KanaKuK. See it?
"""Those who practice homosexuality do not inherit the Kingdom of God. THEY traded the Truth of God FOR A LIE AND TAUGHT IT TO OTHERS."""
Not firing him was poor judgement
You're not alone!
"Isn't it odd that the most pedophiles come from a religious background?
I'm at the point that I think most western religions are just cults to touch on kids. 
No disrespect to those who are actually within the realms of their idea of a single God. 
I was raised Lutheran and Non-denominational. 
Which is exactly why I do not believe in any literal term of God.
My lord and savior  or higher being, is the relationship between my myself and my brothers and sisters. 
We are all in this together."
"It's so fucking heart breaking to think about all this kids losing their childhood. Then they grow up and can have disfunction relationship, be further abused or becoming the abuser.. then losing their adulthood."
"ADDENDUM: Counselors and Leaders at Kanakuk are known to be legally blind and deaf, and incapable of looking up simple definitions of Child Abuse and Sexual Assault in the Dictionary."
Alot of pedos in religion. It's scary the amount to family that still take their kids to this camp. They're all ok with it
"You're crazy if you send your kids off with strangers to a remote place thinking everything is going to be ok.
Kid's camps are Sodomite bug lights."
Wow this is crazy. I've been to a few Christian camps over the course of years as I was going through school in multiple states. I never experienced anything like this thankfully though can't say the same outside of camp lmao
"Sickening!!!!
The catholic church
This religion.  
All are about money and claiming a no paying taxes, free money from people"
The church should pay a precautionary molestation tithe. 10% of all tithes going into a fund for kids about to get molested. SHUT ALL THESE BAD PLACES DOWN.
Any parent that sends there kids to any summer camps is just careless parents facts
Religion is a sickness that brings out the worst in people while justifying their vile actions towards innocent people.
"A Christian man made me fearful of older men. I didn't say anything because I wasn't a part of their church, so i didn't know what to do or who to go to. When I mentioned it to a mental health professional, she helped me contact the right authorities. 

Thanks to that man, his family and their church, I have not been able to move on for years. Every time I am left alone with an older man, or any man that I don't know, I get panicky."
"Love how Christians think they're above everyone while looking down on others, but they sit there defending child predators and excusing them. The hypocrisy is unreal. They're disgusting for letting that monster continue working there, and endorsing the behavior."
One more reason religion should be banned. It starts wars and devastates families
"Interesting. 
As soon as I hear the word 'Christian '
Red flag straight away. 
Evil cruel people they are using God as a reason to make their acts acceptable. 
It's against everything God would want."
Such a disgusting organization. This is a religious for you parents.
"I wonder if Kanakuk has any connections with Agape in Stockton, Mo?"
"Thanks for a fantastic video!

All hail the Algorithm"
"I went to Kanakuk (male)/Kanakomo (female) for 5 years between the ages of 8 & 13 (skipped a summer) for the month long session each time, and it was always amazing. This video deeply saddens me and hurts my heart. One thing I hate about getting older (in my mid 40s) is the absolute shattering of all the illusions of human decency I held true for so long. People can be absolutely disgusting and disgraceful. 
I will remember my time at Kanakomo fondly. I loved my summers spent there; however, now those memories will be tainted by this new knowledge. Heartbreaking!  
Release the victims from their nda's. It's the right thing to do"
"The people who exploit the Christian religion to do evil will be judged by god, this camp does not represent the bible or real Christians for anyone who has that fucked up."
If a god was here I promise you that he would hate you
"I mean, all these complaints sound legit, but the lady that had the ""Proof of Covid-19 vaccination required to enter"" poster on her house lost all credability.  Im sure she's one of the crazies that demands EVERYONE be forced to receive the mysterious injection."
"Goddamn i hate this so much. People using ""religion"" to just do whatever they want, and if someone speaks up about it, break them down using lawyers and money. 
I sincerely hope that Hell exists, so that these people may rot in the deepest circles of Hell."
The fact that they would defend the abuser at all says everything.  Why weren't these people arrested?
"Apart from these pseudoreligious cult leaders deserving a rope, the parents' first mistake was sending kids to a christian camp in the 1st place."
Not surprised at all. Pedophiles are often straight cis and religious.
Wtf
Seems about white.
"Naming the camp ""Can I Cuck"" and it abbreviating to KKK should've been kind of a red flag."
Religion tends to get a pass on a lot of evil
"After Dunblane and the uncovering of a former police officer, who became a minister after he was quietly retired from his police role, was found to be abusing young people in his vestry, turned out abuse was why the police let him go,  the CofS tightened up on all staff and volunteers recruited. All had to go through police checks and noone is ever left alone with a child each church as a named safeguzrding panel who report any disclosures  to the police Always 2 adults on duty.  Every year since its been reviewed as has the code of conduct and tightened up again.  We redo checks every year to make sure noses remain clean."
Isn't it amazing how many religious organizations hurt molest and worse children... They're supposed to be the most caring best examples of humanity but so often we continue to find they're the worst and they only cover up what their own do
NDAs should be illegal in cases like this where it's abuse especially of children you should be able to warn other parents because all of the leaders are still there that decided to keep him they all should be fired
I think all men who defend a man who has multiple multiple accusations and proof that he's doing things like this need to be looked into because if they don't think it's a problem they're doing similar things or they look away from a lot of similar things
There is literally nothing redeeming about the evangelical faith. They're all a bunch of lunatics.
A lot of Christians hate consenting adult gay people so how come can they look away when young boys are being molested? Makes no sense to me
why are there so many sicko pedo's in this world?
rapist priests need to go to prison.
"I all ways hear pedos are in these religious groups and they cover for each other!!!!!  Catholic, Christian in fact all of them"
"NEVER, EVER SEND A KID TO A RELIGIOUS CAMP!!!"
I'd become a murderer of everyone who worked there
I went to a Christian camp. Luckily it was a very good camp that treated us all very well. I can't believe this could happen these things really put a dirty word on religion.
"Vice should cover gitmo again and how it is a big permanent stain on American ""justice system"""
Religion destroys minds.
Religion poisons everything.  Religion is effectively a cultural parasite.
"Welcome to Christianity, people! The religion of peace"
"I'm a survivor too.  I have notes around that say positive affirmations, ""you are strong, you are beautiful, you are more than what you've survived.""  Keep em on stickies onmy phone. In the past I had a lot of self hate, I've made a lot of self destructive decisions. It's so hard to reach a point of any semblance of healing. To anyone reading this, read whats in my quotes out to yourself, even if you dont believe it. This can never define you, because you are strong."
Religion is a business . if you dont realise that then you're stupid.
Damn man you feel so bad for the victims especially at the end of video.Very emotional.My heart poured out.Chomos absolutely ruin innocent kids minds.They will NEVER be the same after such  horrific traumatizing abuse.So confusing and angering that there's people that do this kind of stuff. I know it's a form of mental illness because not everybody is like that naturally in fact most/marjority of people arent wired that way but still that kind of thing should at least be managed and dealt with properly somehow throughout their lives if they want to stay out of some mental institution!
"I used to be decently religious but I took a step back when I realized many in the community were pointing fingers at the wrong ""sinners"" (ex: LGBT people and people of other religions), when the real sinners were higher up's like the disgusting men in this video"
"A maulvi (some sort of an Islamic teacher) from India abused young boys at a madressa (Muslim Sunday school) here in Mozambique in the 1960s. The guy was beaten to death by the parents of those kids. I don't understand how parents can send their own children to these places by themselves, let alone after hearing about the abuse going on there. It really blows my mind."
"Then it wasn't a christan camp then now was it! I sick and tired of these groups like the Mormons/Jehovah witnesses and the Catholic being called christan. No real BIBLE believing born again christan would ever hurt anyone, especially a child. We follow the LORD JESUS CHRIST and him alone. Don't mix us up with them"
"Taking advantage of children during a bible study session is another level of evil.  Makes me feel so sick when I think about it.  And anyone who try's to cover up or make excuses for the abusers are JUST AS BAD as the predators.  

Sorry to everyone who suffered - no one should have to experience this stuff in life.  It really hurts hearing that these things can happen.  I can't imagine how the victims feel.    Try stay strong everyone."
This is so disgusting and my heart goes out to the victims. That excuse that the abuse was a drop in the bucket of good is SICK!!!
"While this was happening....the state was coming and taking Indigenous boys from my reservation and others, illegally, and taking them there. The state was sending our boys to a religious camp on the states dime even after these law suits were filed. Think about that!!"
"Who in the hell are these people who supporting this Newman guy? The one guy was asked why he wasn't immediately fired after forcing kids to ride 4 wheelers naked, and play basketball ball naked, described it as ""immature decision making"".

Bruh SERIOUSLY!?!?"
What a weirdo 9:20.  The CEO saying he is SUCH a great guy.  Prob touches children himself doesn't understand the magnitude of pedophilia.
That hellhole of a camp needs to be shut down ASAP.
Congress needs to outlaw sexual abuse NDAs.
So its okay at church but not at camp lmao!!
This is why my son has never been to any camp even though he would benefit from one especially where he could learn survival skills.  I just can't drop him off like that.  And me teaching him outdoor stuff is like pulling a tooth to him I don't know what to do!
"I'm sorry but why are these parents contacting just the camp and not the police as well? To be clear the camp and the leadership are absolutely at fault for what they did to the children not the parents, especially since the parents could only react after the abuse had already happened and only if their kids let them know, but I really think they should have called 911."
Joe White A.K.A the Botox Champ!
Parent are in on it too.
Still believe.?
"Wait what? So parents essentially paid for their kids to get abused. It will never cease to amaze me how these so called men/women of God choose abusers over kids time & time again. After finding out, they facilitate & make it easier 4abusers to keep on abusing. They chastise the kids.... Pliz tell me what's Godly about that."
Religious people are disgusting
I hope more people put pressure on this company to change. I have.
"Breaks my heart learning about this. I hope this ""evil"" place closes."
"They aren't being ""kept silent"". They signed NDEs so they could get cash."
"How unfair and disgusting , I cannot believe this camp is still open for business . I would have never looked it up except this morning on a local news station sports mentioned Link academy Branson being in the running for basketball championships in curiosity I looked up link academy and found it was a part of Kanakuk organization and there was lots of posts about this horrible despicable crime against children as well as reports of great wealth and deception by charitable watch agencies by the owners and leadership of this camp . I read all these reports with sad heart that all this is a Christian /bible based camp (a wolf in sheep's clothing ) I'm in shock about all this , I live near Branson Missouri and never heard of any of this"
religions are obviously getting exposed. this is ridiculous
This is sickening
Someone I know was molested by their pastor. The rest of the church closed ranks and basically shamed the family out of the church. Because it was a small town nothing was done. Eventually his family moved to the city and never looked back.
Parents pay thousands of dollars for their child to be raped and molested.
Whoa how has that creepy looking creep not been investigated
Fuckin perf jail fo lyfeeeee
To be honest that's the problem with religions it's all for the wrong reason but sold as the right way and thing to do. its all manipulation
how can any parent trust their kids with complete strangers just because they believe in the same religion? why would you let your kids sleep at a grown mans house unsupervised? the guy is a monster but these parents are also at fault.
Christian's will be Christian's..
Newman!
The devil is real
"If you guys are willing to hand off the raising of your kids to strangers without ensuring that their behavior is sensible, then I believe it is inevitable for barbarism to become the norm.

It is unfortunate to say this, but people need to learn how to be aware of their surroundings, identify possible threats, and plan for the possibility of needing to escape or to defend themselves."
"ofc not the parents responsible but this is what happens at churches, and cristian camps"
These christian camps should be nuked.
Those who did this ain't no Christians. They will suffer
"I'm afraid to speak out about my trauma in another facility, because they threatened to frame me with the worst crimes imaginable. They've done it to other people. These were kids who left with fake records and years' long sentences for trying to stop abuse. They want to keep children in the program because they get thousands of dollars a month for each of us, so I was locked up with rapists and violent sadists."
"All respect to all that father for keeping it together enough not to beat to death with a blunt object anyone that physically did anything along with all complicit that after hearing 20 seconds of their bullshit pissed me off so bad I had to stop watching,"
"The Devil Attacks Christian Places More than Any Other Place,  Because He Hates Christ,  So He Tries to Ruin Anything to Do With Christ 
We Must Pray For Our Enemies,  As Christians,  That's What the Word Says,  I Wouldn't Wish Hell On My Worst Enemy...I Would Hope They Repent and Be Healed of this Vicious Cycle."
It's some kind of a Christian Camp sounds more like the devil's torture chamber.
Shocker
In other words they need to have a zero tolerance and stuff like this it's ridiculous to me that it's even a thing
I never understand this kind of stuff I understand that your religious but if anything the fact that you're so religious should be the reason why the moment you hear about this s*** someone should be put on leave that should be done in investigation and if there's anything the points to it being true then it be fired and you need to be filing charges against them
It takes a lot of courage I appreciate these parents and survivors for speaking out!!! I wonder if a Nda is only for a certain time period ? Could someone go back to court and say they want to take back there agreement after they signed it ?
"I'm an immigrant, so letting my kid go anywhere overnight isn't happening."
How can they be sued for breaking an NDA if it is about criminal behaviour??
"THANK YOU for speaking out, at such risk.  Thank you."
IS THIS PLACE CLOSED ALREADY????' HOPE SO....
9:20 2 drops of water in a cascade...that'd be like 2 drops of urine in my lemonade. Not cool at all
"""Imature behavior"". Are you kidding me? Like its something most imature people do from time to time. Its pedofhilia, the worst thing you can do."
All about saving face to keep making lots of money. Kids are humans and need legal rights too
Religion rots society
"This is a picture of ""In God we Trust. """
Stay away from christians
"Always remember they hate you and will not help you better this world, it WILL be better without them"
Wolves in sheep clothing amen
...
"Best to just take your own kid and family to camp together. Why risk to put them around adult strangers who you don't know well for a whole entire week? Some of the most perverted, abusive people hide behind religions too. It's so disturbing."
Always church people
Organized religion is poison
Sounds like maybe the upper echelon indulged a little too
"The saddest thing is, this isn't all that uncommon for Christian summer camps. I don't know what it is about evangelicals, but they attract some really evil people."
No one was tipped off at the words Christian Summer Camp? Gross.
I grew up in Las Vegas.. Lots of Mormons.. The one family I got close to I used to get stomach aches at their house every time I was over there.. In 8th grade I was friends with their son.. we stole some beers one day and he tells me his father had been raping him and his brothers their entire life.. and to stay away from them and their father.. He is gay now.. Their dad was also involved in local government.. i had to see his face on poster board ads telling people to vote for him.. I day dreamed about murdering him for years.
The camp leadership needs to be fired and the camp sold away.
Parents still sent their kids there knowing these accusations?? Unbelievable
"Never let Christians near children, ever."
8:10-8:55- This part pissed me off. You knowing knew that he was doing things that were beyond unacceptable and illegal and you still kept him. And the fact that this camp is still running today is such an insult. And what is this idiot smiling in this interview?
Why are any parents still allowing religious leaders unrestricted access to their children?!
"Go on Google Maps and review all of their camps in Missouri, they need to be exposed. Unfortunately, most of the delusional religious parents submitting good reviews are part of the problem. Pathetic religious people..too indoctrinated by a religious cult that tells them that resurrections and prophecies are real. Imagine being that stupid..just imagine."
Religion is a disease.
Evangelicals are the problem. All of them. Not just the the camp administration.
This is NOT what Christianity is!
"kids that need help are the ones that end up in shitty situations like this, it's just horrible"
"Funny how they purposefully called it immature actions but they never called it a crime, which is what it is. This is one aspect of christianity I hate. Some christian be all out in condemning homosexuality but be totally quiet when they're the culprits."
This is so typical. Christians hiding and covering up what the leaders do to kids. The people who run the church are sexual abusers simply by not stopping it. That means they enjoy it in their own secrecy. Turn that place into a parking lot with the church and its leaders under the pavement.
These people actually have the audacity to call gay people perverts when these are the people they hire.   You can't expect people who try to beat the gay out of gay people to understand that a man who is a pedophile will continue to be be a pedophile.  People who pray on children are the lowest form of  life.
I have 2 coworkers that this happened to.
"Religion is deceitful. 
Be humane than religious."
"I went to an evangelical school, from grade school to high school.  All those years made me realize I'm really a humanist, and I am now generally aversed by anything religious."
"Christian summer camps schools and such like boy scouts and reform homes for youth are just a pedophiles heaven run by a toxic sick culture within Catholic society with a smattering of other church organisations you get no justice that you have to take for yourself, no respective govt has done so  before during or after so do it yeah"
"West Coast Wizards magic camp in the 90s

Multiple kids abused by magician Bob Markwood. He abused friends of mine, acted inappropriate around me while his wife was only a few rooms away."
Christianity is a cesspool of child abuse and molestation. It's not just big camps like this one. I went to a tiny little Baptist summer camp in south Georgia (Valdosta by way of Loganville's Victory Baptist Church) and returned home changed forever for the worse.
"These criminals should be made an example of, castration for starters than humiliation in the public eye, they should have no rights ever again their lives should be made MISERABLE until the day they die! You can't trust anything these days if you have children you better find a way to do these activities with them yourself cuz this is the world we live in now look around yourselves this is no isolated event it's happening openly everywhere."
Dont leave your kids alone along Christian stuff
Good glad this camp got called out.
"I don't know why people trust these ""Evangelicals"". Also, why is this place still open? It should be SHUT DOWN! NOW!"
hot tub bible studies sounds like an ayesha erotica song title
How many people are praying for them?? Lol did god send the abuser also??? No right?? That was the devil lol churches are the perfect place for evil to hide.
"Even without this, every child being indoctrinated into religion, is being abused."
"I didnt suffer sexual abuse there, but I did suffer sexual abuse within a Christian family and the way they went about dealing with it was absolutely toxic. I am so sorry to these brave young men for what thru have experienced. What sucks here is that abuse like this doesn't just taint your relationship with your abuser, with sex, with yourself, but with God, the church, summer, camp, etc. It's horrible."
Screw that do not ever sign! I'm sorry for your son and the others! Heartbreaking!
All kid camps have this problem I say stop camps in general
"Hi everyone, so many awesome conversations in this chat! That was me in the documentary^^^

I would like to continue adding a media aspect to this conversation surrounding this camp and our stories.  More information and truth was said in this documentary that did not make the cut. If any of you have information, ideas, connections or experience on how to continue with raising awareness through video, please let me know. I would love to expand on questions in this chat, bring clarity to the situation, while also celebrating those who are survivors for speaking truth, fighting for their life, and overcoming what this camp put us through. Now is the time for life-giving and wholesome conversation to happen. I do not have an NDA and want to utilize that as much as possible. We as a collected people can overcome evil in this world. 

My faith in and relationship with Christ has never been stronger. I would also love to expand on that, as Jesus has brought complete healing in my life. Do I still feel pain from this, absolutely. Am I still angry at the situation and people responsible? Yes, absolutely. However, I am not controlled by them, my anger, medications, and PTSD. Christ has set me free from this and also embolden me to fight for justice. 

Even if you do not agree with the facts or find it difficult to decern between what we are exposing vs how the camp is responding...I want to talk with you as well. Let's have these conversations. But let them aim at the main goal of seeking justice and healing for us victims.

Please let me know of any resources for raising awareness with video or audio (podcast). Thank you."
Christianity is the most sexually repressed religion ever second only to islam.
Why when you search the camp this video doesn't come up on Google??! The camp is still first. People send their kids there and will summer 2022. WOW.
"Church has more pedos than any prison, it seems."
"Shocker, Christian summer camp = Molestation."
Anyone ever go to the zoo and be shocked to see animals?
Why wouldn't the parents have reported it to the police? Reporting it just to the camp is like reporting a priest to the Catholic Church.
"""he was a great camp counselor, except for the times he touched kids...""
oh yes, and Jeffrey Dahmer was a great neighbour, if you don't mind dismembered bodies showing up every now and then."
the tepidity of their language surprises me
"Babysitters, schoolteachers, daycare, its ALWAYS , going to be a job type thing that gives scumbags access to kids. Why aren't parents more careful with their kids?"
Disgusting
Coaching kids....wow
"I was sent to a private Christian school where I was abused by another male from ages 12-17. I then moved on to heavy benzo use and then heavy opiate/heroin use on top of that. I have no idea how I'm still alive. My parents knew something was going on with me so they approached the school several times and they denied everything despite knowing most of it. I've been off the drugs 2 years now but it's been hell. I'm in my early 30's and it's a struggle every single day, it's horrific and it's a ghost that never leaves you. Pigs."
Pure MAGA. And anyone who says otherwise is a liar.
this should be a 40 minute doccumentary
"This camp needs shut down asap even if only 1 child was harmed shut it down!, only responsible thing to do if they cared and they have shown they dont !"
These people are sick
