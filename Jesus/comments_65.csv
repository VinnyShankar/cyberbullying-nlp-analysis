I listen to this while I work. Something about listening to his voice keeps me calm.
I don't think I'll ever get over ol' Bobbos overarching humility and humble nature - his constant preach that - it's so easy. No it isn't!
A true classic never goes out of style.. The world was robbed of him. He was truly a gift..
Hi bob can you paint something with a water fall next time?
RIP Bob Ross 1942-1995
bob YOU are natures masterpiece and the greatest one to ever live. rest in peace my brother you always got a place in my heart
He painted better than real life
This is so calming to watch.
Amazing tutorial I'll  try to make it
It was never his painting it was always our painting

"I wonder, does Bob Ross offer his paintings for sale?"
His relaxing voice gives me goosebumps
I love how chilled he is
"I have a question and hope for an answer

Does he erase the board with a white color before drawing? Or not"

These are the painting that i would buy for millions not those kg kid's paintings.
Genuine question what makes this episode so much popular than the rest?  Not trying to start anything. Just genuinely asking.
Listening to his voice and the things he says while watching his work is very soothing and relaxing

Nice work
I LKOVE YOU BOB ROSS
My Daughter Tashelle and I really enjoyed watching your painting

My brother once said that anyone can copy a bon ross painting but only a true artist can paint their own

"Imagine Bob Ross pulls you out of the water, puts a band aid on you, performs CPR and throw you back in the water"
"""and in our world, we can do anything that we want to do here. Any ol' thing""

Words clear as sunlight piercing through the darkest clouds. I can never express the torment inside my mind through words alone. I have never painted before, maybe this is a sign."
"I stumbled on these old Bob Ross videos and I've been addicted to them for the last 24 hours, I literally can't stop watching em"
"This video has 44 MILLION views lol. Man, he would be a golden god in this era."
I have never watched Bob Ross before and find the whole experience to be unfathomably wholesome and relaxing.
When I watch Bob Ross it a asmr
Bob Bro is teaching how to paint canvas and life with colours. Time is 3:22 am as i write this comment. This is beautifull.
Is this channel operated by the people who usurped Bob Ross' brand from him and just took over the entire legacy as if they owned it?
Just AMAZING.....Directly from Heaven
0:20 He committed murder

This guy is amazing. He definitely has a gift. As a kid I was bored by this show watching it with my grandma. Now I can't admire Bob Ross enough. He had a gift and painting was that. He could paint a perfect picture effortlessly. RIP Bob Ross a true artist.

"I came here just to see how the canvas looked at the start, I had something else to do. And yet, before I knew it, here I was watching through, observing how as an artist, sometimes some of your art looks odd at the start until a slight flick of a pen, or a beat of a brush makes the whole thing much better. I am a pen user more than an actual painter, but he made me want to paint more now, as landscapes are much better to make with paint than pens. He is the prophet of painting, because he showed me the way ! God bless you too my friend. :)"

The thing is he knows what color is gonna come on the canvas and  how it will come before doing it ...aaaaaah he is fucking talented

His gentle way of talking while enjoying the paint takes you to his own world with a smile on your face
"why in the hell this get so many dislikes??

human race is doomd"
"""Alright folks for those of you who cant pause this show back in the 70s/80s, I already went ahead and covered my canvas with liquid white and I'm going to get started so you can never catch up to where I'm at in this painting."" Good luck folks"
is it just my toxic trait or is it my mind telling me I can do this because he makes it look like painting was easy
Excellent
Rhe Best asmr
So he abused paint brushes i knew he had an evil side. Lol
there is one thing he did not talk about how good of a painter he is
I used to watch Bob Ross and he was a very good painter. He made it look so easy and all his paintings are very beautiful.
The world was robbed of him. He was truly a gift.
No idea why or how this was in my recommended but I'm smiling the entire time while watching it
How real masculinity looks to me
loved it  -  - again!
Bob Ross was like chicken soup for the soul.
The movie  PAINT  brought me here...
Bob Ross was creating ASMR long before it was cool.
"First time watching this guy,
Don't know anything about painting. 

What a wholesome guy. I had smile on my face the whole time"
Wow!
Cannibal island?
"6:25.
That shows his passion for his art.
Miss you Bob but happy you and your art entertained our world."
"If you had a day full of tension stress and the day seemed like it was never going to end with such. All I needed to do was turn on either PBS when they were televising a Bob Ross show or go online and watch this man and with his voice tone, his means of describing the painting it is the best relaxing and calming agent anyone could ever want or need. This man was a true genius in all aspects."
The Master.
Do y'all not know he was a murderer?
bro erased himself from existence
"I adore Bob Ross but 30 years ago one couldn't fill  pallette of paint and brushes like that for $500. 
Imagine doing this same endeavor at today's prices? It would be likened to dipping a brush into caviar."
"Bob's voice, soothing and calm.

Bob's movement's: VROOM!"
"His videos could also be considered ASMR content, for sure."
Bob Ross has earned his place on Mount Olympus....
"Last night I was woken up at three in the morning by a loud thunderstorm. I was freaked out so I tried to find something to listen to to calm me down, and I found this in my recommendeds. I had never watched Bob Ross so I was s bit surprised to see him on here. I put this on and I fell asleep listening to it. I love this guy."
He makes it look so simple .
That first painting shows you just how much of a magician Bob was with the paint. Remarkable.
Bob Ross for sainthood
Bob Ross you are God
first time here... I am blown away
amsr god and great painter!! i remember being bullied at school and living a lot of fighting at home and everytime i would watch him i would drift into beautiful dreams and feel surrounded by calmness and peace
I can't say a word that hasn't been said...just what a treasure...I was so happy to live while he was here...
Seems like a nice enough bloke but those paintings are truly awful
I cllicked the link to a video about sexual reproduction why am I here-
Absolutely unbelievable Perfection and talent so so amazing!
"He isn't just a painter, he is a hero without a cape, and a wise man"

Thank you
"20:27 ""We had to walk all through through these bushes, *maskeeters* would get us, so let's have us..."" What's a *maskeeter* ? A *mosquito* ?"
Is anyone going to talk about how Bob got killed by what I can only describe as an alternate universe Bob?
"Cool, si great artwork"
"He is the greatest painter in history, he will be for ever known."
Why is nobody talking about how in every episode intro he erases a clone of himself from existence
Rip legend
I wonder why this is the most viewed episode. Is this Bob in his prime? Is this the first episode ever uploaded?
Hola
I remember being around 8 years old sitting on the floor in front of the TV watching his shows.

The. Movie of Bob Ross is coming
bob shows how good of a painter you can be.
"Bop videos were broadcast to children on TV for a few years in Turkey. Everyone born in the 90s in our country knows Bob and his painting. If you hear anything about painting and philosophy from a Turkish man, it's probably Bob's work, even from the sidelines. Thanks Bob. for teaching us that even a tree, even a picture, doesn't want to be alone"
True artist and teacher  at the same time.
"It's not possible. I was watching some video skates on this my girlfrind accounts, and I was thinking ""oh man, watch this is as beautiful as watch Bob Ross paiting, it's been a while since then..."" I just tought!! I even didn't say it on lound, and never watched Bob Ross on her account, in fact, i didn't watch him since before we start dating. Anyway, thanks youtube for reading my mind and bring me back to 
this"

"Damn lake ilinalta looking good, this painting was when he toured Skyrim"
14:22 he accidentally dropped the fan brush on the ground so he suddenly use another fan brush to paint
"What happened to these types of shows that showcased positive personalities like Bob Ross who encouraged you to do positive things?  I guess, technology didn't help us much, did it?  I see lots of retards watching and making tik-tok videos for entertainment who encourage nothing but stupidity."

"I watched Bob when I was a child but not a lot. So why did I tear up watching this a little? This man was a national treasure, right there with Mr. Rogers"
man i remember back in the day when i have trouble sleeping i watched Ross's videos because his voice and sound were so calm..Now im watching it for his incredible paintings which i can't believe it took him a half an hour to do so
I sometimes wish I could have nothing in mind but the time of day and year
0:00 to 0:28 Bob had better cgi in 1993 than marvel today.
The most beautiful painting I've ever seen and it also inspire me to make a masterpiece like he did
I wish he was still alive
"My brother recomended me this, and because of his video i can sleep/make me sleepy when i can't sleep at night"
Nice
these vidoes are meditation in their own
if he was my art teacher i swear everyone in the class gonna sleep
"I have a question, is he using watercolors or oleos or acrilic paints? I'm sorry but I got confused and I really want to follow this video and as you can see I'm not an expert:( help pls"
his voice/accent is sooo relaxing
Also the master of ASMR
He coulve been done in the first 4 or 5 minutes and I would have been fine with it..
"is it just me that can watch these and sleep for hours with the master's voice?

Bob ross was and still is number1!!!!
"I always cry after watching his videos, he was very sweet."
"I'ma being honest
this part at 6:35 is actually pretty satisfying 
where he mixes up the colors with the knife :D"
Bob Ross a raspberry
"few years back, i watched every single episode of every season on yt, i stopped at this season. i used to paint all the time but then some tragic events happened in my life and i stopped, that was back in 2018 and havent painted since. it is now 2023 and i have found peace and watching this has made me inspired to paint once again. i hope there is a heaven up there because this great man would be there. he has put most of our lives into a new light and that is worth cherishing"
"when this man says lets have some fun hes serious like deafcon 1 ""bobs gonna paint a mountain"" the war of happy accidents will happen a war of peace and all trees join together and unite under the bob ross democracy of happy little trees."
"sometimes i am sad sometimes i stand up against the evil annette and sometimes i cry hes not with us huh so much sorrow when we should accept his great happy little simple detailed great but no presiure or need to be a van gogh i painted paintings and gave them to the principle at my elementary

rest in all the peace in the world

I just noticed that this maybe the world's first Asmr
"Never watched Bob Ross before, currently studying and periodically looking at the screen and all I can say is I wish he was still living. R.I.P big guy"
You make me so tiring because your voice is so relaxing so when I go to bed I'm going to listen to you paint
he would've been the coolest grandpa ever
He would be the single best asmrtist
He's reverse Hitler
"I get bored very easily, but this is just amazing to see how talented a human can be. (I just finished eating 2 pancakes) and then my daughters found this video and this impacted me a lot. God bless you."
"His voice make me sleepy, i like it"
It's an honor to see the master bring life to canvas

"I took up painting after watching Bob Ross.   I always had some talent, but didn't like the time it took to do.  When I saw him do them in 30 minutes, I became less afraid that it would be too time consuming.   That was 2 years ago.  I have since done 26 oil paintings just spending a couple hours on a weekend once every month or so.  I still can't do them in 30 minutes like Ross, but then again some of mine have people or animals in them that take longer. ( I don't do just landscapes.)   But I picked up several great tips from Ross, especially doing water, and reflection on the water as he does here.   I couldn't paint water until I watched him !"
Very Talented
I have always liked how he just keeps it simple with not a lot of detail and no over-explaining
I share my birthday with bob ross

Did I just see a man murdered in the first 30 seconds of the episodes
I wanna be crazy like you bob
Gosh. This is ASMR before ASMR existed. I can find true calm and inner peace via Bob Ross.
Idk guys I think he likes big ol tree
"""Everyone should have a friend. Even a tree needs a friend,"""
AO3 USERS HOW WE FEELING RN?
HELP AO3 IS DOWN
hey ao3 readers hru???
Only here because AO3 is down
I wonder where the money from this acc goes
"if every teacher was like bob ross, everyone would want to learn"
"he was always missing a finger on his left hand, covered by the color pallet"
I love his voice so much it's calm positive and polite makes me want to fall asleep
"Someone once commented on this very same Chandel that God must have been a good day when he created Bob. The goods always go early. God bless the World free of hatred and wars, but just kindness. In Jesus's name I pray. Amen."
"It's insane knowing this guy used to be a drill sergeant. Like imagine him yelling in your face every day for years, day and night, rain or shine, and then later on in life, you see him as an incredibly soft-spoken painter"
"If you happen to fall asleep watching the joy of painting, you just might meet bob ross in your dreams."
"Thanks Bob,much respect!!"
His birthday is October 29th
Why do the tree reflections look so good though????
Can I do this in acrylic also?
I like the ones with the intro song.
He's the Bob Ross
"R.I.P to one of the world's painting legend, Bob Ross."
he so easy drawing master piece.
Anyone else here trying to fall asleep
no AI painting would be able to replicate this
The vibes
I can't unhear freddie dredd
I feel like Bob Ross had alot of fun with that very first scene
Good job
He is just a therapist
"""In maybe in our world there lives...., does now.""  Love it !!!!!!!!!!"
Better afro than mine
Season 29 in 1993?
18:57 i think is God using you to draw prettiful afternoons
Use to watch Bob on Sat. afternoons. Beautiful times and paintings.
"18:33 ""And he's got a little friend named Clyde.""
There's something about the way he delivers that line that i just really like."
Rest in peace bob ross
This is ASMR of its own
a bush called Clyde
Thus probably the only person that is wholesome and so is his comment section
"There is so much beauty and grace in this. It truly is joy. What an amazing man, he blessed us all."
There is something about this guy that makes you believe.
"""we don't make mistakes here, we have happy accident"""
Bob Ross is the reason why i started appreciating landscapes and still life paintings
I don't see how the cameramen stayed awake.
Thank you for the most wonderful experience.  I enjoyed doing this with you online.
He is the Yasser Seirawan of painters
No intencional asmr
WOW.
bob happy = world happy
My mom had anger issues as a kid and my grandma would make her watch him to help calm down and it did help
"How he just says ""something about like so"" is just so calming and I don't know why"
"Nice to sit down and watch, very calming, he sounds very enthusiastic.  Gotta love it"
Rest in paint
After more than  20 years still watch his videos
"When I was 5 years old, I would sit in front of the tv and watch him paint with my mouth open like little kids would do."
something like so
"I wish to be so good and confident in my skill some day, that i can create as easly as him, without weeks of planning and careful thought into everything. He of course also had to start somewhere, and it probably took a lot of effort and passion to get there, but you know what i mean. He was and is still so inspiring to watch and listen to. His philosophy on life and in art."
Just from all the wonderful comments about bob tells me he was Loved by all me included rest Easy mr. Bob Ross .
Just beat the devil out of it
Hi
"Rest in peace , bob Ross"
Wow  just wow ...is Amazing how this gentleman makes painting looks easy.  I can watch this all day

"""We don't make mistakes here, we have happy accidents."""
How in the hell was this gentle kind man a US Drill Sergeant???
I love your painting
"The man was a genius. And he was just pure happiness and love. I can't paint for shapoopy, but he makes me feel like a superhero."
"Currently sick, feeling like shit, but Bob Ross always makes me feel better"
Even though I'm a arcrylic artist I have learned alot from Bob Ross especially mixing multiple colors I use the same color names just arcrylic. I painted a picture of Bob Ross I admire him very much he was truly a great man and a amazing artist with the most soothing voice ever.
Makes me sleep wtf

We miss you Bob may you rest in heavenly peace
what if Bob Ross was a serial killer that painted where he buried his victims?
Worlds most lovable man.
I love how he inspired people to paint.
I ain't know ice spice paints
11:29 He said we don't make mistakes just happy accidents...you can apply that not only to painting but to life.
https://youtu.be/fm92EoaNsgQ
"that's the first time I see a tutarial of the famous Bob Ross and I love it from the first minute, watched it till the end without brushes or colors but I promised myself to try this one - I guess I won't be the first ;-)"
9:49

Bob Ross.... The original King of ASMR
Same question Bob Ross is very talented obviously that's painter in the world right now but just curious why did he have that 1970s afro he's doing any shows in 2010? It's only a few years ago 10 years ago
In my 5th grade class a teacher of my would play this
So soothing
that thing he said about imagination is what i needed to hear.
Legend
"I search ""painter in ohio"" and bob ross appears'"
How can 12 thousand people dislike this??
Every time I was watching him I fell in sleep in three minutes. Its even better than counting little sheep
"Bob Ross wasn't just an artist, he was also a poet"
You're the Master. God painted you
I only know the legend of Bob Ross from internet memes. This is the first time I ever saw his video. It almost made me tear up cos he's so wholesome. I don't think it was possible for human to be this wholesome.
it looks like butterfly lake in utah 22:48
I've never really been interested in painting I started painting in kindergarten I've been doing it ever since and I just found out that Bob Ross was just a very good painter and I'm starting to watch it and I have got really inspirational advice from him and it's very cool I love him I wish you could still be alive I'm just very inspirational and I love trying to get people to do their hobbies that they love to do but some people say that they don't do good at it and they say that they're horrible and they stop and they never do it again that's what happened to me I never liked my paintings but now since I've started watching Bob Ross he said that it's not what you want to paint let your mind take over your painting so it's really inspirational I love Bob Ross he's my favorite painter ever please have this comment get pinned please please please please please and if anybody else is painters that don't think they do good please just watch LeBron he's very inspirational and I know you'll love him thank you
hes so calm hes such a w guy
"The way he explains it, the way he enjoys it, such a positive and warm person. 
I've watched so many of your episodes & already painted a lot with you!
Great teacher, not only in painting!
RIP"
I ordered a few classes from him. I love it
"These videos are what's gonna save us from an alien invasion. They're gonna see these and think ""If earth created this man then theres hope for it"""
https://youtu.be/P_TM6N2Is0M
https://www.youtube.com/@shedtalkwithc.j.buchanan9112
I like watching him
"he's the definition of ""trust the process."""
"15:49
let's get crazy"
How are we just gonna watch his videos without saying rip
14:57 man actually just complimented the camera man while working. Come on. You can't fake this dude's attitude. I tell my coworkers to gtfo every day.
Why is it called acrylic paint not canvas paint
He doesn't care about anything. He is in the moment. We should all learn from this.
Is it just me or is Bob Ross the original ASMR
6:09 He paints so good but I can paint to
I like to imagine this is how God created our world.
"Man Nostalgic overload,I loved watching this show when I was a kid."
".

Just died watching Bob Ross
"Today I did my first Bob Ross painting. I still have to practice to make it look decent, but he is just lovely to listen to and I feel like I am learning a lot, fast. Thank you!"
Bro I love the intro
Am I the only one who could fall asleep listening to this man's voice?
Rip legend he wont be forgotten
This guy is my sleeping pill.And I mean this in good way.
"Trash, garbage, kitch."
A true classic never goes out of style.

"imagination it's like other muscle in your body. the more you practice, the better it becomes. Bob Ross"

My drawings in math class-
"My grandma started painting near the end of her life, and this really reminds me of her"
So chill. So gentile. So dope.
"There something about his soft voice and how he paints, its so peaceful"
You help people paint better then they think
"This is the first bob ross painting I've ever watched, it was very nice."
I wish I could have been able to watch his show when he still lived and met him

"in average theres over 10,075 hours of bob ross episodes, and it will take an averaged 416 days to watch all of this. Time to spend a year sitting!"
Bob we miss you
"The nicest thing about Bob Ross's teachings is that he does not overcomplicate the process with very little details, which can make non-artists understand easier when it comes to making their own painting. Sure his paintings looked detailed, but in reality they are all random strokes in harmony."
So sad that he got stabbed in the back in the end like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrtDw3kQGlE
"His true passion and skill for painting. His kindhearted personality. His calm and relaxing voice. All of these things evoke a feeling similar to a warm, cozy blanket on a chilly winter night"
I watched this entire video without my eyes leaving the screen
And good asmr
4:00
top 10 best satisfaction video that ca drive you to deep dream
Fun Fact: Bob Ross successfully conquered the forces of hell by beating devils out of paint brushes for over 40 years.
Honestly i play his videos and go sleep
It's just satisfaction
"I like how he gives really practical tips and techniques to easily execute a thing or another, but also tells you to let your imagination do its thing because ""it's your world, you can do whatever you want"". This is why I love these videos."
4:04 I too am dry after just beating it
Bobbbb

I've recently gotten back into painting. I love it. I grew up watching Bob
He used 2 different colours and it already looked better that what I have ever made
