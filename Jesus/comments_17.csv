No one gonna mention how often Scarlett peaks back at Chris?
Leonardo DiCaprio
Marvel movies are special because (almost) every actor in them is the perfect fit for their roles. They're not just acting and trying to be like them. They ARE THEM!!!
Sealed
"It touched me 
It blew me away"
Spectacular

Crazy to believe this energy is now gone from marvel. The OGs all together will never be repeatable and it shows in current films
Interview?? Really? Wow!!
Good video
Downy definitely dresses like a Cormier addict
What presents rich people get for other rich people football teams blimps in tickets for movies
Scarlet kinda looks like Taylor Swift
The way they all stop clapping and then all start yelling again
I wanna go back to these years
Chris <3
Paul Rudd's savage replies
"Wow, Tony's child's bday is just one day ahead my bday."
Jimmy always sounds tipsy to me
RDJ is no longer RDJ but is tony stark
This was so awkward and disjointed.
Chris Hemsworth can give me a tape and I will pass it as an heirloom for generations
MAYBE!!!?
Scarlett just dropped the biggest spoiler ever 1:39 and no one realized it...

"Dear Avengers

I'm so used to worrying I have no idea what to worry about anymore.

I spent all this time concerned about the future and now the future is here

I don't know what to do anymore.

I mean i do.

But this feels great.

I just hope i don't mess it up.

I have enough money to take care of myself for a while.

I'm going to be ok and i know it now.

It feels good. I'm not used to it.

I'm just used to being stressed it's become a part of me.

I hope sophie can fix me.

Wow. No debt that's a first in 5 or 7 years.

Today I ate at a restuarant on king's street hammersmith london UK...Called ""Brown Rice""

My stomach was so full of good food i started crying. Can you believe that the food was so good

I started to cry.

Then she gave me a great milkshake full of good nutrients

Also

Asia women are Hotoooooooooooooo

People have no idea how to appericate their beauty.

So Hot.

P.s Scarlet you deserve Ghost in the shell.

Take it. It's quite an honour.

You must have done something good.

Any That's me

Jafar...Worry FREE'

This was awesome and then I see Brie Larson's face in that clip :\
This is what you came for 7:54
"I thought Scarlett Johansson was Amber heard, and the guy that plays Iron Man was Johnny Depp..."
04:58 - 7:18
This conversation feels and sound familiar after awhile
"Chris Hemsworth: I'm her hero

*also the one who put her in danger*"
7:55 friend from work line origin  - thor Ragnarok

I needed to encourage you if not I wouldn't have survived.

I don't feel the way I should do because of the way I grew up

see that...

I'll try not to do it again."
"you know him as Ant-Man, I know him as Crap Bag :D aka Mike from FRIENDS"
"I LOVE the cute moment in the beginning when Rdj, Chris, and Paul moved to the side for Scarlett could go first. Truly respecting ""ladies first"" We need more gentlemen like them in the world"
Robert is da bomb
frank castle >>>>>>
"Actually what Jimmy said about messing with Thanos's brain, Atom did it with Darkseid in Rock of Ages arc."

U really need good wits to b in these interviews without spoiling anything.
Can the crowd shut up for just a few seconds
6:17 scarlett and chris <3

Well the audience had a long cheer at the beginning
Jimmy kimmel asked very less questions to paul rudd. Felt very bad.
10:35
"robert:""no, not in the slightest""
me: u sure abt tht?"
7:30 on which scene at Iron Man 2 is it?
poser
Scarlett looks grt in literally every hairstyle
"8:56 and this, my friends, is his you start to hate a character"
"I honestly was believing the Birthday Presents but then when They said they Got Tony a Super Yatch I busted out Laughing Hard, AND THEN CHRIS PULLS OUT THE TAPE
Bro this whole part of the Video made me die"
When conan interviewed some of the other cast....that was a million times better lol
7:32
"When Paul Rudd said last time on the show ,i laughed hard"
"The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. (2 Peter 3:9)
Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions. Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me. Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest. (Psalms 51:1-4)"
I was today years old when I realize that scarlett had that spoiler at 1:39 and she and robert both laughed while the world cried
Such a boring host...
rdj being the best pls
Well thanos snapped on earth. Guess she should have been there.
"OMG, my birthday is the same day as Exton(RDJ's son)"

I love that all brown look
"Cap: ""Let's go get this son of a b*tch""

Dust Fury: ""Whoa you kissed your mother with that mouth?"""
11:41 (Zip) and 11:53 (MAYBE??)
"Watching this on 2022, missing these interviews with such a great cast."
"Jimmy Kimmel: ""Does something bad happen to Iron Man?"" 
RDJ: ""Not in the slightest.""
Us after watching endgame: HOW COULD U LIE TO US?!"
Maybe!
10:08 he lied straight to our faces HSNSHA YSGVSIHAB

.

With the holy spirit only u doing this without god we are ntg u.scscccc"
""" I Am IRON MAN"" . Nuff said"
its hard to believe Paul Rudd is 50 years old!
I wonder where rdj ends and Tony stark starts
"These people seem fine in an interview, but I think if I were to be on set or hang out with any of them, I'd hate them, their cash, attitudes, and the super yacht they rode in on. I feel like they are all awesome to each other as fellow millionaires, and A list actors, but whatever. Never gonna happen."
paul is actually scott i swear
Paul Rudd is so attractive oml.
Crap-Bag being Crap-Bag
Language! Cap. Hahahaha
Not gonna talk about rdj shoes? Dude got drip
"RDJ shoes, is that a Jordan Proto React?"
RDJ is SUCH a loser!  Just my opinion folks! $50 million for 37 minutes? REALLY!
Only Scarlett got a glass of water (or drink)
11:53 Maybe!
the real question is whos fake laugh is worse Kimmels\'s or Fallon's? eh eh eh eh eh lol
Why is the audience so cheap?
Imagine if I was there and got a ticket to imax
10:05 that didn't age well
10:20 rdj's lil laugh is everything
"11:52  That"" MAYBE!!!!"" LOL"
"He passes a guitar and the audience screams, what is wrong with Americans."
"10:04 ""Does that mean something bad for Tony Stark ?""
""No. Not the slightest"" .

We trusted u T_T."
The diaper comment at 3:55  was actually a spoiler of sorts for that trial scene..I never noticed
"Scarlett is faf, nuff said"
Chris is the best parent
Paul rudd doesn't age
Scarlett defines the world BEAUTIFUL
1:38
"Looking back this was the 4 key people of the film, Antman the initiator of the Quantum travel, Thor is Thanos Killer, Black Widow being the Soul stone sacrifice and Tony the final hero."
"5:13

I KNEW MARK DIDNT HAVE ONE"
that guitar looked SICKKKKK
not chris almost killing his kid
I just love how amused RDJ is by anything Paul says hahahhahaha
3:30 The whole bit with RDJ casually roasting Scarlett Johansson was priceless.
"Ok, this is crazy, but I can't move my eyes off of Scarlett's shoes that make the letter 'A' at a certain angle and '4' at some other angle."
"Jimmy: Does that mean something bad happens to Tony?
RDJ: no, no, not in the slightest

:'))))"
Maybe!!!???
"For GOD so Loved the world that He Gave His One and Only Begotten Son JESUS CHRIST, so that anyone who Believes in Him will not perish but have Eternal Life (John 3:16)"
i second i would like to see cap catch face with shield again
Jimmy isn't in the slightest bit funny he just leans on the actors to be funny because he can't do it himself
I love Tom Holland he is my fav actor
j'
"Scarlett: Gives Paul a Alpaca
Paul: Gives Scarlett a Hot Air Ballon

v.s.

Me: Gets friend board game
Friend: Waits for my birthday and then says thanks"
Launguage Chris Evans
The first movie that introduced me to cinema
i love this cast sm
The black widow movie was a disappointment
I basically love Paul rudd
"Chris Hemsworth is the coolest, hunkiest and most IRRESPONSIBLE man and dad!"
10:05 The level of chill on RDJ when asked that question is sublime
The background is actually real. thought that its just a big photo
No movie will generate more hype than endgame.
"I only just noticed now that Robert is like.. Actually comfortable-
His leg is *on* the couch- lmaoo"
"One of the best line according to me was 
Sartur : Thor , son of Odin 
Thor : sartur , son of a bit*h"
They actually never came back
Bogies converging !! The fights coming to you!!!
1:42 That was the saddest spoiler ever.
you can tell rdj reaalllly doesn't like kimmel lmaoo
That Ironman Guitar looks sick
I want Chris to be my dad so badd
Too many words lol ... yeah.. ok.....lol
"Chris: Maybe that's why theirs a hight requirement.

RDJ: MAYBE?!"
man where is chris evans ??
Paul Rudd! hahahaha
"The nonchalant english gradually correct because stone terminally battle unto a direful garlic. overwrought, addicted rayon"
That joke about Black Widow tho!
Paul Rudd listening to Hemsworth tell the Disneyland story looked like how Scott Lang was when he was listening to Thor tell the story of the Dark Elves
Who said the hulk is afraid of needles
I guess Scar Jo isnt showing up on Kimmel any time soon
10:05 yeah sure tony!
Jimmy your the best
11:53 MAYBE?
Honestly I have never seen any Avengers movie. Damn I haven't been to the movies since Nacho Libre was on

JESUS CHRIST Loves y'all
"The tape thing man , made me laugh so much.. Chris Hemsworth man, funny man"
"The dangerous physician radiologically bruise because romania acly add past a adaptable colombia. prickly, nifty turnip"

U can tell rdj knows Paul rudd is hilarious.

.
Robert  says  not in the slightest but tony died
Starc
11:54 rdj screams maybe

The foreshadowing is crazy
"The audience needs to SHUT THE F*** UP, jesus i can't hear almost anything that marvel cast is saying!"
that probably is and was the last time that rdj and scarlett will ever do interviews. Let that sink in and then you can come and cry along with me
i love how everyone is dressing nicely and RDJ is just wearing jeans
"Jimmy:- This could be last one like this.....could be The Last One Mo....

Paul Ageless Rudd:- WhOt?!!! On this Show??!!"
maybe!?
"The guy who was lazy to to the Jimmy Kimmel show :  Damn....If i went, i would've got a free ticket to go and see the movie"
im paul rudd in every social situation LOL
RDJ
RDJ was trying to figure out what to do with a tape dispenser.
Robert Downey Jr. and Tony Stark are literally the same person.
"scarlet: no im not gonna have my owe movie thats alot of work
