PBS Arrival Airlines staytoon / hi 2023/
"Yeah, to bad, could have been HUGE! What happened?"
WHERE WOULD WE BE without PBS
Pilots are incredibly brave!
Why first officer looks like john cena
I'd love it if someone CGI an eagle in the cockpit.
Cool video we'll done thanks for posting it. Have a great day everyone
"HEY PBS WHY HAVE YOU TURNED OFF ALL COMMENTS ON EVERY ARTICLE THAT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH BIDEN??????? THATS SO WEIRD. ONE WOULD THINK YOU FOLKS AT PBS...PUBLIC BROADCASTING SYSTEM, FUNDED BY THE PUBLIC AS IN TAXPAYERS, WOULD WANT TO HEAR FROM TAXPAYERS.  GUESS NOT. I WONDER WHY"
They are very powerful
plot twist: this was just a fast procedure they just made it look dramatic
"Best explanation of how planes get off the ground. So simple anyone can understand.  I never understood what lifted the nose up, I thought it was just the speed. But the rotation info helped it all make sense. Thanks!"
I can't even parallel park................
"0:36 ""it starts with the aircraft building up speed.""
I thought planes took off by slowing down"
meh just a A380
World's biggest commercial planen and failure
ana lag hat tmm~~~~~~~~?
Love the A380 and the 747 together at 0:05.
Soy yo o veo a John Cena pilotando el A380
Model name?
i like planes.
who else didn't see the first officer i can't see him
WOW A380
bro i didnt know John Cena was a co-pilot
very nice
First officer John Cena
Wow wow wow wow
Hi
"Stop saying mph, say knots"
WOW mama
Love airplanes
Really?!?! A380 Weighs about 500 tons!? My home weighs about 670 tons!
When he took us thru the engine I felt like a bird about to die in that engine lol because it felt like a birds view when they fly into the engine
this was so beautiful
Flight 760?
The thumbnail is an game.-.
@captain joe
"Take off shown from various angles,wow,dat is indeed very beautiful!Suman"
This is fascinating indeed
"All I exclaim,WOW!Wot a sight,Lufthansa plane taking off in da sky is like a beautiful bird soaring high in da sky!Lovely,Fantastic!"
That's heavy bro!
This plane is from German and it was being magged by robbers in the late 1900 from East Africa
0:19 why does he look like skinny john cena? like john CENAAAAAAAAAA
John Cenas Hiden talent
2019 VIETNAM 00 08 008
"Love the title of the video CITY OF THE SKY!!!WOW,lovely,take off beautiful&smooth Appreciate the pilots skill/prowess2 take da plane in the sky so skillfully.explanation  well given.Suman"
First pilot is John Cena Lite
John cena in the house...wait u can't see him
"Lol they make it sounds so dramatic, but it's actually really chill."
PBS more like PBS kids
Mindblowing manifestation of the miracle of the creative mind of man.  As mankind is created in the image of The Creator.. this is clear evidence of it.
wow...
9:24 this guy's face is similar to John Cena
Educational
Lolll
Lllll
And I thought airbus beluga was the biggest lll
Tbh its a commercial plane
When you're a theater kids type  but end up in America television.
Who thought this plane is gonna crash
I heard captain john
How can someone dislike this
John Cena @0:35
White folks have achieved so much no need for insecurity at all in the form of racism
The runway looks like the one in fast and furious 6
1:54
One of the greatest machine master piece ever built by man.
Channel name PBS : me thinking of PBS KIDS
I'm a pilot. Faster speed faster take off. More lift
John Cena :O the First Officer :D
"I like to fly in that plane, that i my dream"
"I only wanted to see a takeoff, not an epic montage of something that these pilots probably do 10 times a week. 

Also, was that John Cena?"
"And now, they are in the scrapyard."
I just came to see if there's really that blue stuff coming from the airplane.. Disappointed
it is amazing
Is it just me or the co-pilot is a floating clothes
"The right thing, at the wrong time. Sad to see it discontinued in production."
Seems John Cena didn't went to gym for few months
"Ja Ja, Baba."
i like how theres another 747 with lusftansa
"This narrator is like ""if you take off you fly"""
I flew on the first Air France A380
Plot Twist: The thumbnail was taken from Infinite Flight :o
JOHN CENA!!!!
"And his name is 





John cena"
How nice
uhh cant yall just put an jato (jet assisted take-off) on an a380
What is the name background violin sound? 2:22
Air be like I am STRONG YEE
the first pilot is John Cena and the second is Christian Clay
bro they used infinite flight for the thumbnail
The Airbus A380 was the first successful two floor aircraft
Wow it's amazing take off
"Amazing engineering 
Wonders of its time"
"We are Evangelizing here today, Jesus Christ is the King of Glory and power, because everyone who believes in him and is baptized will be saved, seek his salvation, Jesus Christ is the way, the truth, and salvation, Christ said to be fishers of men and women for salvation, amen..."
Velocity 1 (V1) is not the take off speed. It is the speed after which aborting takeoff isn't safe due to insufficient stopping distance and therefore the speed after which the crew is committed for takeoff.
1 million pounds? I thought airplanes were lightweight?? How do you even make 1 million pounds fly??
Wow this is amazing to watching I had to play it over & over it gives me a motivational feeling I love it.
this is an overdramatisation of a plane takeoff
COMPRESSING IT UNTIL IT MIXES WITH JET FUEL AND IGNITES... like bruh ion care just show me the plane
Everyone is just gonna ignore this guy's awesome voice.
Subscribed. Amazing video
Is it A380?
Magnificent
Pilot is jon ceena
....
In the thumbnail it makes the plain look like it has chakra
Still find it crazy how something that weighs that much can be airborne. Aircrafts vlow me away. Always so fascinating to me.
Airplanes are so special and beautiful.
"How can you make something as simple as pushing the throttles, pulling back on the sidestick, and saying ""V1 - rotate""  so dramatic...."
Absolutely magnificent!!
Pass
Here's to hoping I'd get to experience an a380 in my lifetime.
This is like watching an anime!!
"Air Bus 380 may be a  biggest plane in the world but if you look at it from the front, it appears like Abnormally Grown Head  ! 
747 / 747-400 is uncomparable...
Most proportionate and Handsome  !"
AOC would cringe if she saw this video.
"Airbus a380: King of the sky
Boeing 747: Queen of the sky
(In my opinion)"
LETS GO CITY 1V1
3 years ago???? Why am I getting this now???
When did John Cena became a pilot?
I have nuff respect for pilots. That's not  a easy job...it  takes brains to fly that monster in the air under all different kinds of weather conditions and bring it back down.
"As what I thought of after seeing the thumbnail, there must be John Chena comments"
Cool video of plane :) 165mph V1
They missed the function of flap angle to help the talk off process and increase lift as well. :-)
Bruh dats amazing he single handedly flew that plane all by himself
Airplanes make a lot of CO2
"Thanks for this video. Keeping my dream to fly with A380 a live.
Covid put my dream in uncertainty"
"actually, it should not be rotation. rotation is for turning(or should i say rotating :) ) airplanes' nose on the horizontal plane(XY). The function of altitude gaining named elevation which is controlled by ""elevator"" or with another saying horizontal stabilizer(this is kinda weird but because it is horizontal). And rotation is controlled by the rudder/vertical stabilizer."
Airplanes will always be my most favorite creation mankind has ever made. Defying gravity.
When did John Cena became pilot?
What's hanging in the air behind the jet at about 2:45? It's vertically oriented.
The best plane I've ever flown.
Forget the science. I still marvel at how so much weight can stay up in the air.
They just turned  this take off scene to a mission impossible movie
A takeoff is not complicated. How did you even make it look like an emergency was happening or something?
Antonov: Am I a joke to you?
I had great experienced 2010 China southern Los Angeles to Guangzhou A380
3 years later its the worlds biggest piece of scrap metal
MY NAME SASSY!
"No matter how many times it has been explained to me, l still don't get how this amazing, huge and extremely heavy machines can fly.
To me is a total miracle and mistery of aeronautics."
"I like how the narrator is spewing bs like: gravity defying, saying the the pilot needa to get the plane up to a certain speed within the next 6 seconds (implying that this is something that is hard to do, when the machine is litterally made for doing it), and leaving the ground effortlessly after rotation.. wdym effortlessly? the plane requires an enormous amount of power to make that happen"
"I flew with 737,777 and 340...i really wanna try 380"
Drain the swamp make snowflakes cry
I can't see the first captain
Dramatic background-music close up pictures does not compensate for wrong explanations by a senore voice and even more faulty overlay graphics. What a nonsense
calm down people it's just a plane
"Small city, more a village."
"I just wanted to see a plane takeoff, not watch a thriller movie."
Fry butter
Beautiful!!
John cena taking entire crew to LA
Awesome!
Rotate
Lot of oxygen burnt up..thousands of jets every day. Had to say something that wasn't about John C...
500 tons
R.I.P. to the A380
I call BS it was not even about the 380 you could have said 747 or airbuss 350 this is a BS vid
Amazing technology. Thank you white people for all the great technology we have today.
Fascinating
I kind of don't like how this video makes it seem so hard
Is this made for 6 year olds? Like we know how wings and engines work...
Is that John Cena?
"What ""Hawg""!"
"2020: Where's the POC female pilot, Reeeeee."
Mind blowing
I like how the narrator makes something so normal seem so risky...
Where tf is the copilot?!?!?!?!
Its the AT-400 in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas
Watch wwe take to the skies & fight @ 30K feet in the cockpit for the wwe intercontinental pilot belt and a briefcase with $500K cash price hidden on the passenger area! watch John Cena take on 500+ passengers in a battle royale winner takes all in the fight of the century saga (Unchained Animals In A Plane) Live on the wwe  channel!
Finally I understand how an airplane flies
"A380: Manufatured 2007-2021
747: Manufactured 1969-2022"
We can see him
Why i get nervous for em lol
Way too dramatic
Deutche qualitat
"Dramaticalized and dumb. C'mon, PBS. You're supposed to be better than this!
And yes, Virginia, there IS a difference between knots and miles per hour.  V1 is ~160 KT, which is around 185mph."
Holy so dramatic
yo one of the pilots looks like john cena lol
"now i know what ""rotate"" means in an airplane; thx for explaining"
Is that John cena
HE PUSHES THE THROTTLE FOWARD NO WAY I DON'T BELIEVE IT SO DRAMATIC
I mean it is just an A380
Imagine people from the 1930s looking at these so confused
This is the 666 comment 0_0
Wait there is no co-pilot?
A38O is the BEST
During this video all the captain did was push the throttle and pull the stick...
Maravilloso el AIRBUS A 380 el mejor del mundo
wow the pilot is flying that thing by himself??? where is the co-pilot
Weird seeing a tiny John Cena
2 and a half years later the last A380 is built and proceeds to end its era.
A380 .. the newest white elephants
The Co-pilot kinda looks like a skinny John Cena
Why were there only 2 people in the cockpit?
V1 is the speed where it is no longer safe  to reject the takeoff. You are committed to taking it airborne.  Nothing to do with takeoff. The rotation call out is the speed in which tilt the nose up.
"Not much bigger than the jumbo, but main difference is everybody loves the jumbo."
why we hardly see the elevators rotate
"All news be like, airbus fails to make a aerodynamic plane"
So basically it pops a wheelie and starts flying
"When I saw the thumbnail,I thought the plane was on fire."
John cena
Magnificent plane. Flying palace.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BMp2WwMdPI
Why co pilot looks like slim John cena
Captain Joe and all the Flight Simulator pilots know its not a big deal but the narrator makes it sound so challenging lol
"Joe ???
On a German aircraft ???
Don't believe that for a second !"
The video makes it seem like something terribly wrong is going to happen.
165 MPH = 265 KMH
1:08 going into the engine  looks like something from fast and furious xd
I love it
The biggest passenger plane is the 747
"Top 10 funniest hack that will surprise you:
https://youtu.be/ooQPs99VJnA"
Wow
In 10 years this is going to look like a pebble compared to the new planes
the co pilot looks John cena lol
I love you #dasbhai
1:26 looks like john cena
I literally just flew in the a380 a couple hours ago
Wish we had Wright brothers alive to see all these.
Still never understand how plane flies. Now the technique (or the theory) but still could not wrap my mind around it to really understand how a steel cage weighted tons and tons of steel cpuld just lift off and fly like a bird.
Complacency
That captain looks like Lufthansa's chief A380 fleet pilot Joachim Schwarzenberg.
Is that John Cena as second pilot ?
"Title:

Antonov: am I a joke to you?"
ITS NOT MPH FOR PLANES ITS CALLED KNOTS
Thanks for the tutorial now I can fly.
Just want with them to Europe last year smooth flight
Why those the 1st officer look like John Cena?
i remember watching this when i was 7 like 5 times
The copilot looks like John cena
I want to see the Wright Brothers'  reaction if they see this video.
It best plane ever I have been it
G
"thank you for explaining what rotation can do, i didn't know"
"Guys go watch this while listening to: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7EqoT5YOqk


I kid you not, it is the most amazing thing ever. You will feel invincible. It works especially well if you use headphones.


And if you're ever on a real plane waiting to start taxiing, start jamming to this. It will make your plane's slow crawl across the asphalt seem like the most amazing thing ever."
the second pilot look's like john sena
Here comes cena.
"Lufthansa bagusnya di perbaharui cat pesawatnya cantik seperti warna KLM dan Korean Airline, warna biru agak cantik pesawatnya."
Never knew John Cena was a first officer pilot
I once wanted to be a pilot.this just  made my day ...thanks
Wow ! I knew planes could fly!!! But dang i loved the animation and attention to detail! Great job!
Nice vid
Beautiful commentary
I just love the look of A380 and Boing 747. They are just beautiful to look at.
Most ugliest liversy in the world.
This video was more informative than any hour long airplane  video I've seen
emirates a380 800 is the biggest
"Retiring too
Soon"
"165 miles per hour
TRIGGERED"
This is not the worlds biggest plane..the antanov mriya is. Thus is the worlds biggest passenger plane
Nice
Not the worlds biggest plane
Airbus A380
"For PB S that was very poorly done if that was a city in the sky it's certainly not a very big city In terms of its population a 747 100  Set the world record when it lifted off with more than double the population of that city in the sky, And as though that weren't enough it landed with 2 extra people on board as 2 babies had been born during the flight learn your statistics PB S."
Why can't I see the first officer?
Such a beautiful plane!
How come we struggle so much with waters and space explorations then when it's that easy?
Where is the first officer? I can't see him
Why does the co piolet look like John Cena
I love how the thumbnail is from a flight sim
Have they ever even seen Antonov an-225 ?
"Captain Joe:

PBS: *_ONE MOVE AND THE PLANE AND ITS PASSENGERS WILL BE CRUSHED BEYOND RECOGNITION_*"
Captain... Joe?
I don't wanna ruin everything but isn't antonov the biggest plane?
Ok.
"It does not defy gravity, it overcomss"
why u have to make this video so dramatic
747 IS BETTER
"First officer looks like John Cena, much leaner one."
Wooooooow .... how it was cool...really amaizing
I flew On this plane San Francisco to Munich its lovely inside
95% of flight is usually computer guided
It's not the world's biggest plane
Airbus Beluga has joined the chat

The narrator sounds like its the sexiest moments of his life
"*World biggest*

Adios A380. The idea is great the plane is unpractical.
"BIGGEST WHITE ELEPHANT,  a commercial failure as well."
i fly a lot and even this video makes my stomach QUEEZE
Y is john cena thin in this video
"Im just wondering why the name of the city I live in is written on the plane, given its not South African Airways 0:10"

*Beluga air has joined the chat*
WAIT CAPTAIN JOE THE GUY THAT TOLD US EVERY THING ABOUT AIRCRAFTS?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!!??!?also captain joe now flyis the classic 747 but for me the boeing 747 and the airbus a380 are the most iconic aircrafts they are th e best and coolest and biggest

"It is  the biggest padsagener plane.
The antonov-155 is the biggest one"
Correct world biggest passenger aircraft... can't you get ANYTHING RIGHT ? You are sounding like FNN.... FAKE HEADLINES.
0:06 What a clash!
"Boy, if the Wright Brothers were alive today. Or the guy from Brazil. Whomever conquered flight first. Yes, there's still arguments about that."
Nice. I like his voice
BELUGA AIRBUS IS BIGGER
"The way he was talking about  take off made me feel like something bad was going

Lufthansa make the best aircraft in Europe

Beautiful
The captain would be rich asf

Perfect narration!
Great..

"WOWWWWW!!! I never new airplanes needed to bring up there speed to fly!!! 
Worthless video is worthless"
Jooohhhn ceenaaaaaa!!
"45% of the comments: pilots and avgeeks spotting errors

That's why I consider aviation one of the most fantastic humankind achievements!
Wow the voice of the first commander was perfect. I love that.
"Wrong , you said plane ! 6 engine antonov is worlds biggest plane..."
Short and sweet
I can feel the bulk

It's the biggest passenger plane not the biggest plane
V1 is decision speed tho
"2:18 *dramatic music* AND ITS CALLED ROTATION!

Best plane I've been on for a 11 hour flight
Didn't know John Cena had two careers

Why do they make it so dramatic
Amazing marvel
"AIRBUS A380 ...I saw you DC-10 on the runway. HOWEVER, a new Sheriff is in town called the AIRBUS A380. That rotation lift and speed, I love it.  That speed is Exhilarating. My 68th birthday wish is to take a flight on an AIRBUS A380. Thank you Captain."

Who else noticed the thumbnail was if
Why not focusing on making better more comfort and safety planes rather that stupid no legroom planes ?!
"Who cares about the science, I just wanna see inside"
When bees fly.
"*WHOAH, TECHNOLOGY.*"
This is not a city in the sky
I was literally watching this documentary on my tv yesterday
Sky*
U mean a hotel in the skh
They make it look really dangerous to do and rare to see
John Cena became a pilot and soon we cant see him along with the plane
2:44 Airbus Hamburg !!!
"You totally fucked up in the title. It's the biggest passenger plane, not biggest plane of them all. It's Antonov 225."
"Its not the worlds biggest plsne
The antanov an225 is"
"What a truckload of cow manure. Big drama over nothing. Let's start with the tremendous amount of fuel all these aircraft use and replace it with burned oxygen and heated air, thousands of them flying here and there, including military aircraft worldwide and then we'll see a monstrous problem where no sheep has come up to their sense as yet on their mentality of traveling here and there, including stinking Bali and elsewhere on what each aircraft does to our planet because through ignorance and peer pressure from friends who brag that they just returned from, or going on a plane trip and so others follow. Meanwhile thousands of planes fly day and night, sucking precious oxygen and replacing it with cancer causing pollution and damaging the O-Zone, the layer above our Earth where it blocks harmful skin cancer causing UV rays, etc. And, with an ever increasing population explosion, the cutting down of oxygen producing forests for timber, housing, or make way for crop and beef for Macca, forests that themselves are also vanishing on their own because less trees means less shade or young seedlings and other plants (of medicinal value), you'd think that the remaining forests and sparse trees would catch up with producing oxygen for the billions of people and their oxygen hungry machines? Think hard and see what I mean when planes (including huge ships engines and all motorized vehicles) get bigger and bigger... do you think these fly or move on nothing? What will happen when oil/fuel runs out? How will all those who live far and away or sparsely in the open country live without a car to get around or trucks to deliver the goods for your stores, shops and so on? We are a greedy lot who couldn't careless on what we do as long as we gobble down all the resource there is without a care of tomorrow (and future) generations, sparing a drop of fuel for our future children, a mine of diamonds or other mineral for sons of our sons. We are blinded by all what we see and no longer know wtf we are doing to ourselves, the planet and all living things on it. Big and bigger, more and more, want and need means we are blindly eating away future generations riches. And no wonder."
Dream job
I don't like the exagerated dramatization
A-380 is the greatest passenger airliner ever made. no one can't beat that effort what Airbus done to put this giant in to the sky.....
It's hot air
lol pablo escobar threatened to bomb the lufthansa plane when they didnt let his wife and mom and kits into germany
I agree
The narrator sounded slightly condescending...
"The A380 is the largest comercial aircraft, the biggest is the Antonov An-225 Mriya"
why is this so dramatic?
city?..ehh more like a village
BITCH please the antonov an-225 eats this little plane alive.
how can this fatso fly?
Notice the Masonic pyramid hand sign in the backseat look like Donald Trump sitting in the backseat LOL. PS research jet fuel hoax.
why do they make it seem so dramatic lmao. also it's not exactly the biggest plane...
Biggest plane is the Antonov i think....
Isn't that how every airplane works? lmfao
The a380 is not the biggest plane in the world
John cena dun dun dun a
That's John Cena!!
i thought the plane was using ultra instinct in the thumbnail
"I didn't see John Cena in the cockpit.

P.S. You see what I did there ? ;)"
"""It's called rotation"""
"When they break it down like that, flight really is something to marvel at."
I travelled in the Lufthansa a380!
"If this is the A380, that plane has a carrying capacity of 868 passengers. A city's population is usually defined between 1,500 and 50,000 people. *_So false, the plane isn't a ""city in the sky""_* *Puts on sunglasses*"
"""Hey man what are you doing today?"" ""Just flying an airplane 1/10 of a kilometer!"""
mriya is the biggest plane
the fuck is it so dramatic lol? Flight is nothing new
that's not the world biggest plane. Antonov An-255 Mriya is waaaaaayyyyy bigger
Nice Energetic voice of the reporter!! Great video!!
"John Cena is now a pilot, great..."
"every time he needs to go to the bathroom, he knocks down the cockpit door with his foot and shouts ''it's John Cena!!''"
759
2018 Boeing 53 747150202024123 Ooooo 45 0
its crazy how gravity works
0:16 is that Atlanta's control Tower ?
They make this sound so freaking dramatic
Foundation increase seem around external narrative material my.
2:55 you said 'effortlessly leave the ground'. how can you come against the gravity without effort. No effort means no plane at this scenario.
Correction: World's biggest *commercial* plane.
Lufthansa bad service. Never again!
the place is now in the air.. its called..flying ;)
the A380 is not the biggest plane on the planet by far mate
In thrust we trust!
Lol the biggest plane is the antonov an225
That's not the biggest plane
What airport did this flight take off from? I am presuming a German Airport with all the Lufthansa's buildings.
"This is actually the worlds biggest passenger plane, the Antonov AN-225 is the true biggest plane in the world."
a380 isn't a biggest airplane. Antonov 225 is the biggest plane
"It's not the biggest plane, it's the biggest airliner."
was the john cena???
"0:05 Airbus  :  So long Boring ( Boeing ) .....
         Boeing :  So long Assbus ..."
this would be soo good in a physics class for an explanatory video
Did john cena became a pilot
they make it look so dramatic
John cena ??
this is not the biggest plane in the world. The Antonov 225 is the biggest plane.
Woooo amazing take offf
Beautiful explanation of plane takeoff mechanism.in very short time. Maashallah.
Biggest passenger plane*
John Cena in the cockpit?
Nice vedeo
The co-pilot looks like John Cena
Why would you make it so damn important plus it's not even the biggest plane and I fly on these all the damn time on Emirates
this is not the worlds biggest plane The worlds biggest Plane was made by the soviets the plane is called Antonov An-225
Those pilots are sexy as hell
Incorrect. Not the biggest. But nice try!
captain joe?
Sooooo cool PBS
Who has been in a380
"I saw a Lufthansa Md-11. 
Was it commercial or Cargo?"
"Wow, interesting video"
The A380 is the worlds lergest passenger plane
"The A-380 is truly a giant of the skies!  But NOT a giant to fly necessarily, with all the automatic systems now available in aircraft, there is rarely a need for basic ""hands and feet"" flying.  But unexpected incidents can occur, so one should polish their ""flying by the seat of the pants"": flying once in a while!  NASA has even proved that you can make an unmanned capsule that has been in space 200+ miles up, come back EXACTLY to a small target on earth and land!  Aviation today is quite remarkable."
Is the intro Infinte Flight?
Is't always 3 pilots on an a380?
Is this bound for Singapore?
this series would be a lot better if it wasn't sucking airbus' dick the whole time. Still enjoyable tho.
This video is so relaxing to watch
The turbine blades of a jet engine are employed after -- not before -- the air is compressed and ignited. How can PBS do a documentary about a jet airplane and get something this basic about a jet engine this wrong?
"*01:03** - ""They suck in huge amounts of air through their turbine blades compressing it before it mixes with jet fuel and ignites""* ==>

Year in, year out, decade in, decade out, those shitty TV programs continue throwing  disinformation our way. *Don't these guys have technical consultants??* I have yet to see an aviation TV show that doesn't say some form or another of BS, be it from Discovery, History, BBC, National Geographic, PBS or whoever.

FYI, turbine blades are NOT what compresses the air in a jet engine. Those would be the COMPRESSOR blades. Turbine blades are something else entirely. Please stop making and airing aviation programs if you cannot avoid messing up. You TV people have tried it for decades and never, ever managed to get it right.  Just give up already. LOL"
not what i was looking for but glad i saw
The First Officer has WWE celebrity wrestler John Cena like facial features.
This seems cool.
Oklahoma City Oklahoma USA
Wilbur would be amazed.
Poetry in motion !
where is the yoke? how is he flying it? lol
technological marvel indeed
"Wow, I mesmerized by how the planes  just lifts in the sky  as if gravity is just letting go."
