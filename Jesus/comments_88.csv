The guy actually have
Dude I can see all of the spikes coming off but you really have to go to the hospital so you can so I don't know so you can go to the hospital so you can get those out
A true catholic he loves to suffer
The ones on his back were like I'm stayin here
How you lick your blood ane the blood is durty and unclean
im pickle rick!!!!!!!!
yo after looking at all your videos well actually just the thumbnails i just end up asking one simple question. why?
Just the boys having fun!! Enjoy!!
ngl his screams in slo-mo sound like a lion
6:48
3:59 when you snort too much of it
I'm just like so that's why you always wear a hat
"4:53 
When you step on a lego"
That last voice he became bulk
he got wrecked
bro
cactus needles are worse than mechanical pricks. You'll notice after you've plucked them that they leave a light but large bruise on the skin. I'm guessing a chemical? pretty painful though
He sound like a cracking door 5:09
0:14 what is that
6 years later and still a masterpiece
"I've been ""attacked"" in the past by this teddy bear cactus and it's extremely painful!  These cactus can sometimes be mistakenly called 'Jumping Cholla"" because while laying on the ground, you can step on them and the spines act like a type of safety pin and they spring apart and fly in the air, landing on you.  They are barbed, meaning that once they sink in, they are very painful to pull out.  I've hiked with a common hair comb in the past as one of the ways to remove the cactus.  You get under the cactus, close to the skin then pull out.  The wounds bleed!"
"Coyote, what were you trying to get?"
"Man, a lotta ground to make up!"
This is why i don't like catcus
"5:10 - Awe man, what noise was that?! It sounded so cool...though not so cool for the person that made it...hehe."
3:30 bro got the cactus virus
HAHAHAHAHA
"You didn't come here because the video popped up, you came here because of nostalgic reasons."
Bro the weird noise I always do lol
Probably bro just wakes up and things have a terrible idea for a video and then just records it
How dos bro still live with all these things hurting him?
5:11 - 5:14 Bro sounded like a pop tube
I gat to on ly 1
Is that an animal?
It looks like he was shiting Demons
Atleast he has good knowledge and good pain tolerance
Sat. Jul 15 2023 anyone still watching this?
5:11 *xenomorph coyote*
"Call


I have gotten bit by a teddy bear cholla"
Lol he was trying so hard not to swear
Coyote is basically a vsauce variant
J
The fact that the worse thing he said while mark was taking out cacti of his skin was yoinks says a lot
That will hurt
"Bro they need to help him instead of just standing there, he probably is in so much pain!"
It feels like wax but more painful
My uncle gave me a multi tool that looks just like that one
"I feel so bad for him, like worlds painful pinches"
Mad respect for this dude not cry
I used to watch this guy a lot
Blud 0:22 was not careful
Yay now he doesn't have to force himself to do it for educational purposes-
"I lived in Arizona when I was four years old, I got attacked by the jumping cholla cactus. My mother made the mistake of trying to grab it and pull it off of me. We spent the rest of the day with her pulling needles out of both of us. This was in the sixties and I had never heard of this particular species before, though we had monster hairy spiders, scorpions, and Huge venomous lizards in the back yard, as well as rattlers, this was entirely educational and painful."
5:09 bro is a clicker
"""I fear no bug... But that thing! It scares me!"""
HOW IS HE NOT DEAD AFTER ALL THIS PAIN
You literally sound like a dinosaur screaming when he steps on one of his legos
"ok what benefit does the cactus get from this they mess with mammals and just strait up kill bugs but, WHY"
ihad to comeback to this man
He turned into a coyote 5:22
bro went wild 5:08
This guy needs his own tv show
Bruh.. I used to live in Arizona & I have had Jumping Cactus in between my toes. You know nothing of Jumping Cactus pain my friend. But thanks for the laughs and reliving the trauma LOL..
My man stays so calm when he does this im so amazed

"This is so funny to me. I hike in this area all the time in Tucson, it's like 20 mins from my apartment. Would've loved to see Coyote running around like a madman."
"Mario: How hurt do you wanna be




Coyote: Yes"
"This guy is the definition of pain tolerance, he got bitten and stung by so many bugs and a worm puked on him and pricked by cactus even drank cactus juice out of a sock"
Smokey jungle frog
The way he said hold on one sec I want to get stung by the tratula hawk like BOY
Imagine him stumbles while he goes to bring the tarantula hawk and fell inside the cactus next to him haha
Sukubek
"Oops, Mark just made a rookie mistake, he'd should of removed that cacti off of above Coyote's elbow first then removed the other off of his back, and now he has that cacti on his hand."
I dealed with those when I was five and it hurt really bad the mini cactus
This man is at the urge at screaming a curse word
He was just tryna catch a tarantula hawk..
That looks like that hrt I feel so bad for you
How did he keep it pg
"Coyote: AHHHHHHHH

Mark: What happend?
Go go go!"
I came here from tiktok

I was actually hiking not too far from there when I was seventeen when this took place. I was doing the same thing coyote was doing I was looking for animals and ironically about 10 minutes after I heard him scream I leaped into teddy bear cholla I caught the creature
This guy is the next Steve Irwin XD
This is why I'm afraid of spiky things
He velocorapter
Dang that looks painful
"In the middle of the desert, there stood a cactus. It was tall and proud, with sharp spikes covering its sides. The cactus had never known love, for it lived in a harsh, unforgiving environment where nothing could survive except the toughest of plants.

One day, a tiny seed landed at the base of the cactus. It was an aloe vera plant, small and delicate. The cactus was surprised to see it there, as it had never seen such a fragile plant survive in the desert before. But as time passed, the aloe vera grew and flourished, and the cactus began to take notice.

At first, the cactus was wary of the aloe vera, fearing that it might not be able to withstand the harsh environment that they both lived in. But the aloe vera proved to be strong and resilient, and the cactus was impressed by its resilience.

As the days passed, the cactus found itself drawn to the aloe vera. It admired the aloe vera's delicate beauty, and the way it seemed to glow in the desert sun. The cactus knew that it was not a conventionally attractive plant, with its sharp spikes and rough exterior, but it found itself falling in love with the aloe vera nonetheless.

The aloe vera was hesitant at first, not sure if it could trust the prickly cactus. But as they spent more time together, the aloe vera began to see the beauty beneath the cactus's rough exterior. They talked for hours, sharing stories of their lives in the desert and the challenges they had faced.

One day, as the sun was setting, the cactus mustered up the courage to tell the aloe vera how it felt. ""I know that I'm not the most attractive plant in the desert,"" the cactus said, ""but I want you to know that I have never felt this way before. I think I might be in love with you.""

The aloe vera was taken aback, but it felt the same way. They embraced, and in that moment, they knew that they were meant to be together. From that day on, the cactus and the aloe vera were inseparable, their love growing stronger with each passing day.

And so, in the middle of the harsh, unforgiving desert, two unlikely plants found love and happiness. They showed that even in the most difficult of environments, love can bloom and thrive."

Ethan
4:00
I miss these classic Coyote episodes! These is peak Coyote right here.
Can you imagine if the Tarantula Hawk got out of the net and stung him
"Seeing this 6 years later again, I have a little cactus plant, I've been spiked a decent amount, at first I thought he was overreacting a bit but man, my cactus plant is so little and the spikes too, and they hurt. They sting and burn, it's really gnarly. I can't even imagine that."
Sometimes I check your channel just to make sure your still alive
Are not going to talk about how brave mark was?!?!
I would have been swearing left and right like there was no tomorrow

Guy with cactus on him: explains all about cactus while in pain

Bruh"
"Last summer, this happened to me but it was one mere cactus instead of nearly 10 on Coyote. Props to him. I don't know how he handled that pain. I spent one hour carefully prying the spikes off me but this guy just rips the whole thing off."

But at least my dad took them out thank God
In my mouth
Bro that happened to me once when I was like 7 years old or 8 years old when I went to Mexico
Could you reply to me if you want to say he is ok? (Is anyone watching this in 2023?)
How did this dude do this without saying a single cuss word
"The cacti in the desert have left me feeling impressed and in awe. They survive and thrive in such a harsh environment, which makes me greatly admire their resilience.

I cannot help but be amazed by the images of the cacti in the desert. They come in different shapes, sizes, and colors, but all are beautiful and unique. The cactus stems rising from the ground look like the legs of ancient mythical creatures, and I am truly drawn to their beauty.

I am eager to learn more about these cacti and how to care for them in harsh environments such as the desert. I will share this video with my friends so that they too can appreciate the wonderful beauty of the cacti in the desert."
I bet it hurts more than a waxing stip

St john fisher
"I was riding my bike on a trail one time and as my foot swung back up from peddling, I snagged one of these on my shoe and it whipped up and stuck me allllll up the back of my leg. Bro, it's absolutely excruciating. I had to yank them out all alone. Worst one was behind my knee. One got stuck deep in my index finger, that was 15 years ago and there's still a lump. And he's right they're not just needles, the have hooks like harpoons."
That noise got me laughing lol

"I fell into a teddy bush once when I was a kid visiting my aunt. Getting stabbed hurts. Getting the cacti removed hurts like hell. I'm not saying Coyote isn't tough, I'm just saying he yelps more than I did after my auntie ran a fro comb down my back as fast as she could so it could be done and over with and her nephew wouldn't suffer. If you've ever seen ""O' Brother Where Art Thou?"" then you know the exact noise I made when she was done"

He should wear like gloves and a costum so not to get that much pain

"Runs down the hill*
AHHHHHH*
The cameraman man's* let's go!
After a minute they're getting this one thing off and he goes like it's like a bird when he goes aeeeeeeeeee lol it hurts so bad that he made that noise"
See that's why you don't mess around with those things or cactuses essay don't mess around with them
Went through all that just to be stung
Pain for entertainment. This guy insane but awesome to watch
imagine removing those then suddenly a few seconds after you get more cactus stuck to you
thats definitely more painful than a breakup
"5:11 and here we have the predator, and as you can hear, he is using his hunting call"
5:10
AWESOME VIDEO
I can feel the pain he is going through
"I love how he got spiked by at least twenty cacti, and then after removing them he had to go get stung by a wasp. The things this man goes through for our entertainment and education."

"As an Arizonan, I have gotten a cholla stuck in my arm before. I feel the same pain you do, Coyote."
"3:33 This scene Is like that Drawing saying
""You'll never understand my Pain, Hehe Sorry."""
I know this pain not that severe but I fell into a bush of prickly pears when I was in Arizona and they have thousands micro needles with barbed ends as well but watching this was funny and also painful to watch haha
Was the thing you cwtched worth it?

A level of pain that changes your voice into a cartoon character."

"you think chollya is bad, wait until you do the same with certain tropical  sea urchins,, their needles are also backward pointing barbs, and extremely brittle to infect you, because you cant get the barbs out unless you'd carve out some flesh"
2013 people be like: Do it for the vine!

Mother Nature can be cruel.
5:34 Ooooh Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Yyyyoinks

The barbs are so strong that it pulls the parts off the bush.  Even the very gentlest touch will stick in your skin.  Then trying to get it off makes it go into your other hand.  Horrible bush. Some people say they shoot needles.
right?
This Guy is a hero 1st hero!
Grim reaper watchhing.....
5:11
Why does he sound like a predator from the movie? 5:11
"I would've been that one friend that would've said ""Well in our defense we told you be careful and that's not what you did"" am I the only one?"
That man is not afraid of anything
"Coyote is the type of guy to put his life on the line, for the sake of our entertainment and education, He's one of those people who make YouTube great, I been watching this guy for years, and I've learned so much! I'm glad I found his channel that day I did"
Hornets or cactus?
Love how coyote is staying kid friendly
Hurt
Mario like seeing coyote hut because he smiles
"Hey Morons, maybe stop filming and help him. Oh wait, you are trying for this sort of sensationalism. OK let him bleed. who cares."
i wouldve just went into the car and took the jacket off
5:09 he was like an opening door
ow that must be pain
"Coyote made the grudge sound, he was in so much agony!"
His face
YOINKS!
In Oklahoma we have tarantula hawks
I really want to make a trip to this desert someday. It looks fascinating. But this video taught me that that cacti can be very dangerous.
