"Homelessness has now become the exploitive opportunity for a non profit syndicate of tax evaders
Drawing salaries benefits and the added public persona of doing selfless work on behalf of those in need
It seems nothing could be farther than the truth
The local homeless encampment in Sebastopol Sonoma County has not placed one single resident into housing
They represent themselves as a transitional non profit 
Helping the homeless go home 
What is going on ?
Alot of salaries drawn and  money spent to do what ?
At the risk of sounding both cliche and ignorant
When will this end ?
Susan Illich
Former Sebastopol resident
Housefire Victim"
Hey and actual Construction Company to build Apartments to the sky where all abaddon's people
The politicians in California are taking the money and putting it in their pockets
I knew it was California before even clicking
This is more like Escape from New York than real life.  Where's Snake Pliskin.    What's the answer.  Clean them up or make huge prisons.  In the mean time.   Follow the Money.   Attack the graft.  The only way these people are going to clean up is if they Have To.   Sad but true.
"The govt. wants them dead
Population reduction"
Blah blah..lets talk about something more important..you will never fix lazy or addiction with no re-education camp
You shouldn't be degrading the original sci-fi effect of the original Mad Max production out of Australia. It was truly mesmerizing and bizarre to see in person on the big screen.
Ummmm.. hey..get a FN job people..start at the bottom and work your way up. That's the way it works.. and you gota stop doing dope.
Should be called suicide island.
"Watched that "" Twisted Metal"" series last night...well, several shows over the years that refer to America's decline into chaos and anarchy..
Almost like it was one of them Biblical warnings hidden among the writings in Hollywood..""life imitating art?""
Seems not even all the money and power America has, the ""American Dream"" ends up becoming a nightmare for many..
And while the economy declines, buisnesses close down.."" they let more people in."" 
Don't have all the facts, figures..cannot assume all that is news these days to speak truth on the subject matter on the whole..
Lots going on and even in this age of information, one does not see or hear everything. 
Does not appear America is winning the war on anything, and is tearing itself apart while unknown entites profit from it's demise...war abroad and at home. 
But again, I do not live there..even if so, travel ability would be just as limited, same with information access...so all I see is stuff like this channel among others..
Some people look as if things could not be finer, and others..well..living in conditions like what is shown here.
Plenty of those better off in life speaking ill and looking down at those whom were thrust into such circumstance not by their choosing does not help matters either.. but "" here we are."" 
Malnutrition, lack of clean water..well, that does lead to mental health issues on its own  nevermind people waving guns in their faces and denying constitutional rights..
Some parts of america do look like a third world war zone on the news .. and growing in size. 
Future uncertian where I am at as well.."
Zero compassion from these elite buffoons...
Maybe if mayor's didn't live in upscale gated communities they might see the real life in cities they govern or if at least they drive through every street daily instead of sitting behind a desk all day sighing oppressing ordinances against tax payers.
120 million a year?? Get real no money has made it to the homeless.
Our government disgust's me.
"Democrats and US News Media (CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, NBC) are making all this possible, because they don't report on it, they don't hold liberal politicians accountable."
When the hell did mood and mind altering substances become exceptable
THAT IS BIDENOMICS IN OAKLAND
RESULTS OF VOTING DEMOCRAT
"Biden destroyed America
 never vote democrat"
Terrible!!!
"Now now children theres a huge piece pf the puzzle  missing  the democrats and republicans both have issues
That needs to be aired out amd a less radical democrats or less tadical republician because right now what you see is what us poor calif  citizens stuck in  the  middle with partys  that both are  funatical  both are bad for calif. Both are to blame for the
Fiesco  in norther valif  both are guility, what we need is moderation instead of all right or all lleft s dark place that we can emerge from iwere the political  will is for the best intetrest of all my fellow Californians if we dont end this stupid wayof thinking were  doomed."
Whoes fault is it? Most Americam citizens fault for letting this happen and not doing any thing to stop it! Don't give me the excuse your going to vote it away!!!
Joe Biden's disastrous build back america .
Dem city
The u s government pisses me off to no end
Just when I thought Harold had a brain he says the last sentence of piece. Racist too
Our country is falling apart
seems like standard procedure for democratic states
This is the democrats so called New world order. And Republicans go along with it.  Only Trump offers a solution to America's sheer Madness!! It's in Massachusetts big time...
"Looks like Anytown, Africa."
Make sure you get your 1400 montly check tho
"""Any drug you get atva pharmacy is safe"" wow"
This is a direct reflection of the US government's corruption all the way down city governments corruption. They are happy to watch their cities deteriorate into gang controlled ghettos.
Dystopia brought to you by Bidens Woke Democrats. And a short time ago mean tweets were the worst thing you had to worry about. Strange indeed
"Oakland, ca. if full of black criminals."
It is not a homeless crisis it is a drug crisis enabled by a progressive judicial system and progressive political system.
They did it right in utah and the bums left the area
In every 100% Democrat run city...
Just say it DEMOCRAT RUN  CITIES
Ths location was a clean gravel lot in 2021.
How about go after the fentanly and protect america and americans
Keep sending our tax $ overseas funding war!
Escape from LA movie
Your a zombie. Monster ghoul a fiend.
"As a homeless veteran living on fentanyl Island right where that fire was, I can verify that the city waste even more money then 128 million dollars every year and there is literally nothing to show for it!! Accept the fact that they hand out free needles, free bubbles, free crack pipes everything you'll need to never stop doing drugs!! If by some chance the city does get you housing it only lasts 6 months before the funding runs out and you're back to being homeless again!!! It's a never-ending revolving door"
"0:00 already putting a bad taste in my mouth with this one fox. I don't see how any of this is funny. This is a complete travesty and we should all be hanging our heads in embarrassment knowing our country and the people within are in this sort of despicable state of being. and doing all that we can as a community to help people with mental issues, that lead them down this path of despair and destruction in the first place. Instead we're laughing and joking around. Smh ridiculous."
Welcome to the Apocalypse Squidward.  I hope you like leather.
From these pictures I'm listening and seeing what the hell happened are these sites. Did they go in a bottom or what what the hell's going I mean humanity humanity sucks right now
Y'all need to stop blaming it the saying that all homeless people that have lost everything through the pandemic in the outrageous cost to live in our drug addicts because there's millions of people that are not drug addicts that are losing everything they have is what your governments are doing
7:04 Do that with the racists also? sure! let's start with Joe Biden and Barak and Michelle Obama!
"Land of the free. We, the rest of the world, will warm ourselves with the embers of your dying country."
"THE LEADERS , OF THESE AMERICAN RUN DOWN DEMOCRATE CITY'S, SHOULD BE ARRESTED FOR DERELICTION OF DUTY AND CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY FOR NOT ENFORCING LAWS ON THE BOOKS AND , NOT  PROTECTING THE LAW ABIDDING TAX PAYERS CITIZENS OF THEIR CITY ! 

AMERICAN'S , TAKE YOUR CITY'S BACK NOW !"
We obviously just need more liberal policies like California
Lock up the politicians in mayors in sanctuary cities
I wish all you young kids could remember what California used to be back in the 70s
Thanks democrats
6:00 - Gutfeld beginning his turn to work for CNN. Advocating for legalization of drugs!  That is absolutely not the solution. Look how many people started trying marijuana when they legalized it. You're adding thirty percent more people that would not have even thought about it!  This is why I don't watch Fox after Tucker left.
Escape from Fentanyl Island
"Or.....we have this place called jail. It works good too.  It's separate from society, has rules and is its own entity. Going strong since 1776 and guess what, it works. You even save people's lives cause they don't usually get drugs if you have good personal running it.  Send me 120 million. I'll get you fixed up. Hell, we could probably do it for half that."
"The housing crisis has become a massive issue in America. People with decent jobs are unable to afford housing, and those who were already down and out have little chance of survival. Then we poured the migrant crisis on top of the fire and have created a situation that is turning America into a second-world nation. Not so coincidentally, most of the homeless population lives in blue cities."
I was in Oakland for work. Drove out there from Georgia. Got a room at a hotel that had a Fence around the parking lot and a gate. Still woke up and my tools were missing and they had drilled my ignition Switch out trying to steal my truck. I told the customer i want be coming back to Oakland.
I saw all this happening from the beginning in LA starting years ago.
Lock em up I rather pay for them behind bars then pay for them to live on the streets
Moab
I love to see a Democrat complain about what they voted for.
Isn't this city run by democrats?
Who in the government is responsible or accountable for this? Why are they not fired or impeached out of office? Are they haters of the welfare of USA nation?
AND THEN THEY WONDER WHY YOUNG PEOPLE DONT WANT TO WORK AND PAY TAXES
"Let me guess, within another Unconstitutional  Sanctuary states/cities, that was created to Harbor Illegal aliens, which has brought in criminals, rapists, drugs, waste, etc. When will this lawless, Unconstitutional set up EVER be stopped and shut down and begin to follow the laws under the Constitution?"
"Bidenomics at work!!! They actually don't lock up fentynal dealers anymore.if that doesn't surprise you,then the human traffickers,thieves,zombies,and the mentally ill might just get your attention."
I see NO PROBLEM AT ALL!  Californians VOTE FOR THIS YEAR AFTER YEAR! So you GET WHAT YOU VOTE FOR! Now fuc...you people live with what you voted for!
America doesn't have a homeless crisis. These worthless people caused their own problems. They are responsible for themselves. We taxpayers are NOT responsible for this mess. Survival of the fittest is how it should work.
Hmmmm looks like Bagdad after shock an awe
"Non profits please 
No such thing in America"
I know lets make DRUGS AND PAY people not to work  and vote DEM and things will be GREAT
"If you still live in California or any blue state, you have forfeited your right to complain."
It's definitely drugs and immorality not covid lockdowns and a recession once or twice per decade
This is coming to every State as long as them evil Demonrats are in charge. America is done.
Could you even imagine Gavin Newsom as President. He would turn America into California. That's scary.
"We need an Island like in the movie ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK! They put criminals, druggies, pedos on Manhatten Island, it was their prison!"
"They want the people to move and the street people to die. 
THEY WANT CALIFORNIA TO BE A CESSPOOL SO THEY CAN BUY IT ALL UP AND BUILD IT LIKE THEY WANT.  CORPORATE CALIFORNIA."
"This crime spree is on purpose, these piece of craps in government want Marshall law. By letting criminals go crazy the people in government are waiting for society to beg the government to come in and save the day."
"Man how do these city officials keep their jobs? Where is the accountability? If jobs are on the line, people will get fired things will change real quick."
The government is taxing the average working person and business so excessively it's hard for many to survive. The government solution is to increase taxes on the people barley hanging on to fund homeless programs that are mismanaged so at the end of the day their solution is most likely creating more homeless. I think the drug problem is fueled by the immense pressure of trying to survive. If a person is financially secure and not in a constant state of worry I would think they would be less likely to turn to drugs for a temporary escape.
Homelessness is a great money laundering scheme just like Ukraine.
"Disgusting what libs and drugs are doing to our country. Fentanyl Island,  Slab City ,  and skid row are now a normal thing to see. Give out free needles and Crack pipes. Legalize 99% of drugs. Shitting in the streets and the sidewalk shows how much they hate our country."
"My solution would be to hold lying doctors and pharmacuetical companies criminally responsible for the people that they murdered and the lives they ruined. First we go for the head of the snake. Until people stop making money off poisoning people with no consequences, this will keep getting worse."
"You know there are enough millionaires in this country that no one should be homeless. If they only gave a small percentage of the vast amount of income they've gotten from this country back to the country it would be a great country again. As rich as America is I cannot believe that we allow poverty like we continue to do so. 
# Billionaires pay your share"
"Ooh I know how to stop it, start a war, and an energy crisis, maybe a pandemic or two then make the billionaires even richer."
Good job voting Dems. Good job.
This is a legit way of killing people it is sad
This is sad
"AND THE LEFTOVERS WANT GAVIN NEWSH*' FOR OUR NEXT PRESIDENT, THAT TELLS YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW!, THE LEFTOVERS ARE FOR SATAN!, PERIOD."
Bidenomics is working well. Please send more money to other countries
"No used needles in the mad max movie, specially the first movie."
"Winter is coming...department stores along 5th avenue  will be vandalized and expensive bougie clothes  will be utilized to keep warm...as well as the stires will be filled with migrants squatters who cant be evicted... ""The Purge"" is coming..."
depopulating the world one lost soul at a time. repent and turn to Jesus.
"YOU CAN'T START CREATING CRIME TOWNS.  ARE YOU INSANE?  ALSO, ALLOWING RAMPANT ADDICTION IS AN OPEN DOOR TO TOTALITARIANISM.   HAVEN'T YOU LEARNED ANYTHING FROM HISTORY?"
"""We ought to do that with the racists too"".
I agree. Starting with you Harold."
Ur right. Woke ruined everything.
Looks worse than Afghanistan
"If you start segregating drug addicts, soon what will happen with no positive results. People will say why are we keeping them alive? Of course, what is the other alternative?"
Result of dumb-downing your population.
Nope..That is much worse than mad max!
"Vancouver BC, free needles and a government vending machine in the poorest area that sells fentanyl and meth. Socialism is the problem here. Your constitutional republic has been infected through democracy with a  disease called socialism and the next stop slavery. Thats why ukraine gets the money and the tax payers get the shaft."
This is real America. The main stream media under these criminal Democrats and Biden doesn't want the world to see and its gonna get far worse.
All paid for by marxist groups. Total destruction or bust
"A country without God at the forefront is a country gone under...bottom line. 

What's even sader, is our men are doing nothing about it! 
Too Self absorbed and lazy."
California voted for this.  It's on the voters.
Government causes this deliberately. It's easy to rule poor people.
Democrat voters are not only stupid but highly dangerous to normal people m
Coming to the house next to you
this is china destroying us  they produce this drugs
I can't understand why Mexicans want to come to the usa so bad.  Embarrassing!!
Keep voting Democrat as our city slides into a violent hellscape!
"Sadly, Oakland was a shite hole 50 years ago.  How it continually gets worse can only be blamed on liberal lunitics who control Kalafornia!"
"Whay cleaning Americans city if you can go to other countries and bomb theme for the same price, and still pretend that you are good human being."
5:20 or so....District 9
"The solution is: you are caught on the street with fentanyl - you go to the island for a year, but there should be no drugs there."
America is in decline!
I just can't believe they have nothing to show for 120M a year. Fox is making this up!!!
"Recently, a story announced Gavin Newsom was giving crack pipes to homeless"
America is turning into Cuba.
Didn't the original movie Mad Max take place in 2024?  Sounds like we have only a few months to go.
lmao that one dude couldn't help but bring up races! LOL
"The drug is made in China, their are bodies everywhere.
And even the news is saying they should put them on a island?"
"What in Hell are we looking at.
Gavin Newsom wants to run for president?
What are the radical left trying to do to our nation?
God will judge all."
"10,000 is a LOT of homeless people in a city with only about half a million residents"
What scares me is the drug Flaka.
"The last idiotic response deserves a rebuke: Replace ""racists"" with ""leftists"".  (You will of course need a lot more space.)"
We all know the politicians steal all the money.
The Democrats created this across many cities they control.
"I really wish people would stop using terms like ""gaslighting"". Ad Hominem. Strawman fallacy. Etc. These words have a definition. But those definitions have nothing to do with how people use them."
"Yeah, let's send all our money to Ukraine and all the other parasite countries instead of taking care of our own...Why are they doing drugs? Because they want to escape a miserable life they feel powerless to change..But they are just worthless scum right? Our brother and sister citizens in this state is a absolute DISCRACE..Don't count on the so called Christians to help them. ( the ones that pay ZERO taxes yet have all this political sway)..Let them help themselves, right? It's their fault ,right? Do you think Ukraine will have our back when the dollar finally dies our whole country is going to look like that..We don't need a Trump..WE NEED AN EISENHOWER"
FENTANYL ISLAND THANK YOU PELOSI AND NEWSOM ITS JUST WHAT YOU ASKED FOR.FJB
"Wow, what a dump, it's hard to believe that people live there."
"Gavin Newsom is the Governor, blame it on him for not doing anything"
Preposterous trying to say video supports lynching. It's a picturesque building near Nashville to represent law and civilization.
Governor Nuisance and Oakland has recommended residents carry Airhorns for protection. This looks WORSE than the Movie Escape from NY. Yep Zombie Apocalypse.  Remember this is where VP Kamala Harris came from & is her Track Record remnants.
"I see the democratic agenda of allowing the Republicans to take the next election, and saying ""let's see YOU straighten this out""!   They are setting America up for marshal law, socialism, or take-over."
Where is Gavin Newsom?
The solution to the homeless is simple.  Fly them out to sea and push them out. Never to be seen again.
Tsk! Tsk! Tsk!
The problem is that they need educate train. These people get him a job and then make them go to their job every day and be accountable. Put some discipline on them and restrictions and set up boundaries for them parameters
What we do?? Vote conservative!
"its not the governors fault, its not the mayors fault, its not the presidents fault, it's MENS fault. Women were given full voting rights in the 1960s and now its just time to pay the piper.  Men are the backbone of civilization and when you deincentivize men from being men, this is what you get."
Reminds me of the old Kurt Russel movie Escape From New York
"Stop voting for people that absolutely don't care about anyone but themselves. That would be the first step then working on making things affordable, including housing and real estate.. Things are getting out of control and we need to stop the bleeding."
Democrat sponsored communities.
Send Troops in.  Trump would do it.
Hide them all so we can't see them and let them die in agony...... Is that really what is being said??... Ffs these are fu****g idiots!
This is what happens when u r soft on illegal immigration
"And, they actually want Gavin Newsom for president!Aaaaugh..."
And there's more to come. Blue Tarp States
"Males on way to suicide, possibly due to feminism destroying manhood. The feminisation of males is absolutely abhorrent. We can blame feminism, government school indoctrination
It the woke agenda & policies that have brought the US to the brink of distruction.
Well done extremist left wing saboteurs!"
Why not just build a nice 15 foot wall around Fentanyl island and let them do whatever they want in there.
"This is Blinkered Biden, the Democrats bith Federally & the extremist left wing ""Sanctuary Cities""
America has become a worldwide disgrace for this and so many other reason's  over the last 2 years 6 months!"
Holeee sheet!
"I learned about what ""non profit"" means a few years ago.  I was volunteering for an organization that made donations to other non profits each month.  These two young women came to pitch their charity.  If became clear that some woman (their boss) started ""non profits"" for a living.  She hired fresh out of school young people to run them and the money that was collected simply went to pay the low salaries for the idealistic young  people and the rest went to her.   This particular non profit was for disabled children.  The primary event was a summer camp.  It wasn't too hard to figure out where the money went.  All the ""equipment"" needed was one time purchases, the participants had to pay to attend and all of the workers at the camp were volunteers."
That local activist looks like somebody from The Hunger Games.
"Unless you've been in that situation it's hard for people to understand it. I've been homeless most my life I've only had a home for the last four years,I'm 46, it took me almost 40 years to find a home. For some people it's just not easy. But it's easy for people with money to sit up in their office and judge people"
"To oppose Chinese government bullying! Next, I will take practical actions in Xi'an, China and shout for the people to speak up and serve them! I hope more people can stand up! Come with me and shout for the people! let's together Change this unfair world!"
All the Youtuber  van lifers and people living out of their cars and taking pride in it  reminds me of MadMax. It is so bizarre.
Patriots it's time for action and declare WAR against the evil democrats and take our country back STOP ALL the Bullshi+.........
Addicts tend to be absolutley terrible people. The exception doesnt change that.  Mentally ill people can be violent. Hopefully you can defend yourself. Calling the police will get you arrested. Its better odd trying to get away
Say what you will about their overall moral and ethical standards but the Nazis has massively effective answers for these problems.
"In all the homeless shelters and donations to schools on the reservations, it all goes to one or two people at the top .....never given to the homeless or native Americans like it was suppose to.....alot of embellishment."
"As long as you don't have to see the people or deal with them it's ok.
That's nice"
I used to work in Oakland many years ago.  My husband also worked in Oakland and is a civil engineer who negotiates public works projects with politicians.  Corruption in California government is rampant. We moved in 2012.  He goes back occasionally to bid a few projects.  He told me about a $509 million dollar project adjustment in Beverly Hills light rail project.  This was above the original estimate.  I think they were fighting for the protection of an endangered field mouse.
Arizona a joke like that too!
"Nothing will be done with this current administration in office, what a shame..."
Rent has doubled and tripled in some cases.   Working people are living in their cars.  So many jobs are out sourced out of our country.
My daughter lives In Oakland and has never said one word about 10 thousand homeless or fires or anything you are talking about??? She loves it there!!
What's funny...
Looks like there trying to burn and make the railway useless
getting what they voted for
Nancy is GAVINS AUNT
"GAVIN FOR PRESIDENT . PROOF 
IN PUDDING"
"$120 million a year for the last 5 years has gone directly into the Democrat pockets.  The same as it always has.  For that kind of money, they could house all of the 10,000 homeless.  I want to see those legislators jailed.  We have no justice in this country.  No one is held accountable and that is why this continues.  If the mainstream Media, including FOX, were NOT controlled by Blackrock or the CIA, and if they too were held accountable for LYING TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, this would never have gotten this bad.
I'm not even interested in what these costumed, makeup covered, talking heads have to say.  Charming wit doesn't cut it anymore.  YOU ARE ALL PART OF THE PROBLEM.!!  Pretend to care, poetically complain about how bad it is, take your multi-million salaries, go home and forget about it."
"Oakland versus Kensington in Philly, a race to the bottom for worst drug investested hell hole.  Gee I wonder which political party is to blame?"
This is an enditement on the mayor and politicians who have dropped the ball or arnt even in the game.
Ha. Buddy that ain't nothin. Just come to Portland and drive down 33rd. Ave between Columbia Blvd. and Marine Drive. Mad Max? Thunderdome is more like it. It's truly unbeleivable.
That is a democrat utopia.
Send another 25 BILLION to Ukraine.
DEMO-Rats in action!
It would wonderful if California would just fall off into the ocean and be gone!
"GAVIN NEWSOME's favorite movies were Escape From NY and Escape from LA. Don't we get it? HE IS AN ANARCHIST! Obviously! Wake up CA, we are circling the drain."
"But you know they did it, just like they go around threatening people and nothing happens. Someone makes a threat against them and they shoe up and out the person."
We need to do tours of apocalypse island. Take vacation there to see misery.
Homelessness is big business. No one in that business wants it to stop.
"It isn't a 'homelessness crisis', it's a drug addiction crisis. Are we supposed to believe these people would be fine if they had homes? They would continue with their filthy drug and other filthy pursuits."
"Oh they're laundering that money overseas where it's kept for 10yrs,  where no one knows who's that money is! And when they remove it 10yrs no one remembers where that money came from!!! Oh! We saw how it works! When the Panama papers came out!!! Puti and Fidel were some of the people who had billions there allegedly and some Americans and leaders from other countries. It's very hard to trace the laundered money because the person doesn't go personally, they have a number, no names etc. And it used to be in Switzerland,  now it's all over the world. Caiman, Bermuda,  Singapore is a laundering paradise etc."
They send Billions to Ukraine while our country looks like this.
Jesse the man the new legend is born great jod bud and the rest of you guys are truly amazing
"So you dump cheap drugs on us and demonize the people after the government destroyed the middle class and economy so they could put us in a factory working to make the greedy corporate criminals more money.  

Leave those homeless people alone and stop spinning your stories to make them look like criminals."
Left dreamed world: Chaos
"Oh! But who were the conspiracy theorists? It was the left! With the Russia collusion hoax! All the alleged theories about the lefts corruption,  turned out to be true!!! Who'd have thunk it? Huhh?"
Welcome to joe bidens America. You get what you vote for.
Fentanyl island
stealing taxpayer money.
CAUSED BY LIBERALS AND FAKE NEWS LIKE FOX
You can find this all over the desert here in Mojave deserts
"These illegal aliens,  not immigrants,  they didn't come here legally by the immigration process! You made them leave their countries to come live on the streets or to be kicked out wherever they go? You had to do what Trump had said! Stop immigration and deal with those already here and the homeless on the streets! You had to integrate those already here, teach then English, citizenship classes, have a job for them and help them find a place to live.not bring them in then say there's no funds! They brought them in to vote for the left and turn red states blue  and who knows what else."
"The state, local and national government should really be on top of this crisis with proper intervention instead of worrying about pronouns, woke politics and other bs."
It looks like the Idiocracy movie set!  The movie is coming true!  Soon we will have gatorade coming out instead of water at water fountains!
You have to hold people accountable for themselves!! Vagrancy used to be a crime.
"this is tragic and the sad thing is youre right its the fault of the government for eliminating the possibility to work and live...people turn to drugs and alcohol because they have feelings of inadequacy, give people a path to success and just watch how things change...eliminate self check out control inflation and the country will improve...create jobs and give people a functional economy and we will all grow together."
And just think the politicians that run these slums are also environmental nazis who blame middle class middle Americans for pollution.
Fuk FAUX Snooze!
Always remember that most of the Democratic politicians in Washington DC consider California a model that should be followed by the rest of the USA. Just ask them.
Jesus Christ
Stop Supporting Blacklives Matter a White Thing
": Multiple Late Night 737 flights dodging airspace and flight following, landing overweight illegaly on small airport runways at 200am with loads of kids in the dark , meeting parked vans discretely positioned like narcotics operators . It time for Hammer, Bags & Gags!"
I feel bad for the residents who had bought their houses years ago and now their houses are worthless when they want to move.
Yall just stoke the propoganda fires its laughable how sold out fox is now.
"Its everywhere -
When I was in my 20's we were forced into treatment or got locked up..
If you weren't taking care of yourself and were a threat to others.. you were pit away"
Ppl are dying cause fentanyl is ending up in all street drugs killing teens who are trying these hollywood glorified drugs. Every 30 seconds someone dies from Fent. Laced drugs.
I mean all those who voted dem Efffd around and found out. The thing about that crazy drug your talking about  that China sells to Mexico and Cartels bring into america and then it ends up in your teens coke or daughters meth.
Such bullsh*t
"now we must acknowledge this is for all of us once society breaksdown.Why? because youve been fooled to depend on technology. This occurs at every level, whether the technology is limited or advanced. UFOs that crash don't have survivors pulling out teleporters and time bubbles , they go on foot. It's obvious that when technology fails we are left blind deaf and dumb. Because we don't really understand it ,we make it a convenience. We emulate what was taught all over the universe , a dependence on technology."
Why isnt the solution going after all the corruption you keep talking about?
"Ok, it's time for some truth. You gave like 2 seconds of it and then breezed on by.
These ""non-profits"" are almost all crooked. Oh, they might do a thing or two there and there to make it look good. And shelters are DANGEROUS and there is a SEROUS issue with what you can catch just walking in there. They DO NOT do 95% of what they are supposed to do. And a huge amount of money and donations go right out the back door. NOT to those who need this. I was on both side of the desk and can say this because I saw it, and in more than one location. The people, by time they get connected to a shelter or case worker, are already massively traumatized. What happens to them via this system just breaks them. If they aren't on drugs already, it's a real concern what will become of them.
And please understand, statistically, most of those enduring under Homelessness Crisis.... because THAT IS WHAT IT IS....are not criminals. They are elder or aged out of the work place, medically unable, crime or domestic violence victims, or veterans.
And NO ONE ""GETS PAID TO LIVE ON THE STREETS"". That is so wrong, and you need to correct your statement.
And you take there people and they get dumped amidst the ones who are criminals or Dark Triad predators, what do you think will happen? Are you at all familiar with what some refer to as ""jailhouse mentality""? 
Now, understand me before you jump to conclusions: there is much going on out there that I do NOT say is ok, not at all. 
But if you are going to represent as professionals in the news industry, then TELL THE WHOLE STORY.
This issue in fact breaks up along two lines: those who are flat out criminals or who are Dark Triad personalities, and they refer to themselves as ""streets people"". But these people actually may or may not actually have a place to live and just want to run around out there and muck things up.

And then there are those who genuinely are in crisis, most who did not do so much wrong but are really a mix of unfortunate and victims of a very corrupt government actually (especially the vets and those disabled). This issue needs each person properly assessed and treated accordingly.

What you are looking at is the SIDE EFFECT of things that have not been brought out. Shame on our government and on professionals who do not report what's really going on.
I'll bet this will be just shined on and pushed aside. 

Sad. I remember when journalists took something like this, investigated, and really did a story....."
Why do Americans continue to Vote Democrat in Local & Federal Elections?
"Get rid of NGOs. No one should be outside the law claiming they only want to help. Leaders should depend on votes. No one should be able to tell others what to do without getting their vote. You circumvent the laws, you create unaccountability, you get chaos. The mayor of this dump could not outsource their responsibility if there were no NGOs to turn to. Non governmental organizations are the most cancerous idea ever conceived IMO."
"Disgusting!  It's the sign of the times, open up your eyes and wake up people!"
"Well, well. Why not do the whole Job. See below. 
Government = enabler for use of drugs 
Government = drug dealer.(state provided drugs) This way you can ensure clean drugs are getting used and you remove the cartels in one shot."
"put them in the island, it is a good idea. i had said it long time ago."
All that money... Why is there trash? Especially at such a degree. Why aren't any efforts made for trash pick up? Why allow it to build up? When situations like this happen it's displayed to represent EVERY SINGLE PERSON who lives outside. Instead of only blaming and dehumanizing people outside why aren't the politicians being held accountable for masterfully creating this mess? There's always something that's been designed to cause chaos. Human nature is weak and easily manipulated
Republican rule does it again...oppa...sorry. Make that Democrats messed up as usual.

"Don't worry this is the future of progressive USA, ppl only talk about the problem but don't do any help, long ago I said the humanitarian help was nothing else but the cover up for democrats democracy so they can start walking away with their pockets full while ppl loose everything as they said ""you'll have nothing and you'll be happy"" stupid ppl never opened their eyes, if democrats aren't totally removed you can kiss good bye your country"
Yes we do have a problem and it's not what the drug addicts it's with the sober f****** politicians governors that are running these cities so please spare us the b*******

Thanks Governor nuisance
they aren't going to change it because it makes them to much money plus the population control plays right into it also.. this is awful and the one thing we all forget they are souls
At least you know what the problem is with people on drugs. Nobody really can put their finger on the issue with the politicians
"The problem is the money never gets where it is supposed to because 25% for the mayor 10% for the ""big guy"" whoever that is at the time. 20% here 15% there 5% for this 8% for that 2% for payroll.
Oh darn! Not enough to do what we wanted... Oh well, let them eat cake!"
"One problem is ""reporters"" are complete morons.  So,  the majority of voters left, right, or center,  have no real information."

This is what u get when you let this happen
We can end this by ending the mayors job obviously
Way worse then mad max
Ok.... Well then... who is going to man up and sell machineguns and explosives.
Absolutely agree! This crap needs to stop
Oakland has allows been a violent crime center forever.   Why is anyone surprised?  It's practically a suburb of San Francisco LOL
Millions of Californians are deniers of whats happening.
"The word ""crisis"" is being used fraudulently.  None of this just happened out of the blue, or was caused by nature.     What we see is ""Intentionally orchestrated chaos and destruction"".   That is a more accurate term.  ."
All by design people..
"Oakland voted for their governor and mayor.  So, they must've liked this. Dead bodies are there,  probably of druggies...not a big loss..."
Utopia
solution:  send in a bunch of very poor homeless people from South of the Border (what used to be the border).
The blonde woman should stop doing journalism and do onlyfans or something.
Its a mental crisis. California has the best weather for this as well.
Anyone have a solution? Anyone?
This dialogue is crazy they are talkin some crazy stuff... Jesse is the only one making sense... It's another mayor or Governor socialist.
The cartels own the politicians.
Replace with Trump Care
Get rid of Demoncrates get rid of problem
Keep voting democrat! The only thing to do now is let the cities burn to the ground then start over!
They are hoping that they remove themselves permanently
What the hey
To much corruption and evil people  that are killing humans beings  with these toxic drugs...from politicians to drug pushers and the cartels from the world.
"Newsom has that slick wise guy face that REEKS OF CORRUPTION.  He and politics equals drugs, poverty, homelessness and despair.  How could any human 
being with compassion ever want him in office ?"
The democrat utopia you voted for.
Gutfield has it spot on here.
"I say they have just given up on these people.  They provided a place to park their souls, they've legalized their drugs so the cops don't have to intervene.  Then stick them in their spot and let them live the rest of their miserable lives.  They get free cremation too!  Keep it all behind that fence and it will eventually take care of itself!  Yeah...the devil is alive and thriving in Oakland, CA!"
"I used to have to drive with my children through Oakland to take them to the Military base to the hospital. I was afraid then, 40 years ago, thank God I'm not there now!"
Its all about a money grab and nothing is done but useless talk.
Climate change is FAKE. The ocean temps ARE NOT rising. The Heat index was hottest in 1930. It's all about control.

Unfreaknbelievable!! Don't know where money went? Check the pockets or bank accounts who applied for this crap!
"I have an urgent, surgery, doctor's appointment at the hospital in Oakland and I don't want to go !!!"
"I have an idea, put Newsom and other corrupt politicians in jail for crimes against humanity!"
Wouldn't it be great if the news anchors kid got thrown on fentayl island and couldn't come off.  The joking. The ignorance. The flip flop statements. What a disgrace you are.
"Yea....! Let's how bad it can actually get before they receive help.
Cancel tge current administration and this problem will go away."
"they put the dope on the streets, throw endless amount of $$$ at it (lol so they say) it actually goes into the ones that claim to be solving the problems bank accts! Its $$$ laundering and they dont care about the ppl they are MURDERING and stealing from. They never did and never will. As for the racism it also is man made to divide us for $$$$ and votes to keep their power."
"Newsome ,pelosi,fienstien,garsetti,,ectra.they are to blame along with colleges,hollywierd..all are to blame..ur leftist experiments all failed..yet they are still voted in."
Hahaha. So funny.... you anchors are just as low currently as they are.
Stop throwing money at the issue without responsibility and stop handing out needles.  Make the shelter like a Kibbutz.  You can live there...eat there .... but everyone had a responsibility to make the shelter function.  Offer job traing too.  And get them off street drugs.  Give them work at the shelter.
Another Demon-rat-infested cesspool descending into anarchy and chaos. Oakland has been a disaster for decades because of criminally corrupt Demon-rat control of everything.
looks what happens when liberals get a hold of your state and cities
The liberal Oakland experiment..failed!! As expected..
Where are the drugs coming from? Why not attack the source and then help the addicts to get sober? Stop the government from enabling it.
$120Million a year for 5 years = $600Million . OVER HALF A BILLION AND NOBODY KNOWS WHERE THE MONEY WENT ? the mayor and these scumbags he's greasing have successfully instituted the biden economics money laundering method at a civic level
"Legalization is what happened in CA, not decriminalization. It drives up medical costs, productivity loss, etc. It does not reduce crime."
biden is the worst president in all of American history the first president where I went down and purchased two firearms and I am 47 years old
If you reward poor behavior it cannot come as a surprise when you get more of it.
"We're the supposedly the wealthiest nation (also the deepest in debt - due to our bloated military), but our poverty problem is yuge.  The cause here is that the wealth sucked up to the top layer of the economy by engorged parasites is not available to anyone else."
"Only law abiding citizens allowed to stay, others are removed."
"Pharmacy  drugs are not safe. As a lifelong resident  of Nevada, let's put them in the middle  of the desert. Let them do all their drugs but they can't  come to or from the location  high or with drugs. They can have their own little crappy town till they die. I have no time or patience  for their crap."
Why would drug dealers poison their own supply?  You guys analyze each issue with a microscope and all you have to do is step back and look. And they will block this comment if I tell you why
"Wow, what a great tourist site!!"
"Hard to believe that the area they are showing is a homeless area. There isn't even one tent to be seen, never mind all the other things you would see for a homeless area"
It shouldn't take a genius to figure where the money. A 5 year old knows. IT WENT TO THE CARTELS PEOPLE.WAKE UP.
These non profits are total scams and need to be shut down.
"It trickles down from the top. For all, we know, some of you are making money off of this."
Walking the streets of Denver isn't much better. Some sidewalks are completely blocked off by tents and garbage. A business owner asked a homeless man to move his tent away from the front door so customers could come in. The homeless man attacked the business owner with a machete and almost killed him.
And California wants to run the country!!!! Democrats are a joke andd their voters even worse
How can any current politician NOT be put in JAIL!!
The waste of our money on this stuff really is sickening and criminal.
"It's not a homeless crisis it is a drug crisis brought on Democrats legalizing drugs and drug use. Democrats even supply the needles and so called safe places where they can do their drugs.
This is what a city on drugs looks like .....brought to you by Bidenomics"
ITS  WHAT  THEY  VOTED  FOR
Scott Adams proposed segregated housing and treating these people involuntarily years ago. I doubt it would work. We've learned beating addiction requires the addicted to be willing and invested in recovery. That doesn't happen if there in no impetus to change.
It's not a homeless problem. It's a drug and lack of giving a rats about being a part of civilized living problem.
This is what Democratic leadership gets a city and its citizens!
There is a solution for this but no one wants to hear it
"Lol, you used the Democrat to deliver the bad news."
"""They spent $120m a year over the last 5 years...the money disappears... no cabins...no-one can find out where the paperwork is...cartels control ...""  Sounds exactly how the ANC operates in South Africa."
That NWO agenda is in full swing
They will keep voting Democrat...
Greg is wrong. Back to law and order. The blonde is correct.
Fentynol is going to be our undoing. They are putting it in other drugs. It's way more addictive than any other drug and many young people experiment with drugs. Have been for decades. Nothing is going to change that. These people are out of touch with the real problem.
U got to let nature takes its course let them get the same thing as everyone else
"The amount of money California has spent on homelessness they could of given every single homeless person $80,000 each so where did the money go?!?!"
"The writers of the ""Wire"" wrote it into their script years ago!"
If the LEFTIES want to SAVE the PLAINET from environmental pollution this is where they should START!!!
"Drugs are bad in general, but fentanyl is very dangerous and deadly. Hate it"
ACCOUNTABILITY!
Just another dumbocrap utopia gotta love it.
Cyberpunk 2077 slowly incoming
"There has been no development in Oakland for years.  The NFL raiders left as well as the Oakland A,s.  What do u expect? Time to leave California."
This is really sad
"This is your country and your laughing while reporting, you're the trash polluting the country and advertising the governments lack of care. Those people need mental health help. Not a laughing reporter."
There are those who get off seeing people so destitute and they love wallowing in the drama. It gives the media pigs something to squeal about.
Wow that's Oakland wait what am I saying it's in  California that's normal
Don't give them support or money give them food and clothing. Do not I repeat do not give homeless any money they are just going to get more drugs.
Wonder if Ukraine has a fentanyl island
I love how these privalaged non entities find poverty and the collapse of american society  hilarious.
Notice how she named a bunch of blue cities
Slab city doesn't seem as bad as this?
You reap what you sow.
I would like more NEWS on the illegal bio lab they found in California!!!!!!!
"This is what the whole of America, including small towns would look like if Gavin Gruesome were to win the Presidency.  As  California goes....so goes the rest of the country."
This is what Liberals want! Give me free dope and we will keep voting Democrat!
UK is becoming the same because we're letting unskilled illegal rubber dingy people in who become drug mules or dealers. Hence drug doing lefties encourage them and oppose immigration control.
"Its not because they legalised drugs and needles, its because it was only in a small locality - so it became the dumping geound for the unresolved probelms due to America's failed drug policy. Look at Portugal for a model that works."

"Who cares, this is what they voted for."

Thanks to gruesome newsom
If there is no homeless there is no money in big guys pocket guys suppose to serve the people
Suspend these peoples civil  rights  build rehabilitation  facilities  away from the population
"Harold asking why is HILARIOUS!!!!!! 
Thank a f-ing democrat like him for the state of the nation"
The homeless have said that more new homeless come each day so I don't think this will end anytime soon.
I send these video clip to all the peoples around the world I know and warns them not to visit Comiefornia
"Put them to sleep with a drug cocktail using sterile needles in a clean environment layed back, and comfy in state institutions humanely..."
'My name is Max.  Max is my name.'
That is what happens - Colorado is doing much the same - free needles etc. Glad she mentioned small towns in CO.
"Mr. Ford's ""WHAT CAN WE DO"" ? That is the problem right there, ""WHAT CAN WE DO"" like you have no f*cking idea..."
I recognize that RV. Looks like one two men would use to cook a blueish meth out of.
"Hey dont laugh!, Mad Max times are comming soon to a neighborhood near you!, this is what Biden wants."
And Gavin Newsom is running for president!   This country is becoming such a joke!
Liberal policies at thier finest
Escape from Oakland
I left Oakland to rid this crap vote Republican use polices of 15 years ago put all drug addits in abandon mall east Mont mall and clean these people
Why build places for them? Just ship them to native  reservations ?
Feeding the addiction is not a good idea.  These people in charge are idiots.
Pharmacy drugs are not safe
1:40   Democrats steal our money and scream they need more to do nothing.
"Greg is right, all this fentanyl crap happened after they made it impossible to get oxycodone and Vicodin. If adults can purchase all the hard booze they want, all the NyQuil they want, all the weed and tobacco they want they should have access to opioids if they want. Fentanyl just fills the void in a very dangerous lethal way."
I wish they would make Ford their full time liberal on the show. He is actually reasonable.
That's normal in the usa today!
"The city lost The A's, Raiders and Golden State Warriors....what more do you need to see? A city that has lost 3 Professional sports teams(more like drove them out)doesn't deserve anything except KARMA."
Give them placebos let them think they're getting high.
People just need to leave Oakland and let the Democrats  and the homeless have the whole state.When there is no tax payers there and there is no one to pay  the Mayor's and city officals maybe they will  figure out how to get homeless off  the street and clean up these cities.I would not spend my tax dollars on living like this.Trying to go to work having to walk by or ride  and see this mess everyday.I would take my family and move to another state and change jobs.
"Incredible that one family started w this drug, then they sold it to Johnson and Johnson , then  the FDA approved it etc etc, and here we have it folks. And they blame the Mexican cartels?. Really?.. as always  government is behind this."
Take them truck load of dope and then let them be. They want to do this to themselves. Sorry no sympathy. Your government ignores the drug cartels for a reason. What could that be? Oh yeah billions.
Send the homeless to an island
"I have never seen so many people hate my God as I have in California. This is what they enjoy, kaos. They will get more than they want soon."
Seems like a primarily Democrat run area issue...
Thanks joe burden
SICKENING - We have serious problems world wide with starvation and homelessness
This is the future of this country ladies and gentlemen.  Always look to California and New York to see the future of national policies.  They always lead the charge in the direction where we as a society is heading.
thei4s two sides god and jesus. or satan and self worship
"This is what happens when you watch main stream media, which sadly Fox News has become!!! Fox is false news. 10,000 homeless??? Are you joking me???? That is NO WHERE NEAR TRUE!!! There are 10,000 per city you idiots. I live amongst this rif raf your supposeldy covering, your numbers are way wrong. Just keep supporting the current regime and watch it get worse."
Not In My Back Yard.
"Democrats are the Problem, Left is the Problem, Central Government is the Problem, this Is Why Democrats Hate Merits of Any Kind because Merits Show everything they Push is Pure Propaganda Cult BS, of course they will Lecture Not enough Money to Get more Money to Disappear into their Propaganda Cult BS, Democrats are the Problem, and we Still Wonder why Africa wants nothing to do with the WOKE West and they get to Slam the Door in Nulands Face like America Should Do"
I don't think republicans fear anything more than a homeless encampment.  Lol. They will always exist. If you don't like it... move.
Love all the black on black crime...they voted for it:)!!!!
Excellent work done by liberals led by Gavin Newsom.
I thought they were saving the planet?
"These reported seem to be very smuggy about this story, kinda like they are loving the fact that it's happening.. maybe not loving it, but they are acting weird. I don't know what it is, it's very strange."
Wow
Jesus Christ is coming soon
Boycott California ?
Tax money is no longer for America. It's to line the Politicians pockets and empower them to make them more powerful. Defund the Government!!!!
"Fox doesn't report the truth about what is going on. Why don't you tell people why this is happening? You know the answer to that. Yet you keep it from the people who tune into your network for news. This is why I don't trust Fox or any other news outlet. I was going to say ""with one exception, The Epoch Times."" But even they don't tell people everything that is happening. Our country is under attack by two foreign enemies, Xi Jinping of the CCP and Klaus Schwab of the World Economic Forum by way mostly of his Forum of Young Global Leaders members, like Vivek Ramaswampy, who like Rep. Dan Crenshaw of Texas, had his name removed from the list of YGL members when he realized it would be a major problem for his campaign. Vivek went a step further and had the WEF lawyers issue an apology letter claiming to remove his name because he's not a member of the YGL. This is garbage, it is all for show, and Vivek is lying like all of the YGL members do. Like Adam Kinzinger for instance who was on the J6 commission, appointed by Nancy Pelosi because she knew that as a YGL member, Adam would attack the Republican party like a good Klaus Schwab goon, and he did. Dan Crenshaw confused republicans by trying to take their gun rights away and voting against the majority of his party on such issues. They couldn't figure out why. Well, he's YGL, that's why, and they are attacking every western nation on the face of the earth. As Klaus put it himself, they have penetrated the cabinets in many nations and he even named a number of them. He didn't name Pete Buttigieg though, our current DOT Secretary appointed by Biden. Buttigieg is YGL, Klaus Schwab's goon. If a person is on that list or ever has been they should be disqualified from holding any position of power in the US.  You have reported on NONE OF THIS, yet every bit of it is TRUE!"
These cities and the state of California need to vote in a new type of leader. Like a conservative!
"Drug addiction and social degradation should never be acceptable or acommadated it sends the wrong message to future generations, send them to prison or rehab, but to give up and accept it is the worst ever thing you can do. I know I was a drug user for 30 yrs, a heroine addict and it took me years to get off them and I still fight it everyday. If I would of got a green light, go ahead I would be dead by now"
They should stop fentanyl. My grandson was killed by fentanyl. How many people have to die
"You people eat this sh*t up like hot cakes don't ya. Not all homeless are junkies but hey, the news only covers the bs about junkies. This garbage is exactly why people can't get help. You should all be ashamed of yourselves. Wait...it's only gonna get better."
an island? lol put em in prison like we used to.
"Rather than fix the water leak, they buy more vacuum cleaners. SOP"
"Why is there heavy equipment in a homeless camp,??"
This is want the left encourages.  They are on track to decrease the population.
Why is that my problem? Put a fence around it and don't let them leave.
It's so sad how they talk about these actual human beings like this how heartless do you have to be to not care and make jokes about this if this was your family or friends you wouldn't be treating them like this you would be wanting to try and get them help and try to get them better conditions and not try to act like these homeless people chose these horrible circumstances like be honest when is the last time you saw a homeless person vote I work as a poll worker and I know that you need to have your ID or a mailing address in order to vote by mail how are the homeless people voting for these laws that are apparently affecting them and has caused the situation half of these homeless people don't even know how to let alone even know how to get an ID so that they can vote there's no way that they ask for this for these conditions and all of these policies to be put in place that we're going to hurt them
...WE AMERICANS are useful as a Bloody Tampon.. A Vote of ABSOLUTELY NO CONFIDENCE in WE AMERICANS... Just a 30-plus year observation..
"Such misinformation, don't blame on democrats. Legalization of pot and glorification of the drug culture is the problem. Stop taking drugs idiots. It's not the governments problem to clean up stupidity. I agree put them on an island. My tax dollars need to be used better not to make fentanyl or illegal pills ""safe""."
Dumb
"If you r going to spend that much money, build rehab camps and detox them for 6 months and help them develop job skills."
Dead drug dealers at every level.

They can detox there
And their housing problems are solved"

"So basically you dweebos are suggesting exactly what Ron Paul suggested over 2 decades ago..

It's no surprise that they don't  have the intellectual ability to understand the true origines of this catastrophic societal collapse. Not that they are stupid, not at all, but they are living the american dream and for that you need to be asleep. You need to not see the reality, the fact that people are dying simply because they can't afford the medical care they need, the fact that hundred of thousand of people are living in misery deeper than what you could have a hundred years ago during the 1929 great depression. And the only ONLY reason is so a very few can have 500 meters square mansions and yachts and more and more and more.... Sharing is impossible when you have learnt since you were a kid that you must carry a gun to do your grocery. That you have to build a 10 meters high wall between you and your neighbour. But the small problem is that sharing will be the one and only solution when the population will have doubled, tripled....

The people I charge of that city need to be in prison or worse. Disgusting
Just like Somalia back in the early 1990s.  We haven't learned anything at all and just keep throwing money at the problem instead of accountability.
"So let's open our southern border for illegal aliens, what could go wrong?"
This is who you vote for.
Easily fixable... if you got the stomach for it.
"It's called apartheid, and SA got sanctioned for it, yet it worked, we scrapped it in 1994 and now most of South Africa looks like this fentanyl island."
Told yall we dont have a government
Never thought id say this. It looks worse than South Africa.
Yeah it's called prison or jail
Somebody needs suing.
And Newsom is going to be on the Democratic ticket for president in 2024
Chicago got more than 10k homeless by far
looks like mar a lago or trumps great America. it is no doubt a red state
Fox has zero insight it is shameful.
"Not all homeless are drugnaddic5s or criminals.  Some are nurses, barristas and restaurant servers.  FOX is clueless.  No empathy whatsoever.  Sadly most of these "" fentanyl island people"" are trump supporters.  Many suffer from mental illness.  What is Fox' plan for this besides shipping them to an island."
These ppl need be thrown away in a landfill gated up 2 hours away from the public.
Leftist policies are killing California. When will the voters wake up?
Is this in the United States?
Really? Get safe drugs from pharmacies? Loke oxycontin????
Keep voting for the Satanic Democrat party.
Got what they voted for
The only way to fix California is to give them what they voted for!!!!  Eventually the citizens will vote to change what is going on!!!
Its a reaally good thing the city banned those plastic straws tho! Could you even imagine how much worse it could be with people drinkin from straws?
Mostly peaceful car burning
Thats Biden's America
This Harold Ford is a piece of work
"Hey look, the apocalypse is happening from the inside out. Lovely. I'll be ready when this virus decides to spread."
I'm so glad California is crashing and burning. I wish every communist democrat run state and city look just like Oakland.
"Actually, Mad Max's wasteland looks more civilized than this monstrosity."
"""Escape From New York""?"
Greg called them safe because they are zombies from the fentanyl. What an idiot.
Is this what Kamala Harris meant about decreasing the poputaltion let homeless people die with drugs
"I think we need to NOT CONDONE DRUG USE! We should give stricter laws that make drug use, ie. White drugs and illegal script drugs, with more consequences. Coddling these folks isn't fixing anything. If you use drugs you will become indentured servants to the state for your drugs no workey no drugs! Period!"
Vote for people with common sense and an understanding they are servants.
"Well if this is your solution to the drug crisis, let's just go ahead and make temporary sterilization mandatory for anyone who receives public assistance. I mean, if they can't support themselves, why not make sure they don't bring more mouths they can't afford to feed into the world? Then, once they've proven they can keep a job, the sterilization can be reversed. Do the same with illegal aliens to avoid anchor babies. We'll be well on our way to utopia by segregating everyone so no one negatively affects anyone else and no one adds unnecessarily to society's burden."
LOL
NEWSOME for president 2024
Fake News -  Republican States are much worse.
Keep electing those Democrats
Well BUST a DEAL face the WHEEL welcome to THUNDER DOME
Serious Problems!! This is not Humanitarian!  How is this miss use of money used to treat people with NO CARE.   HOW CAN WE CHANGE????
Looks like africa
Utube hates free speech
Give out unlimited free pure fentanyl. Ban the narcan antidote. That'll go a long way towards a natural solution.
"The conditions there are what the Left wants EVERYWHERE!!!! Please America, wake up!!!!"
FIRE MARSHALL BILL IS REPLACING THESE POOR HOMELESS PEOPLE WITH ILEAGAL ALIENS !!!
Escape from Los Angeles comes to mind.  More winning programs by the Democrats.
"Heightened homelessness in and across the Nation, yet the Lottery is over 1 Billion near worthless, dollars.
Too sad to see this is what my country has spun into. . .  .  .  .   ."
"Liberal run City and they deserve everything that happens to them. There needs to be a real life ""Purge""."
Give me $120 million dollars a year and watch the homeless disappear
It would be funny if always sunny did a episode where cricket lives on fentanyl island
Gutfield in a sheep in wolf's clothing
"If were gonna have ""drug islands"" why just have LABOR CAMPS?!?
Its no less inhumane."
Jail them and cold Turkey.
"Yeahhh... feminism has really led the way of ""compassion"" rather than ""pragmatism"" in our nation, and voting patterns."
COMRADE NEWSOME AT HIS BIDENETTE FINEST !!! GOVERNMENT FUNDED DRUG ABUSE !!!
Show me ANY Republican run cities that look 1/10 this bad!
Chaffer Chimere Smith
and its moving to a home near you!
It mignt not be so bad if CA were to fall of the side of the planet after all.
"The locals deserve it as they voted for the Corrupt Politicians and Woke Prosecutors and will continue to do so,  could America pass a law to make the locals vote? Some countries make it a Criminal Offence not to vote."
"As they normalize illegal Fentanyl, they take away chronic pain patients legitimate medications. This is very disturbing and disgusting!"
This absolutely should not be happening ANYWHERE in this nation.
"When Greg said put them on an island, herald got in and racist too!"
"I grew up there in the ,90's and it was horrible then...I now live over an hour away and can tell you that I don't even drive through there now."
Bidenomics at work
Lot money in scrap I see thousands of dollars
"The money is going everywhere but where it is 
 intended"
They are getting exactly what they voted for...
That's whom getting the money cartels & the Mayer people in office.   Even if it dies the money going to benefit someone in office not public helping programs.     It the money stopped coming in the Mayer would make changes.
Soon to be renamed Oakland's K.O.A.
"Well there is a movie called ""Escape from New York"".  Kurt Russell is the main character."
As long as its not near Newsoms home nor the mayors home so its all good
Nobody becomes a politician because they care . Voting is absolutely a waste of time and naive .
coming to a city near you.
Obama Biden legacy FJB-FBO
He's got a really strange expression  botoxed on.
"Wow, you throw a insane amount of money at homelessness and you get more of it. Pretty simple stop the flow of money for homelessness."
Welcome to Americas future. We are done as a country
Zero sympathy. Enjoy living in the world you voted for.
"what you people Really need to understand is this,they Plan to have Newsome run for pres,and then turn All of America into commiefornia.
and dont worry,hell get elected off the mail in votes,just like briben did.
dont say i didnt warn you what is coming."
This was the storyline on the first season of The Wire. Didn't work then either.
"I have no idea what any of The Five had to say about this, I was staring at Katie's legs in high heels..."
Newsum wants to run the USA like he does California.  Vote Red 2024
Man this panel seems flat! Are they missing Tucker?
"Regardless of the state leaders, where is the DEA that has no problem raiding pot farmers in legal states?  FBI to investigate cartels?  What a sick joke."
"You are aware that zillow ""valued"" over 110 million houses in the U.S. Homeless comes first then drug use and then crime. No cash means no hope."
This is what Biden and his whole Administration want America to be
FGN
Moa had the right delusion. Get rid off all these losers!
"The shortest lived and most monitored homeless encampment in the country was just outside Spokane,Washington. 
It was there for mabe 2 years with constant police and private security presence. With port o potties. All paid for with taxpayer money. Everything in this video existed on a smaller scale. Now that it's been cleared the soil is so contaminated the top 12 inches is going to be removed, replaced and replanted."
"I'm being kept out of an apartment and I don't know why here in Madison, Wisconsin. I have a housing voucher. I've transferred from another state and they have even raised it up a little bit to meet the income level here but I still can't find anything.   I can't get past their background check because I didn't run up a bunch of credit in my life. I was blessed to have paid for the last two vehicles with cash. And now I'm 56 , disabled and no one will find an apartment for me. I have called and asked for help after being unsuccessful at finding one myself."
The new fallout game is looking amazing
The people of California need to vote for conservative politicians and stop running away from their cities and state -  this is the only way change will happen or California will be lost forever
"If Michelle does, she will come get me. I don't drive my truck except to work , it's too hot. She was trying to get hold of him."
"The Five is weak... they have no ideas, there than unconstitutional ones that won't fly.
Attack the politicians who closed residential psychiatric care facilities.  They also raised the legal bar for involuntary commitments, making the homeless problem... so humane to throw the mentally incapable out of a clinical setting where research was being done to advance treatment for mental illness, then tell them to go to 'outpatient care' if they need help.  Let them live under every bridge in LA, great idea..!  Taxpayer monies are wasted on stupidity, while the mentally ill make live unbearable in Loa Angeles."
"The common thread to all these bad cities, big and dem run; stop voting WEF liberals easy....."
Where the moneys goes  look in the mayors pockets
Now imagine Gavin Newsome being the president of the United States!!!!!!
Who would have thought there was money to be made in depopulating the country?
but Ukraine got their money!
DIdn't Kamala Harris run that town? Glad to see their support for climate change!
PUT THEM ALL IN DC!!!  LET THEM LIVE THERE!
And Dems want Newsome to run for president.
KEEP VOTING DEMOCRAT you morons!!!
"Oh,I thought it was Portland"

Drugs from the pharmacy aren't always safe; side effects are an issue.
"sounds like the movie ""Escape from New York""  or Escape from LA""  We need snake pleskin!"
The only people that can do anything about it is the people that live in the area to quit voting Democrat
120 million every year for last 5 years... mmmmm thats 600 million in the pockets of the liberal idiots
@tommyg
It made me think of Escape from LA and Escape from NY.
Thanks Joe!
Just sickening what is happening to this country anymore!!!!
Our govt gives billions to the world not homeless people fault rich people cause this with their greed and vanity
This is what I have been saying for years...our cities and mad max..no difference
Homeless Crisis is yet another way they can ask for more money to then usurp and use on something entirely different all while calling for yet more money and 'compassion' ... yeah THWT ... put it on public officals front porch on blast ... like you do with a cat or dog that went wee where they were not supposed to you rub their nose in it so they get the point..
Democrats cities and states.
Unreal !!!!
"Laughing about fentanyl island.
That's pretty despicable."
"There is nothing you can do they are already dead inside,so they don't care for there own lives. Just let them make there choice."
"Not all voters in California VOTED for this!!!  NEWSOM, began destorying California on his first day as Governor!  He doesn't care about the PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA!  He continues to wipe his feet on all of us.  His true goal is to become the President of the United States!  Now, everyone, close your eyes, and IMAGINE that!  GOD, help us all if that happens."
Dont mistake the clean needle program with the ruin of the working class and the rising rents Jesse. Good call Gutfeld. Legalize it!
"What does anyone think is going to happen when you shut the entire world down for 2-3 years? The Democrat cities have been locked down and/or service sector (non essential jobs) were shut down for 3 years in these cities. I am in Washington - actively selling my house at a loss - to get the hell out of this drug infested sh*t hole that is only getting worse. Gregg: Legalization does NOT make there drugs safe! Look at mariuana - the crap they are selling is MANY times stronger than any weed we had in the 70/80s! Forcing sobriety aka treatment will not work until someone actually wants to change their life - none of these people want to do the work to better themselves. This has all gone on for far too long and now we have a monster of a crisis on our hands. Only solution I can think of is create a city - lock them down in it and let nature take its course. Interview them before sending them to see if they want treatment - drug test daily - pop positive once - you go to the lockdown city. Its better for the rest of us to not have to see it and walk through it every day. Its disgusting, its scary and it is UNSAFE."
well we should just make california the island and just let it implode !
STOP CHINA FROM PUMPING FENTANYL INTO THE UNITED STATES! SECURE OUR BORDERS! CHINA IS AT WAR WITH THE UNITED STATES AND WE ARE NOT FIGHTING BACK!!!! STOP ILLEGAL MIGRATION! THE REMOVAL OF EVERY DEMOCRAT LIBERAL PROGRESSIVE FROM ALL OFFICES AND JUDICIAL POSITIONS! THAT WOULD BE A GOOD START!
Look in the mayors packets .
If Rupert M. didn't have to pay Dominion 787 million dollars he could have spent it to help those people. What a stupid man.
"These addicts must come to the realization that theywant to get clean & get jobs like the rest of us. If not, then the alternatives must be harsh, very harsh."
Why don't the Oakland homeless go to San Francisco across the bay? I think it would be nicer.
"What really makes me angry, is that this state is so beautiful in many ways from north to south. It is also being ruined from north to south."
Vote blue for Hell on Earth
Gov Gavin Newsom is ultimately responsible. But each insane Democrat liberal mayor contributes as well. They should empty out all the homeless & addicts and dump them over the Mexican border. And don't let them back into CA or into USA.
"You want a quick solution - ever seen the movie ""Escape from New York""?"
Seems to me like with all the homelessness there nobody would be stupid enough to let the mayor or anybody else gaslight them at all. That is unless they want to be gaslighted.
Why are we talking about this? As they vote and want this let them live this way.
Could be drugged or mob-related but I'm wondering is California killing the homeless? I mean after all they encourage them to come there..
Ground zero for Democrat policies
"Is this Biden's ""Build Back Better"" program?"
This is all by design.    But in the end God wins
"What a disgrace!!
All those who run this city should be forced to live here until it's cleaned up since they are the ones responsible for the decline!"
This is how The SCUMBAG democrats want you to live.
Hello! That is the breaking bad camper! Walt and Jesse blew it up
"Throwing money at this problem and more ""govt programs"" is not the snswer.  It's the problem."
"I recommend watching a Ted talk ""addiction isnt what you thought"" He advocates for total legalization of all drugs BUT addicts are also given jobs, shelter and through their sense of having a purpose, being plugged in, someone counting on them, not being tossed aside to die.... Many, the majority have thrived - he's talking about Portugal.  As an addict living south of Chicago, yet a conservative, Christian, libertarian/Republican Trump fan, i have to mention that sometimes the data shows one outcome vs another outcome and only a variable may exist which will alter the consciousness and connection of the humans on this planet."
Opioids and similar are not decriminalized in Oakland
*let them eat cake*
"This looks like a 2nd or 3rd world country. Thanks democrats, Obama and Biden. 
The idea that throwing more and more money will solve any issue has been disproved for decades. The proof is visual in the large cities. As you introduce money in to a problem-homelessness, education especially higher education, you get this rot and more and more people flock to these areas to collect entitlements being thrown at them. Stop the flow of money!"
WTH is even that
"As a multiple year clean ex fentanyl addict, I've been suggesting a fentanyl island where all junkies can go get there clean drugs and do them , and yes they will have to stay there until they are clean for awhile..."
"Why does Henry remind me of a loaf of soft, light-brown dog poop?"
"People forget. Liberals are against boundaries, law and order and morality. 
Complete freedom."
The democratic agenda...they want all of America like this
Fake white fear mongering. They are going to be sued again
Gavin Newsom has nothing to offer to the country. And that is why he may become the president.
""" We"" shouldn't be supporting this ? Why did that liberal fool say that ? Why include people that are not part of the problem ?
That is a democrat run city. A democrat problem."
"Letting it all burn is precisely the answer that's needed. Fire is cleansing. Unfortunately, what needs to be cleansed is liberalism which has spread across the country."
Soon New York will be like  the movie Escape from New York remember that one ! My husband said that was what America was going to come to and he said that ten yrs ago !!!
Looks like parts of every large city in Oregon.. It's unreal.
Tell me you want concentration camps without telling me..... This is basically the story line of the Twisted Metal tv series.
No! What your seeing here is a leftist run blue city.
Legalizing is stupid. There is no legitimate need nor profit to society of recreational fentanyl.
"Absolutely  the choice of the ""Unhoused"" unless You give them Housing, W/Utilities And NO RULES , they can do what ever they want to do,  to ""their"" housing.  And how can you make Heroine Any safer?? They have ""safe"" injection sights all over Oakland SF , So Cal . How can they make Heroine safe Gutfield?  that's one I've never heard, ... I have a family member addicted to Script, and if it wasn't for His wife supporting Him and putting a roof over His head, he'd be homeless,  can't hold a job,  and This is Your so called ""Safe"" from a Pharmacy drug. So stupid to even say that,  and no one called you on it.  Wow, just Wow"
"What the hell is the president doing? Oh, that's right, the jerk has a druggie for a son. He's ""the smartest person he knows""! ! !"
Isn't placing all the drug addicts on a separate island or property just incarceration by another name? Maybe they could reuse Alcatraz Island. There's the remains of a prison already there.
"I disagree with Greg on legalizing drugs. If they aren't free, addicts will steal to buy them."
A bus load of fentanyl burning and bodies rotting in the heat but the governor of California is only worried about lawnmowers using gasoline
"Democrat solution: legalize shoplifting. Result: more crime, drugs, homelessness, and closed businesses."
"Democrat ""solutions"" do not solve problems."
California has to change who they elect into the governor's office because our taxes are going to pay for homelessness and drug addiction.
Do these fking libs not get all this garbage seeps into the ground and is bad bad bad ?How fking dumb are these demos to think this is ok ???3rd world country is on the door step because of fking BIden .
"it's called ""concentration camps "" for addicts.some people don't deserve to live among ""good"" people."
"I can almost hear Riccardo Montalban  saying smiles everyone smiles, and little Tattoo running up sayin The plane the plane Boss. that's a different Island"
Californians deserve everything they get
"Way to go Nancy. I think she has wanted to ignore her elected duties in hopes the DEMs would want her to run for president.  After all the DEMs concider the POTUS is a geriatric position and VP is for a Democrat moron. I don't see how the democrats could do any worse than Wet Brain Harris. OH wait! There is the AOC who is a very accomplished puppet. With any luck, California could slip into the ocean."
May I say something  the person in the White House is only damaging our great nation if he is not impeached or thrown out  we will take it from his hands and put him back in the sewer where he belongs in the  enormous pile of  dooky  him and his coke head kid selling united information for wealth  get that pile of crap out of the white home now and everyone  that is in bed with him
There's the result when ppl keep voting for politicians that refuse to do their jobs.
"And Gavin Newsome wants to be President some day! UGH, Democrats"
Alcatraz isn't doing much anymore
0:40 Bass-taytions? Dammit! Who let a white guy write the cue cards?!?
"Have mercy on us all father, one living God most high lord God Christ Aman my love .did I see this evil hideous creature do with his hand Gestures , His hand movement is hypnosis  ? What I interpreted he just told the people that the devil's over the son and the holy ghost ,father.  That's my interpretation anybody got any feedback ?"
"These are human beings, and their families are probably searching for them.  The solution is to close the borders to slow down the flow of drugs into the country.  Then, decriminalize the use of narcotics prescribed by physicians and filled by legitimate pharmacies.  Fund drug treatment programs managed by behavioral health facilities, and coordinate case management services to connect participants with transitional housing, food, medical and employment services."
Nuisance should be jailed for life!
Gavin Newsome is responsible for this war zone....then he wants to criticize others like DeSantis....what an idiot !!!!!!!!
Thank God my wife and I left CA a few months ago!!!!
Is there a hidden agendment behind this? Why would they let  this happen? A lot of trends start out west and move their way east. (New York)? (Chicago)? Let all hell brake loose like what's been happening last few years. (Portland)  Are they looking to have a police state run country in time? It's sad!
Neo-United states of north America
Why are they using the drugs ? Answer that question and you'll solve the problem.

staggering how today's world looks more like a zombie apocalypse game.
"We need to stop running and handing our cities and town's to drug addicts, immigrants and certain cultures. We have to stand our ground and take them back."
Send in the national guard
These days you can make a living off scrap metal by picking up syringes in liberal cities.
"But surely until you give these people help and get them jobs and a house, then there will slways be people like this on our streets. I know we dont like seeing homeless or drug addicts laying on our streets, however unless you give these people a way to survive and a way to earn money legitimately then  a massive amount of this problem won't ever go away. I think its a bit harsh to basically stick humans with real problems in essentially a land fill site. Just so you dont have to look at them. Im pretty disappointed with the lack or humanity that news reader displayed."
Don't be fooled Oakland has been drug/crime island for decades.  This is nothing new.
if you over dose 16 times then you get shipped off to an island. I LOVE IT !
The dems are useing private companies and contracts to get the tax payers money.then these companies go and put the lost/stolen money into the dems election.
They are quick to say this is also in small towns and that it's all over the country. This is why I don't watch faux news
"Decriminalizing drugs and providing needles to the homeless is an attempt to reduce the population and costs for the cities.......it's cheaper to bury people than it is to incarcerate them , house them or help them......sorry its actually a form of genocide.......and Greg.....the legalized drugs aren't good enough for the addicts.....they sell the legal drugs and buy the stronger street drugs......nothing gets better"
Thank you Democrats!....
'Escape from New York' is becoming reality ... except it's only drug abusers instead of a mixed bag of convicts
CCP Sponsored Cartels Control amerika and Therefore - US(A) !
Government is creating big businesses out of homelessness and drug addictions. They throw tax payer money at problems without forethought or oversight leading to everyone with issues coming to get everything for free while not having to work towards a better way of life. This is the fleecing of America in action.
California supports drug use.  They wanted this. The people still vote dem. Let it burn
"Legalization is NOT the answer, you don't take the criminals out of the equation. Colorado has proven that with marijuana. Our county has several busts a year of illegal grows. Legalization only adds to the problem because the public parks become more riddled with people that can't move, drug parafinalia left everywhere, exposing children to drug residue and needles. Gutfeld sounds like a liberal. Very disappointed."
"They really think that's going to work, fentanyl island???  Ridiculous!"
Just use that 100 mil to build mental institutions and lock all these zombies up
Unfortunately it's a problem no one wants to take care of...throwing $AT IT IS NOT THE ANSWER!
Watch the movie escape from new york.
Insanity. This is DEMOCRAT DYSTOPIA IN OUR NATION! INTENTIONALLY DONE!
"Looks like the rest of the big cities in California.  Last time I was in Oakland, it looked like the trash dumped moved to down town.  Just like this.  All over!!!!  SMH"
The violence is coming from the dealers
They may as well have used that 120million dollars as kindling to start that fire

"At first I thought we were going to see pictures of Russian or Ukrainian war devastation.
A note to anyone reading this, WE, Californians, did not vote for Gavin Newson and we did vote to impeach him. However the corrupt democrat voting machine originates from California."
This is absolutely sickening and horrendous. The people who are in charge needs to be held accountable. And the public needs to vote responsibly
You go democrats.
Let it all burn
Homless industrial complex!
Brian needs to be canceled
Stop who's getting rich off the drugs. Make the drugs supply dry up.
Bring in the national guard and arrest them and force them into therapy.
And Bozeman Montana is next in line to look like this. Urban camping is not illegal in Bozeman so it's out of control.
"Totally, completely inexcusable."
This is going to be spreading all across America in every state if you'll allow it because every policy has been thrown at helping homeless people does not address the two issues... drug use and mental illness... both of which will demand facilities and trained personnel who will lock these people away from society until they are clean sober and mentally fit to join society.
"Yeah, all that money went in rich people's pockets.  Like most of our tax dollars. America has a corruption problem."
"YOU NEED TO EXAMINE YOUR HEART NEWS MAN BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE HAVE MENTAL ILLNESSES THAT NEED IMMEDIATE HELP!!

"Humanity needs social rules and regulations. Everyone degrades themselves and makes a mess at some point. The point of society is to recognize and try to limit our weakest impulses. People can function properly with Marijuana, alcohol, etc. Fentynol, Meth, and the other hard drugs obviously are contradictary to functioning society."
This is happening in places in Florida
Democrap strong hold.

If there was a racist island that man would be on it. Hot mike last three seconds.

Legalized suicide.

What is wrong with Americans that they voted the Democrates in office? They are destroying the country fast. Very fast.
This is absolutely disgusting and the California government has done nothing. This is not the America that I grew up in. Thank the democrats for this mess.And you want to keep them in office.
"Load em up put em in a camp , and keep them locked up in that camp where they have to stay , make em farm the land to eat"
That like giving money to Operation Freedom paying mercenaries to do soldiering under the USA Banner. 250 billion for the Ukraine Battlefield doesn't seem to make it all day that's why they must need so much.
vote gop!
"they do not want their onw space, they do not want to be away, they want your space they want to be next to you"
"Exactly, this will look like mad max is letting this bad government continue"
"with foreigners coming in and leftists left unchecked and them moving to conservative states and them filling conservative states with foreigners, THAT is your future, for the whole country, make no mistake, IT is by design, there is no uhauling or voting out of this, make peace with it"
"Who is this fool mixing ""dead bodies with human trafficking"" (0:44) ? 
What about Jay Walking and littering...?  Gimme a break, all the latest ""Buzz Words"" for the viewers to Ohhh & Ahhh over.
The news media is a wasteland like the ""Mad Max"" reference... gimme some commercials so I can finally understand something "
So the big farms secretly put out this drugs and then the Media makes a point of the ends result but never tries to go into a deep search about how all this started . Who you gonna blame the People or this Illuminati  politicians making some of us go crazy .
"It's all by design , the worse it gets the more money that comes in.  California elite are profiting and that's the design ."
"""we should do that with the racist's too"" does that include you as well? What a stupid statement."
"People netter wake up and stop being played by this liberals. Its a quote in the bible that says ""because they believe the lie, i will sear it in their heads onto  damnation."" God has turned manl over to a repobate mind that cant reason. The lie being, this gender bull, no cash bails , legalize fentanyl smh"
"And in 2024, ALL OF Oakland will line up and STILL vote democrat"
America The Beautiful.
Greg is so pro drug use he should be a drug dealer
Democratic cities and states sure know how to take care of their people.
"Has anyone on the five watched the movie ""Escape from New York""? That's what America is coming to but it's not for criminals it's for druggies."
Escape from New York?  Escape from LA?  Anybody?
What is the issue that is the Democrats utopia
"We should just get rid of Biden 2 duh,  there's a reason these people are in power."
"Amurica, the home of racism, the desperate and zombies. The Undertaker of Amurica, Biden, is doing a great funeral."
Looks like Armageddon
You voted for this well there it is
"All blue states,  let them burn down"
Denver's city council encourages drug use and homelessness. My neighborhood has turned into an open drug party. Smoking fentanyl in front of the police is no biggie now it's crazy!!
Instead of legalization of all narcotics. Why not offer free full scripts of Methadone and give each 3 months to one year to start start a ckass or job?
The Globalist G*vin N*wsom has it under control ... wink wink.
Make asylums great again
biden regime at its finest keep voting for democrats
When i retire im moving out to my land that i inherited in central alabama. Build my cabin dream home. Bye oakland bye felicia. Bye drug alley & filth.
"Gutfield claims these people don't  have a care in the world. If he knows that little about addiction, maybe he should keep his idiotic opinion to himself."
This is what the Democrats want. This is a simple way to decrease the population. Everyone needs to watch the movie The Purge 1 and 2.
Drag the mayor out of his office and force him to live in the homeless camp for a day
"The trash, comes from all the illegal dumping from the citizens of oakland. Yeah they dig through it, but that's a shame"
Try that in a small town.
And there's the only one party you can blame this on they've been in control of California forever time to flip to the Republicans and give them a chance at they clean it up what an embarrassment
Escape from Oakland! Wth
They want to luck us in out home again because some fake diseases there where the diseases come from
"I was stationed there in the 70's, this is so wrong."
"Leaders without guts, produce these results.
Now Pelosi's clown prince of this mess.....wants to be prez??"
Not a lot of robberies??? who you think is braking in all these cars and houses you racist rhino!
Get a president in there that will clean up this madness. THIS IS NOT AMERICA
"Little Towns in Washington out of Control... They gave them housing Apts.and Hotels.. Furniture, Food, Clothing, Free Money, And They take from Stores anything they want no one does anything. Jesus needs to Come!"
lefties wanted this
"minimizing opioid abuse saying crack addicts where more violent typical racist republicans, LOCK EM ALL UP!!!"
"that last comment about ""do that with the raciest too""  you are the first one on the island,  you promote racism ."
"It all started with jobs not paying enough for survival. Which leads to homelessness, which leads to depression, that in turn leads to drug us, and we end up with this. No resources causes people to eat each other, like at sea. So greed will lead to chaos."
That # is probably even higher than 10 thousand homeless people
Will there no money to make in America no one wants to pay now days to many rich greedy people in america
Vote Blue!  Go California!
Show this 24 7 and maybe the ILLEGAL ALIENS will STOP COMING!
DRUGS ARE DECRIMINALIZED IN WASHINGTON D.C.
These people have got it wrong as usual. Recently we looked for veteran homeless in one county in Florida and found at least 10000 in one county. They went to the next county and guess what. More than the last. This went on until most of the central parts of the state were looked at and indeed we expect the count to be well in to the 100000 mark when we are finished. Not finding a lot of veterans but have found some. No one can get in their camps but us other veterans so we have some work to do. But look at Florida and we wonder why the governor is absent and this is a major issue with his own voters. If he doesn't get on this soon trump will clobber him with this in that their people have become aware of this
"How do we help?   We can't because THEY don't want help.  Same with any addict, you can't help.   Money didn't help, social workers didn't help.  Teach them the only help they need is at the end of their arm,  THEY have to pull themselves out."
Thank the crooked Democrats for this!
SO COOL MAN!
This is sick!!! Looks like 3 rd world country
"I have a 4 week plan to solve the drug problem..
1 establish drug clinics to dispense free fentanyl, yes it will be 100 % free
2 the fentanyl will be given in large quantity  doses
3 the fentanyl must be consumed on premises 
4 a free grave will be given in random cemeterys

We will assist the addicts in thier end goal,achieving thier ultimate high/trip.

Our goal will be shortly reached,the users will weed themselves out of society."
"It looks worse than a madmax movie, looks more like a garbage dump"
And this is what Obama and and Joe Biden wants for America!
"Arrest them. I was a fentanyl user, was arrested for possession and selling, and came out sober and happy I was in jail. It changed my life for the better!"
