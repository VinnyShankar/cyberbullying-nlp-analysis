Why do I feel bad for a theif?  because he is only targeted by that cop because it is the one man that a fat donut eating fool can catch easily without any physical effort. . .a handicapped man w only one leg. . .the cop is the good guy technically in that video but I am rooting for the man to get away and make it to his concert illegally and I know that is wrong but sometimes bad behavior vs worse behavior makes the sin or crime in this case (if it has to be one evil vs another) more acceptable than the law enforcer's reaction to it
5:45  Spongebob Square Pants chant repeat whenever you cant understand what is being screamed in a protest march or demonstration or rally. . .just yell out about your favorite yellow shape under the sea   or just go Patttttrickkkkk Baby Boyyyyyyyyyyyyyy from Eternal Sunshine and the Spotless Mind which happens to be my favorite American film of all time followed ever so closely by the best British film of all time Remains of the Day
