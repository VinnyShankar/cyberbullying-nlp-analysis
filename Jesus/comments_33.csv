"no reason why iron man team would not win.

Logically Antman should stomp and kill on everyone."
"wow how the mighty have fallen, mcu used to be spectacular!"
"this battle scene is cringe. they all really holding back. because ironman can easily kill all of them in less than 5 seconds if he wants to. remember Iron Man 1? the target missile? also ironman not using his utilities to fight is cringe to see, yet he goes melee combat during this fight lmao"

"i finally get why thor and hulk aren't here. Because the team that has them, will automatically win so there wouldn't be a point to fight lol"
at 00:34  that punched from tony on cap's sheild slipped and hit the ground. that was so powerful that broke the concrete.
I love how captain America had mercy on Spider-Man and proceeded to have a conversation with Peter after beating his ass
https://youtube.com/@amezings046
"3:12 is actually a really deep line, because it's Ant-Man calling out how Tony Stark doesn't consider the ethics and morals of his actions any longer. These things will pass over an average viewers head."

Wanda is mvp and also warmachine is mvp
Who will win team iron man or team captain America

"Man, I would love to see more of Peter and Steve's interaction."
"If Thor & Hulk were in this fight , Thor would have been Team Cap (obv reasons) and Hulk would have been Team Ironman"
I don't see Vision doing a lot of  fighting
They should have had some character die from this battle and that would be the moment they all look around and ask why they are fighting each other
Vision and Wanda are like overpowered characters so they choose support roles lol.
"Seeing Peter fight Cap made me realize something:

Spider-Man is a tricky opponent. One minute you're fighting as you always would and then all of a sudden your limbs could be webbed and restricted in a variety of different ways and overall webbing amount, which in turn can make the webs stronger and/or more complicated to break free of. 
His main defensive tactics rely on space, agility, and speed. All the while restricting his opponents movements and being a constant threat, which makes him a hard target to fight directly as you normally would. He can reach high spaces relatively quickly as well, which allows him to retreat, rethink, and reanaylze the situation.

The reason Cap won is because he realized those strengths and figured out how to counter Peter's abilities. If you look at it again closely you'll see what I mean."
And that ant man is always modifying his suit

fact: Captain didn't know that spiderman is strong enough to lift that thing. he just want to crush him.
I don't like civil war beacause I want everyone not fight and be friends and just fight Thanos
Spider-Man fans think that Peter Parker should've been the next Captain America.
It's sad these are the only  2 scenes that we get with Spider-Man and Captain America.
Wanda could've murderers the Avengers 10 times over. What kept her at bay was Vision.
I swear this is gonna be funny when our future kids see this movie like we see old Iron man

-Marvel fans vs DC fans 

-Mortal Kombat fans vs Street Fighter fans

-People who consider the Super Smash Bros games as fighting games vs People who don't consider the Super Smash Bros games as fighting games

-People who consider movies like Die Hard, Batman Returns & Iron Man 3 as Christmas movies vs People who don't consider Die Hard, Batman Returns & Iron Man 3 as Christmas movies

-Collectors vs Scalpers 

-Wal-Mart vs Target

Antman (along Wasp and the ants)
Wanda (as the Scarlet witch)

Iron man had the killer squad
For those who say cap threw a hanger on kid he did see that the kid was able to kick his ass
I don't understand how in these movies someone can take a kick to the head and the result of the impact sends the entire body flying like it was hit by a car.  Shouldn't the head at least respond to the force a lot more than... everything else? 1:23
Always be team Iron man

I always wondered how Cap knew Spidey was strong enough to catch the jet bridge.

"Rebellious Chaotic Good nationalism (Team Rogers) versus obedient Lawful Neutral globalism (Team Stark). Team Rogers was right. Also, globalism in our timeline is Lawful Evil. Nationalism is typically thought of as a Lawful Good philosophy. That is, ""resistance nationalism"" (in the style of the Czech Resistance). But when Hydra-like imperialists are oppressing The People, then it's time for nationalist freedom fighters like Captain America to become Chaotic Good.

Note: Globalism and imperialism are the same thing."

Why were they fighting

Still Team Captain America for here until now

"Wanda herself can disrupt the whole arena
What was Marvel doing at that time..."
"""He also said to go for your legs""

*Proceeds to web his hands*"
It's crazy to imagine that each one of these characters in their own movie or tv show is like a one person army.
It's funny how people say it not fair with cap and bucky at then end but when u see this fight all of iron man team try taking down cap but fail
favorite movie for me
0:03 when she realizes that she's the only one without an armor. And spider man can literally bench press 10 tons
Daredevil should have appear in Captain America: Civil War.
Why did they fight?

"What If iron man creates an armor and gives it to everyone including vision. 
Guess cap couldn't hold it"
very good movie
I am with iron man team

What if captain America just killed Spider-Man lol
"God, I hate Wanda."
Wtf 200 million views let's go
Looks like a super smash Brothers
Scarlet Witch was using 5% of power.
Everyone fighting because they know each other. Black Panther is fighting to kill.
"If Ant-Man stayed quiet, could he have shit down Tony's suit?"
think legau the avengers minus the black widow
"T'Challa being black and asking Bucky, ''Why he ran if he was innocent?'' is kind of an interesting take. I mean, I guess you could say T'Challa doesnt get out much and that Wakanda is a very isolated country, so racism and racial profiling wouldnt be a thing he ever experienced in his life.

But thats me overthinking it, was an interesting take none the less."

"I think, between this, ragnarok, iw and endgame, marvel was at its absolute peak. The story telling, the way this universe moved forward, all the emotions, everything was so perfectly well-written."

Spidema is more stronger in civil war than endgame
Its funny now were all aware Wanda at her peak could just erase everyone with ease.
why can't spiderman fly black Panther destroy sun just with his eye captain Marvel pick up the whole building and throw iron man divide the earth into two... since mc marvel has no logic just magic and crush on lawri wanda
This video got million likes because of Chadwick Boseman RIP
without scartlett caps team would lose..
Spider-Man from no way home could have easily handled captain America
"At the time, have never sern a fight of this magnitude on the big screen. Theatre was dead silent during the buildup as the music intensifies and the charge torwards eachother...I agree with some of the other comments, if the Scarlet Witch of present wouldve entered this fight, she wouldve made short work of all of them."

Black Panther: his cousin Killmonger trying to kill him"
"Cap was such a dick in this film, makes me wonder how he was ever worthy enough to lift that hammer. Its no wonder Tony went on to get his own back by giving him a fake shield."

You know... Tony would have been royally screwed if Scott didn't start talking when he was inside the Iron Man suit. The only reason why Tony's suit was still functioning was because Scott had to open his damn mouth.

Spider man vs Tor amazing
"If Cap chooses to live on as a Captain America, will Wanda turn into Scarlet Witch?

I personally think that he's the one who's responsible for some of her sufferings."
The Black Panther suit in this movie was the best version.
Where were The Incredible Hulk/Bruce Banner and Thor during Captain America: Civil War? We do know that they were on Asgard (Along with Loki) in Spiderman: Homecoming and The Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 as those films take place during Thor: Ragnarok.
Its hard to actually see both Ant-Man and Falcon together on Team Captain America despite their differences from Ant-Man (2015).
Wanda and Vision are the higher levels that go easy on the lower ones
I think wanda wins the fight
I miss this kind of marvel movie
Cap was always weaker then tony they only won cause of wanda here and the final scene was only cause it was a 2 vs1 on a heavily damaged Tony I always hated the plot armor cap got no matter what side he's on
0:21 Oh Boy here We Go!
Ihapar wanda akela sabko marne ke liye kafi thi

Only Wanda can defeat everyone

"I love how much resasonable Wanda was and she basically carried team captain. 
And no one can change my mind, like she was the only one who defeated ironman effortlessly and was helping all her team which was about to get sucked up"

"you can tell how lopsided this fight should be by the non existence of Vision in it compared to how much the witch is involved. I guess they had top make it interesting, cuz these teams are lopsided if Vision does something."

Wanda alone could have won the battle.

"1:56 in the entire marvel cinematic universe, this is the one scene i really really really hate... ""he also said to go for your legs"" next second he goes for his arms..."
Imagine ghost rider join the fight
Anybody else think that when they walk and then jog and then run at each other about Lion King 2: Simba's Pride?

"This is an unpopular opinion, but they really should've kept this scene for the final act and should have the heroes actually trying to kill each other. Also... how does Peter doesn't question if Stark is right?"
Better than end game last fight
Have all three spider men gang up on Captain America just to have Tobey McGuire put some dirt in his eye.
"WANDA (AKA) the new Bonnie Bennett

Torched up there to fight
This movie felt more like an avengers movie than just Captain America..having almost all the avengers in one movie fighting against each other
Jis hisab se doctor strange multiverse of madness me dikhaya gya hai us hisab se to wanda akele hi kafi hai sab ke liyer
"This film should have been called
Avengers: Civil War"
Pretty wild that every character in this scene has had (one is about to have) their own titled Marvel movie or TV series. Each character is a franchise by themselves. MCU is wild.

"scott lang couldve just turned small, go inside thanos's asshole and turn back to normal in infinity war that wouldve made thanos's organs blow up and billions wouldve gotten saved"
Yayyy this massive movie about superheros fighting each other only has one battle with many superheros fighting each other
"when i think about it in endgame they go back in time, on the 1st movie maybe itony think that somehow these something go inside to his reactor i mean he build that reactor to be durable hence: he make a fire supretion system in his armors and reactor"

Thor would've killed someone if he was there. He IS the strongest avenger indeed.
"He,s. Iron.man"
Te preocupes que no te preocupes
This so sad to watch Rip team Ironman
Scarlet Witch is LOGIT a the most Powerful superhero EVER
Lets just be honest if wanda wasnt in this fight 2 ppl wouldve died already before a minute into the fight
Movie koun si hai
"I love that ,,who's speaking"""
So many views
I'm wondering y didn't ant man just go big in ironman suit....
Ooooooo ooooo ooooooooooooooo ooooooo oooooo
Spider man is cool
"Now that I think about it, Spiderman would probably be against the accords. SM is a vigilante through and through, and his whole shtick is that if you have the power you do, and don't stop something, it's your fault"

"I love how after her first encounter with Ant Man, Natasha completely wrecks him before she goes on to fight Clint"
"20 years later: 

Peter Parker: It's good to meet you Miles. Where are you from?
Miles Morales: Brooklyn.
Peter Parker: (chuckles) Queens!




Yes Miles Morales is from Brooklyn. You can look it up and you'll see that he is."
Iron man fans like this comment
"A
AAA"
"Team Iron Man has the blockbuster heroes: Iron Man, Black Panther, Spiderman."
"As I watched and rewatched Marvel movies I realised that Captain America is a jerk and only fights for himself and his own beliefs. He is not a team player and never thinks for the people rather has his own agenda and always puts others at danger just to pursue his desire and regrets.


On the other hand Tony learned from his mistakes and we see him grow with each movie and experience, he always has a plan and he grows from being selfish to be compassionate, loving and selfless who ends up sacrificing his life for others unlike Captain who chose retirement to pursue his life's desire. He could have stayed as people needed a leader once Tony was gone."
Thor ve Hulkun hatri kalicak
Wanda is the most powerful in this movie

"Captain America and the badasses vs. team clown suits. Gotta love that, kek."
If Hulk on this fight it was going to be so awesome
Iron man Team is better.
"Back when marvel was at their peak. The story telling was just amazing, but now we're just in some kind of roller coaster."

Bruh Wanda out here acting like she can't just kill them all easily
This was her being reasonable
If there was a raimi's black suit spiderman instead of tom holland would have easily kill captain within second.
