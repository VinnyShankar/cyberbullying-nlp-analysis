One man army . Zigler
I think dolph Ziegler performance is underrated in this match
Sui
Ziggler
Suppur
It was so hilarious how they pumped up mark henry only for him to get knocked out by big show
Dolph ziggler really held his own against all of team authority by himself props to him
Team cena
Great match.
This is one of the best performance Dolph ziggler in wwe
Sting vs undertaker dream match
This taku  is criminal .and failor. Its very bad. Zhonsena grups gainor .
Dolph ziggler really won a 3v1
sue big show for doing that cuz they still have s chance then big show punched jonh cena sue big show
Omg the way Rusev jumped face first into the announcer table is so funny HAHAH
162 million views is crazy...
FULL MATCH - Team Cena vs. Team Authority - Elimination Tag Team Match:

Hello
One of the best match ever. Great job Dolph ziggler. BIG SHOW gave up and he only eliminated john cena. Dolph ziggler defeated 3 of them in the end and won the match.
Dolph is a legend
HI
Zigler smart performance but cena always never ever give up its forgery to quit authority
I hate a big show
I hated when kane was like that they made him not scary
muito top
Came k
Dolph ziggler be like: I can do this all day
"Its a real shame that WWE released Punk around this time, would've loved to see him on team Cena."
Rollins defently paid the referee I mean if I would be the ref I would disqualify Seth
25:49 the betrayal of big show to team cena
Jiggler ke pit pe chura GOP ne vala big show kyuki unki madat karne ki bajeya cena or apni puri team ko dhoka de gyaa jiggler ki madat karni cheya thi dhoka de gyaa dogala saala
Lets go. John cena
"In a perfect world, 
Ryback realises what opportunities he has got and is grateful and works on his in ring safety. 

Rusev gets good storylines.

Wyatt family never gets dissolved.

Ziggler gets consistent pushes.

Kane is THE DEMON KANE."
Dog hammer Triple H
I hate Hammer Triple H so much .He often dirty brows to opponent  to get a win
Dolph has so much pains to fight with dirty team and he try to defeat dirty team to get a win for his team . Thank you Dolph  so much for his fighting
"This is dirty match .inside dirty Triple H .Big  show is vile man  ,he negotiates with enemy ( Opponent) is not good for team"
Undertaker make  fair
"Beat dirty Triple H  until he died 
Call dirty Humber Triple H"
Please beat dirty Triple H to help your team
Team John fight With dirty team and has dirty Triple H
Team Authority is dirty team
John cena oppostite team cheats a lot
Mojaa
Golden era when WWE used to be the best
worst crowd ever
what an amazing survivor series
Who else was waiting for someone that got eliminated on cena and Stephanie was bragging and they wanted someone to say do you ever shut up or cena aa her
"Ha,"
is Dolph Ziegler a man???? i doubt as he is a man. how he is strong??? this is the best wrestling  i ever seen.
Dolph Ziggler is the last man standing
the team authority is cheeter and @#!*
Never trust big show
Nxt has freedom because of shawn Michaels run for nxt
Good geme very nice
3:32 i love how Cole is talking about how mad Triple H got while he's setting right there and Jerry is just laughing at it
Bravo
This is one of the dolpha best performance
"The amount of ads with WWE youtube videos has gotten out of hand.  I have given up trying to watch them.   Bye, bye WWE"
Die alte is so penlich

Take a shot whenever Dolph impressed you
Now there is no more Dolph Ziggler now WWE has lost iconic
Big show is a traitor
Oopoo

Dolph zigller and sting best and bestest of all in this
the zigzag dif rollins 5 min after it was hit for anyone that says that finisher sucked
"Years later, I'm crying again"
28:00 dolph is alone. 1vs100000 yes not joke

Match start
WHAT A MATCH IN THE HISTORY OF WWE. DOLPH ZIZZLER IS A WORLD SUPERSTAR
Besides 2005 this is the best survivor series match of all time
Stings return was so overshadowed by his God awful booking.... they brought him back to do nothing but lose...
All planned no doubt
They did henry dirty with that elimination
why is there an ad every 15 seconds? doesn't WWE make enough money
Like for  DZ for stunning performance
Best Match
"Sting just saved everything. We love u Sting.

And good job Dolph Ziggler. Your performance was outstanding."
So
"What a porpomence
Great hats of"
Quien fue el ganador
38:03 that could have been 3 bc the refs arm was down lol but this is entertaining
Yu pikk
Nice try it is 3 vs 1 but you won
Sosal MD I wwe speak view the most emotions $
What a script
1:19 MOST REPLAYED
I love how Sting joining Team Cena
It's crazy too think Dolph was this good.
Bhaiya aur add dalna tha

Ngn curang an itu menang itu tim cena
At 30:59 the way Eric Rowan land on his knees is insane.
Rip Luke Harper
Uf
"If the the WCW alliance had sting, Goldberg, Ric flair, lex luger and booker t as team at survivor series 2001. WCW probably would have had a chance"
WCW died in survivor series 2001. Sting bought the WCW spirit back at survivor series 2014 just for a brief second
Vince McMahon thought Stephanie and Shane the key to win and make WWE 1# in the wrestling business and he thought triple H the same thing
Dolph Ziggler is similar to HBK.
Seth Rollins should give Dolph Ziggler a word heavyweight championship match
i always found it funny that rusev was branded as a russian for 3+ years while having a tattoo on his shoulder of bulgaria
Team authority was cheated
Nice dolp Ziggler
Cool
I wish Ziggler was pushed more
They are damn cheaters but triple H him his him
Xxx oru potta
i love this match so much
Apart from the delayed final pin and too much unnecessary staredown between Triple H and Sting this is by far the Survivor Series match of all time. An instant classic.
This was the end of decent wwe material
The Wyatt family guys were terrible in the ring
Dolph jiggler best perfomence

Very bad big show
9 years ago but still gives goosbumps
big snow strong
this match Dolph Ziggler performence>>>>>>>>>>his career.
no  matter how many times you watch this this never gets old
Big show is the worst in the team
The best ending with Scorpio and  dolph
This is Dolph zinglers best performance because 3 v  1 against authority
They greatly underestimated Dolph in this match. I'm sure we all were thinking Cena would be the one to defy the odds by himself but they gave Dolph the chance. Shame he wasn't pushed more in WWE.
3clss
Assa hogaya app jietgaya
"Big show got fear and ran away, , small man played very well"

"This is the best match ever, I remember watch this live and the high was too real, CM punk vs Undertaker is the second best."
Pink sweet 2:15
Wikso is looser looser
Ggdhsh
I miss the authority
"dolzyggler,, is the best set rolling"
Havent watched since it was called WWF the level went down so bad.
"Great storytelling. Watching this 9 years later, and no Survivor Series had topped this since."
Actually I hate that ladies
gonna like all the comments so it remind those ppl about this masterpiece
The best thing ever in Survivor Series 5 on 5 match
Big show kinda ruined it for me
"big show:you are so ugly
black man:lets go i defeat you
big show:huh! are you sure
black man:ahh! ahh!!
big show:ummm one tap"
yeeess
Dop is tha best
This super fight
The glorious moment of wwe
No interest
"The beginning of the legend of Dolph Ziggler as the best seller and jobber of WWE, also if that was the best run of Dolph like a baby face."
Big so is bad man

Fake wrestling

This the best match all time in wwe history and dolph zigglar is one of the greatest superstar in wwe
Team cheater defeated.
"Seth Rolling, always a big cheater in the ring."
"If this was for publicity purposes then they achieved it! But, if this was for real then I have No Respect for Triple H at all! Dolph Ziggler is an amazing athlete and human being in my opinion! To see Sting even the consequences was a real show stopper! This is wrestling at it's finest..."
My man didn't give up till the last despite of such severe injuries
Poor Mark Henry... didn't deserve to be punched in the face and eliminated by the Big Show!
Ziggler with the single greatest athletic performance of all time
Legend on big show
Dolph Ziggler is the is the guy
That man  seth was sleep win sting interfered
Team cenaaaa
Dolph deserved every bit of this. He's always been world class and underappreciated.
Nice performance jigler
"For history, dolph"
Dolph was from other universe
Did Seth rollins tag himself in? 1:54
GREATEST MATCH IN THE DECADE.
One of greatest matches i ever watched
1:33 when you drink too much coffee and then anxiety comes
Dolphin Ziggler did so well
27 min to 44 min.. master class by Dolph
Can't believe that it was dolph.....however triple h always has been a cheater.
"In the head of Dolph Ziggler: BUT IM STILL STANDING AFTER ALL THIS TIME, FEELING LIKE A TRUE SURVIVOR"
"Dolph ziggler outstanding match of all time, Love you"
Dolph is one man army
I kept watching just because my brother said ziggler was going to win
why does big show do that?
Always liked Ziggler. I hated and it was a shame when they made him get beaten up again and again by Corbin after Corbin's debut.
My favourte is yoko suns
Dolph Ziggler best
Wow ziggler
Ziggler goood
Too bad that we'll never be able to see luke harper again he was a great wrestler indeed
One of the greatest WWE match to have ever played

"Dolph being under used by wwe. If cody deserves to be wwe champion, then dolph should be too. To be honest, he is a championship material."
The biggest match of Dolph Ziggler
Cheater
Team aturity cheater
17:40
the authoritarian ISO a lot of cheating
that's cheating
An underated legend .
It might just be me but when Sting came I was wondering if Seth and Dolph accidentally passed out for a bit during that or the were just so exhausted they didn't want to move
Ziggler is pentestick lot's of love from Assam India bodoland

The big guy is a machine miss seeing ryback on wwe honestly feels to quiet without him bring back ryback.
The one man show
Just for the record Dolph had Rollins pinned 6-7 times(if you count the one with sting). And from those pins Rollins kicked out only 3 just imagine how good was prime Dolph
This was epic Dolph is legendary

Dolph ziggler best performance ooo my god is legend
Doph ziggler is better than roman Reigns
Triple H not an wrestler just a cheeter
Team authority knows cheeting only otherwise first 5 mint is enough for them to loose
Bro zigler did everything he took the hits sacrificed himself and then he carried the team like what?? Overall he's the best
MY BEST MATCH EVER

BIGSHOW IS CHEATER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I think its funny how Seth tagged Mark Henry right before he got KO'ed
Ziggler for me is so complicated. As i believe his wrestling style suits a face. But he only seems comftable on a mic when his heel.
Wtf
31:16 what is Stephanie talking about?
9yrs later and I'm back to watch this masterpiece
Show Roman Reigns this and tell him that this is the real God Mode. Ziggler ruled that night.

"Lol triple H has always been one of the best at making facial expressions whether funny or serious ones..

referring to his face after big show got the pinfall in the beginning. So subtle and simple but great lol"
Dolph ziggler is so under rated truly one of the goats
Its the same match team raw vs team smackdown back in 2005 but Dolf instead of HBK
I honesty expected more from Mark Henry
Boy Show is happy
"If this was Stings only appearance in WWE, it would have been perfect. I don't think his time in WWE was a complete disaster but there wouldn't have been any problem with this being his only appearance."
Lie
Imagine 2001 lane in this match
no matter who or how many times they won wwe there is only one Vigilante and his name is Sting the best wrestler ever
