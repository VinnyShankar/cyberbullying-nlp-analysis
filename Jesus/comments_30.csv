Prove it slapped a split in your skull guns stolen from them guards quickly suicide squad
"As bad as the movie was, this scene was incredible good"
Deadshot
What's stopping me
ws can scrw himself for all i care
o block's finest
Honestly i think the rounds were more powerful which is whyyy he was so shocked
ayo the subtitles counting shots lmao
"Terrible movie, but this scene was badass."
"i think deadshot would have actually shot the guy in the face had Amanda not said anything. you can see him at 1:17 hearing that and thinking, ""maybe these are live rounds"" and so he shoots up in the air to test it"
By far the best scene of that  boring movie
i known you like nine months lol
nagawa na lahat ng FERNANDO POE...HAHAHA
I don't think he has permission from Jada to play with guns like that.
Movie name
why does this have so many views
"""I need u to white people that thing. You know how y'all do?"""
Pour one out for whoever got hit by that first shot into the air.
To think that such a great actor got his balls taken by his wife
He plays a lot of cod
this guy done subtitled the gunshots and the reload. someone give this man a raise
"Keep the live bullets, out ya f**kin gun!"
What in the name of aimbot is this?
Whats the title of this movie
Its loaded.
"Got one in the chamber. Whatchu gon do with it?

Deadshot: points gun at Chris Rock"
Name of the movie please
"""yeeeeee, Fortnite"""
"Dunno if it's been mentioned, but turn on CC when he starts shootin'"
Will Smith owned that role
Will Smith was the reason i never watched this movie
"Let's concede Deadshot is some type of mutant with the ability to manipulate telekinetically, to some extent, high velocity tiny objects to improve his aim to be more precise. Possibly triggered by the smell of gun powder given his reaction after firing the first shot in the air."
""" Darnell's Out """
Dude can also slap short black men if agitated.
Enemies when I play games:
Will female bicth baby will. Hit you not for alswer
"recoil dont work like that, no skill can negate it."
Lame.
What a piece of shit movie this was
"Never missed a ""slap""."
"I always love how no one ever winces or flinches around fully automatic fire with no ear protection in movies. I get it its a movie, but my brain always points it out lol"
"movie  name, anyone tell me"
"Him and diablo, hands down, best characters."
Joel deserves and Oscar for keeping his laughter in as best he could when Will was listing his demands.
WHITE!!!
NOW U KNOW DEADSHOT GONNA MAKE A BULLET COUNT IN THE APOCALYPSE
"One of the best character introduction ngl. The seriousness, the tensity, the comedy are all there. F DC man... Deadshot definitely needs a standalone movie."
FULL MOVIE
This vids probably made more $ for DC than the flash movie lol
Typical Hollywood shit show. The real world? No way.
What is the naam of the movie?
Deadshot saved this movie from getting a 2 out of 10 on IMDb
1:26 dude shot a bird
His not talking his talking to whom.
white people that sht was funny but so true.
physically not possible but fun.
It's all started when he shoots an alien girl standee
The only person more excited than Deadshot about firearms is the subtitlist.
aimhack
My wife's!  name!..
Song name anyone??
"True deadshot wouldve killed them by ricocheting bullets ,  and use enemies guns to escape successfully. he didnt probably Amanda Wahler threatened him using his daughter."
Aimbot activated:
Steel targets dont spark and they dont melt holes through them - movie is absolutely rubbish
Timeless
I love how the only price he gave for himself was to be free and everything else was for his daughter including her custody so he can take care her himself.
"i did love will smith, but i lost his cool when he slapped Chris"
Deadshot vs Bloodsport. Who wins?
"Hands down, best part of the whole movie!"
Bella vita eh? Sinatra
bro called himself lazy in the captions but gave us the exact name of the guns floyd was using lmaooo youve done more than enough thank you
THIS guys wife cheated on him
"Gotta say, I didn't like much of the DCEU. But this is easily one of my favorite scenes"
I thought this was Hancock for the longest time
cringiest shit ever lmao
suprised he didnt know by the weight that bullets were in there
Why can't we get sound design like that in our fps shooters )':
As bad as the movie was this scene and El Diablos transformation part were two of the best scenes I've ever seen
you should stop trying to be a comedian  asyou would probably laugh if somebody was taking the piss out of your wife like all real men do
this is literally the quiet kid if u bring him to a gun range
"The last round, he shot 55 bullets. M E N A C E of a hitman"
"Wow, Hollywood propaganda is getting worse and worse."
More like Wagner Squad
such a trash film
what do he mean with ''white people that'' when he talk about school and stuff at 2:57 ?
The dumbest line in this scene is Amanda trying to randomly convince him to shoot the guy.. dumb and horrible writing. What was her motivation?
This is my CSGO AIM !!
"Overall, I did not like this film at all, but I really liked Will Smith, Marot Robbie, Joel Kinnaman, and Viola Davis in their roles. It is a pity that they didn't bother with ANY prequels to lay the foundation for this film so that we don't spend nearly an hour in backstory hell."
Glowbitches wet dream
All you gonna be when you die is spray paint on the ground.
"My account got hacked.
Looks like my dad 
Best be a chairleader"
Shouldn't infamous hitman have been able to tell the difference in weight between a gun full of blank or live rounds?
legends says he swallowed a USB Aimbot
gun shooting got subtitles (cc) too 
Cuck Smith
Thanks Viola davis for making the most badass woman in fiction come to life.
The moive name pls
"love the small details here, deadshot is shooting/aiming with both eyes open, this is a much more effective method of aiming in combat scenarios but incredibly difficult to master, showing deadshot's extreme familiarity with shooting and firearms in general"
Name of movie?
Willsmith for a villain are more than interesring
Will was pretending they were all the little boys that bang his wife
deadshot super power is he has no recoil lol
"""If my daughter is not cutting it, white people that sh!t"" thank you Lori Loughlin."
Holy shit has no one talked about how this channel put closed captions on the guns and how many bullets he shot what a fucking legend
Legend says his wife gave him that look
aimbol
best scene of that movie
My guy has aimbot
Not to be nit-picky but he shot the gun at 1:28 and missed... just saying
"Yup, just as terrible today as it was when it came out. 
Bad writing, bad acting, bad directing, bad movie. Whoever made it should feel bad. I hope someday DC figures out how to make a decent live action movie, until then at least they can manage good animated flicks."
Martyyyy
everyone in that room has permanent hearing damage now
will smith pretends hes not SOY GREAT sCENE
"No recoil [On]
No spread [On]
Aimbot [On]
Aimhead [On]"
I thought Deadshot was white.
Still couldn't kill The Detective.
when u use aimbot
apparently he is better at slapping than shooting
Will smith the best ever
Weak ass man get off my screen
My God this is beyond cringe.....
"Love when Rick and his men witness Deadshot shoots the target and realize he entirely lives up to his reputation, feels like they're struggling to not cry."
The russian guy in the enemy team when playing any FPS game:
The look on Flagg's and Waller's faces when then realize he's all they say he is. Priceless.
https://youtube.com/shorts/rFs_dZoTAWc
love how nobody is wearing any ear protection
Turn on the subtitles for best experience
Deadshot would be a perfect survivor in the Zombie Apocalypse.
Yall joker's must me crazy is one of best lines from dead shot
I think I have a doo doo
"Don't care what the movie elitists say, the first suicide squad was an absolute joy ride."
The closed caption for this video is severely underappreciated.
He use chlorophyte bullet
Criminal we know things Son hahaha
Bro was worried about his browser history than national security
1:36 what song is this?
The greatest movie of all time
"Nah, John Wick has better handling."
1000pcs
"They ended up taking this bit out of the final cut, but after this scene ends he slaps the guy."
With captions on it shows the gun specs
"He deserved a solo deadshot movie, but these American idiots didn't have taste."
Just saying deadshots daughter may have saved the batman not her daddy that night
notice how deadshot says jokers to imply they are crazy like da joker baby
This would be awesome if it wasnt Will Smith
What a loving father. I'm sure he's in prison because of tax evasion or something non-violent like that
I will never forgive this movie for giving us this scene and not a scene showing the confirmed sniper kill the film mentioned
I know it's old but you just can't help but watch how Deadshot had no point deviation.
"""Ames, if this man shoots me... I want you to kill him... And I want you to go clear my browser history.""    -Griggs 2016"
"Waller may have been portrayed as a villain for her lack of empathy and ruthless tactics in most of her encarnations but in the end she just wanted to save the world no matter what, even if it meant killing anyone to do it"
"He said he wanted him to white people that thing you know how yall do. But he claims he was talking to his boss, the black woman. The person he claims he was talking to but wasn't looking at, yet was reacting to the white dudes words.

Ya, ok. Did nobody read this script or watch this scene after it was filmed?"
slap
"Telling them to ""stand down"" is an idiotic thing to do IMO, this way you have no way to kill him. It would be awesome though that when he shot the test shot e.g. a bird would go down next to them hehehe"
"""Ima need you to white people that shit""  . . . . yeah like we did with all those low GPA scores . . . .NO LONGER . . . ha ha ha ha ha"
Amanda Waller gives the bats chills. I love it
Soldier dude makes a very good point at the end of the clip
Only good scene in the movie.
"Tbh, not that expensive considering."
"That ""browser history"" joke was them trying to be funny, but it's so misplaced that it's cringy as fuck"
The cc person writing the cc let us into their inner thoughts.
best part of the whole movie. love how he's not going full auto and i love the unnecessary canting of the gun lol
They said one in the chamber and then he proceeds to fire like 8 rounds with each
the dvd has uncensored slaps moments
"God, I hate some people... Everybody's all ""HUR HUR, IT SLAP MAN"" like it isn't an overused 'joke' based on someone who openly defended his chronically ill wife, was then divorced by said wife, and is now humiliated because he was just trying to be a good person.

Anywho, with that out of the way... I'd say that- skin tone aside- Will Smith's take on good ol' Floyd Lawton is a fantastic portrayal. I love that the kept the idea that he was a father first, and a merc second. Because, I mean... He is. It's what I like about his character the most."
"Man they want Waller to sound like some dangerous woman so bad! It's sad because, she's only dangerous because the protagonists don't stoop down to her level. If they did, she couldn't do a damned thing."
"Despite what happened at the Academy Awards, Will smith is undoubtedly still one of the best actors."
"""Oh you think I'm talking to you?""
""You're about 2 inches away from my face, yes I do"""
"""i gave you a cookie... That was a good cookie, wasnt it!?!"""
Why did the lady try to say the bullets were dummy rounds
Anybody know the make and model of the rifle Will Smith is firing at the end of the demo?
The English subtitles are GLORIOUS
0:58 Ha.
thats a papa
This scene would have been 1000 times more interesting if he did a trick shot at the end and killed Griggs. They need his skills so they can't kill him for it.
He's a microsurgeon with those guns!
Dated june 27 2023.
thank you for including the gun info in the captions.
"Yes, a deadly hitman doesnt know the weight of a loaded gun vs empty"
Will sleeps on the entanglement's wetspot so Jada doesn't have to. And he's right there with kleenex whenever Jada finishes.
I like how he sniffs the gun after he fired it for the first time.
what movie is this
It's been 6 years already. Damn.
1:24 imagine if their was just some random dude walking and sees a bird just fall down on car.
Flag and Deadshot were the best part of this movie
The most underrated movie of all time.
If he ever runs out of smacks. This is what he can do with bullets
ally 1:00
#ReleaseTheAyerCut
For me this suicide squad is better.
That was hawt.
"Honestly from this clip I thought Deadshot was a low-level telekinetic, really just able to keep the trajectory of his bullets moving exactly where he wants with extreme precision but nothing crazier than that"
Slap joke
""
"When deadshot smells the chamber, he almost flags Amanda. You can see her slightly move out of the way. Funny to see that actors still move out of the way, even though the gun is obviously fake."
I like how he disses the the white guy for having a female boss when you know Jada wears the pants in that family.
Das move is shittttt
"As shit as this movie was, will smith was an awesome deadshot"
And he won't miss the slap
He probably talked about his wife
For my gun fanatics; what is the first pistol he picked up?
Remember folks switching to your slap is faster than reloading
What a bs movie. My God
Keep my guns name.. out your fkin mouth
Bloody shame what he did at the Academy Awards as I loved him in this movie.
he better keep her name outta his mouth or else..whammo
Scary shot
"if that browser history line was removed, this would actually be a decent scene"
"I love how Flag says, ""Darnell's out"""
And then everyone went deaf because none of them were wearing ear pro.
Dumb movie
"To bad we will never see him back as Deadshot. Will Smith owned the role. How can you bring back Amanda Waller, but not Deadshot?"
"A viewer and a fan
157M views from 6years
1.2M likes
A much profit"
Definitely proves government is not your friend
Such a missed opportunity. There should be a whole movie dedicated to Deadshot.
How can 1 of the best scenes of any movie be in such a mediocre movie you asked?? Will Smith. I want this Deadshot back.
"When Will Smith wants to look angry on set, he just imagines which one of his son's friends is up in his wives guts."
"The thing is, in reality, the government would hire him and make him filthy rich. Not the suicide squad, lmao, no."
Movie name?
"Why play a sniper there Smith ?? 
Even though Anderson threatens me with being snipered , 
That's just terrist threats by a viscous circle  .


Someone should ACTUALY cloth that depiction of children don't you think .

Oh wait MABY it's just FUNNY to you people"
"Hay Cyrus how's Thor , I mean Hemsworth and men in black ??? 

Oh that's just night time camo , 
How many of you were there in that vehicle , when it's all of you all ."
"Current sniper threats tied to guardian angels and the serpent and rainbow ...


G that Russian sniper rifle is taller than you 

Cyrus .
 So Thor owns the tragic lights 
Which bear you people's sniper marks isn't funny to me . Stefani"
His aim is accurate even without a gun
"No shade on Viola Davis' acting chops, she's got the attitude and swagger to play Amanda Waller, but she doesn't have the figure. Every other portrayal of Ms Waller has been a very plus-size woman, like 55+ inch waist line plus-size. To put it bluntly, the character is a fat bully with a paranoid America-centric agenda."
"This video slaps, will smith what do you think?"
DEADSLAPP
To everyone that doesnt know. Thats not how all those bulle holes will look like if they pierced the steel target.
"No offense, but those guns can't do that.  Even if you had a vice holding the gun and the gun was in a fixed position, there would be some spread in the shots.  Even the bullets aren't exactly identical.  In addition, the targets had to have been set up to not have any give, which is very dangerous for ricochet reasons--they should have some give to them so the bullet would bounce off and away... otherwise those bullets or their fragments could ricochet back towards you."
"See how even when he is convinced the gun doesn't have actual bullets he pratices gun safety. More people should do this, wink wink alec baldwin"
Name of this movie please
"Why did he point the gun at the security guard? If he suspected the firing pin was filed down, couldn't he have just tested it down range?"
Technically he missed
"As an avid shooter, I like that the writers (or maybe just Will) put time into filming proper shooting technique. Good grips, practical engagement stance, good reloads overall. I like it"
I think wil smith is a real hero compared to actual soldiers on the battlefield.
the thumbnails been in my news feed for years
"As much as I love this scene, and I do love this scene and I actually listen to this song when I'm at the range often, I know good and well none of them would be able to hear after all of those rounds being fired. lol"
now?
No lores other boss female man woman bich
Kids bogman daddy above
"I really like Flag. He's like the only one with sense and logic in this entire movie, and he speaks what everyone is thinking."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQI_W1O8skY
What a shot film
If he never misses where'd that first bullet go?
White
1:00
Here you can see the best character killed off in second movie... that's all.
for someone who is an expert in weapons how does he not know there is a bullet in the chamber
Aimbot hack be like:
Awesome movie
It's a shame Deadshot wasn't in the second Suicide Squad. He hurt his back carrying everyone in the first one.
You have to give Joel Kinnamen credit here. For him to go toe to toe with stars with screen presence like Will Smith and Margot Robbie and hold his own with them is a feat worthy of mentioning.
Say what you want but this fucken badass
"""That how i roll"""
#Nevermissashot
That whiff must have been magical for him lol
I love how the second he realizes the rounds are live he not only checks by smelling and clearing the chamber but he essentially smokes the gunpowder and immediately just starts letting it rip with the 1911. Sick ass accurate scene.
Will Smith single-handedly made this movie watchable.  No pun intended
"""I want you to kill him.. and I want you to clear my browser history"""
"Whenever my co-worker wants me to proof read an email he's sending he tell me he needs me ""to 'white people' that thing up""! Hahaha............"
turn on captions its pretty cool
Love it when he snorts the smoke out of the pistol like it's a line of coke.
2:15 lmao captions
This is one of my all time favorite scenes in a movie. I love it!!!
movie was trash this scene good
MF has recoil scripts downloaded
Bro had that Warzone 2 recoil
"""BrO hE Is HaCkInG"""
Man I really wish that Will Smith played Deadshot again in the sequel.
I love this opening scene so much. Gives me such nostalgia to the 80's
This is basicly how literally everyone hits their target except for will when Jada gets horny and fucks some lowlife in front of her cuck husband
Pursuit of happiness 2
Afro samurai
I'm have to check this movie out. Thanks for the heads up
Movie name???
I guess he missed his first shot then.
Oh get over the slap bullshit
"Will Smith is the king of acting, HANDS DOWN"
If your daughter's grades start slipping and she is black im pretty sure it diesnt matter.
"At first i thought this was acting, then i found out his wife was a psychopath. 
Now this all makes sense."
"will smith as deadshot, margot robbie as harley quinn, and jai courtney as captain boomerang were the only good things to happen to this movie, and i wish we wouldve gotten more will smith as deadshot. they need to bring him back for like a tv show on hbo max or something, it might be what his career needs to revive it."
I don't want any compliments in my videos.
How everyone was impressed of Deadshots skills and they be like they  know they ain't gonna ever be that good at shooting
sad how he used worse language in an emmy crowd than a 'blockbuster' movie..
John wick is the best
"f-ing racist. nobody around here has any ""white people that thing"" just very hard work. Blacks just do not want to work. All they want is government support. 3 times I was told I was the wrong color for the job, restaurant in Ky 74, US Forest Service Ca 90's, and the city is Santa Barbera told me I need to be black to be hired. It is an advantage being black, not white but that is the real world."
It's his fight or flight impulse that he was concerned about.
This will smith guy is going to go to jail.
You should see his aim if you don't keep his wife's name out your motherf***ing mouth!
Name song?
Full movie kaha hai bro
The price was to keep his wife name out your mouth
Freakin Aimbot
the problem with this scene is how he holds the gun....it's obviously wrong you need to bend your elbows for the recoil...you learn that in filmmaking year 1
"That b*tch said ANTISOCIAL and not ASOCIAL.
My man!"
What's the name of this movie
2:10 I just love how he uses the iron sight too.
Name of movie please???
"If you open the subtitles, at 1:40 the editor literally counted all the bullets for each round for each gun :3"
"lmaoooo ""I'm lazy af. he fired arround & until 40-50"""
What is the name of this song in this scene?
The subtitles are legendary
fun fact the first gun gas a 10 round mag. He shot one to the air and 10 at the targets
"""And i want you to go clear my browser history"" LITERALLY ME IF IM EVER ON DEATH ROW MAN LMFAO"
"Cringe, the movie"
"""I'm lazy AF"" says the guy who went to the trouble to count all the shots and name the gun and ammo types. In case-correct letters."
No need for guns just start slapping ppl
"Damn, that cuck can shoot..."
1:26
Name of the side scope?
Hate that nigg Will Smith
"Lesson learned, never hire the cuck Will Smith if you want a continuation of movies."
That dock was never once attacked in WW2
3:27 He could play a good arrow. He looks like the one in injustice
Daaaamn did a texan subtitled this????
This is the number one scene i got back to in this movie. Simply cause of how well it's all done. I wish the whole movie had the same tone.
"""I need you to white people thay thing"" ugh. Dumb"
Subtitles are the best part lol
its weird everyone is soaking wet except for the female
TBH he just missed his first shot?
"He also is well known for his close combat skills, specifically using the palm of his hand."
1:40 - Alec Baldwin when he shows up on set.
Wats the name of movie
This version of Deadshot is definitely a meta human.
Name movi
"As bad as this movie is, fuck this is a incredible scene"
Beta/simp smith
bro just putted on aim assist lmao whahha
Did anyone see those subtitles fucking hell
Finger on trigger at all times. Blinks every shot. He aint shit
THIS WOMAN ENT NO DUNCAN MC CLOUD THOUGH SOOOOOO WHY SUMBODY ENT SORT HER OUT YET!!! PER THE ORIGINAL COMIC\CARTOON JUST WHAT HAPPENED
What is that movie called
Robocop style. :)
For anyone who needs the movie name - Suicide squad
"If this man shoots me, I want you to kill him, and I want you to go clear my browser history"
almost as good as hicock45
His last wish is to delete his browser history
0:03 best table decor ever.
Imagine if Deadshot & John Wick teamed up
"Deadshot: *Points at Griggs with gun*
Griggs: Go clear my browser history"
Baba yaga taught him to shoot lyk dat.
The scene where I got my ign(in game name) from!!
"I'm uploading the browser history got it 
That"
He goes for the 1911 first. Brilliant.
Bananas in Pajamas I'm coming down the stairs
Aimbot
the only good scene in this movie
Dude literally asked to clear his browser history salute
Kind of disappointing they used nazi music during the shooting scene.
Glad to know that one in this world does not have his precision.
Isn't will Smith a b*txh irl  ? Hard to enjoy a movie played by a cuck
He's better than Alec Baldwin
Will smith and Margot Robbie basically carried this movie and prevented it from being okay to quite good
song namee
I wonder if will Smith had 2 take gun lessons
"Flagg and the other guy are H- O-T! HOT,HOT,HOT!!!"
I don't watch movies with sir cucksalot anymore
"As soon as he steped out that prison gate, Dethstrok has that same face i made. You wanted me in here, have fun where your going. I might not drive, So I had to walk to prison that day."
1:01 i would say that too
156 m views so far.  Will is a draw. Not to mention the other leads.
wall hack!!!!!!!!
I still want a Deadshot movie with Will Smith. Or at least return in another Suicide Squad movie as a lead.
We need a Deadshot movie.
I fuckin hate will smiff.
Another comment about the subtitles. They are absolutely amazing.
Underrated movie bro. I give it a 8/10. I personally enjoyed it. I loved seeing these new villains team up and make funny jokes.
Movie name please
"""Ames, If this man shoots me. I want you to kill him... Then clear my browser history.""
What was bro looking up?"
cringe
What is this song in the background
https://youtube.com/@Action-tv-lmn-iq5fz
Will Smith is so good is in this movie that all other actors were actually dragging him down. I mean the movie could have been just him it would have made a difference.
.45. Cuz 9 mm is gay
dork
"Id like to point out, when he sniffed his gun, the barrel is pointed at the lady."
Dead shot and blood sport should have been together
This scene pisses me off as a gun nerd but none the less I enjoyed it.
"""Get my wifes gun out your f****** shooting range"""
Gotta love sparks from lead bullets. Amazing !!
I need you now
thats cool
"Hi, I get some clip from your video. Thanks a lot men"
song name
Keep my daughters name out your F***** MOUTH!
who yall got john wick vs Deadshot in a shootout?
"From slapping other comedians, he was able to have firm hands and wrists."
He just got a better gaming chair
John Wick Laughing
I love how you know a movie sucks when every youtube comment just points out what the scene is literally about on the surface level.
Those Hollywood sparking bullets
hes using a cronus
he should change his name to aim bot
"Poor casting choice, will smith will only becomes him, even i dont see deathstroke in it"
Straight shot to face really good
This is SOOOO CRINGE
aimbot.exe
slapshot
RAPORT AIM BOT
"he went 8 rounds with the 1911
while it could only got 7"
There will be two people working in the field..one taken...one left...there will be two working at the mill...one taken...the other left.
1:25
Which movie is it ???
movie name
the only thing illegal in this video is the pistol brace :)
Me randomly turn on captions and there is narrative on each gun (except the 1st one i think). Thanks for the info.
2 cancelled black guys in one clip. Didn't see that one coming
Been shooting steel for years. I've never seen a bullet throw a spark.
These subtitles never missed a shot either
This nibba is angry
Little did Will know Darnell was also sleeping with his wife irl.
white people dat thang
ace is solid
"Psychotic was just a term named after the ones who came up with the adhd and the lgbtq agenda. 
          We had nothing to do with it. Until you all propagate it into nonsense."
Oh The Deaf Squad
"""Darnell's out"""
What is the title of this movie
Love will smith in this scene
Deadshot is my 2nd favorite villain.
yo daniels out
Kotte animation has great parody for the same
Mfers ignore the fact that Joel played a perfect Richard Rogers Flag Jr.
"If i die , remember to clear my browser history"
That's Will Smith real live firing yo
Range Shooters
Should have done Independence Day 2 instead of this
Of all of them Waller is the biggest sociopath
Black people are awesome
Dead shot should get his own show on hbo max
What is the movie called
Were the targets saying something about his wife??
Lookin like the mayor of Chicago out there bargaining with the greatest sniper ever
Nice No Recoil Tarkov CHEAT
"The sooner Amanda Waller is dead as Malcolm X, the better. Even if she was shot right between the eyes."
Why tf is the caption so specific
Why is no one wearing ear protection
Where can we learn to shoot like that?
The browser history was deleted after all?
trash captions
Only deadshot can get 155M views
"Honestly for the mission he was going for, his conditions weren't THAT bad excluding the 1st one as he'd go back to killing people. Had he just asked for his daughter's things I don't think Flagg wouldn't have thought poorly of him or made jokes about his price"
THEY SAID MY NAME
Hi
Can someone tell me why she would lie about the rounds being real? What exactly does she gain lmao?
"this wouldve been a great movie if they didn't marvel it up. DC it's ok to make a series movie based on comic book characters, see the entire dark knight trilogy THAT YOU FUCKING MADE!!!"
"Great wrist muscles comes from slapping people left and right... 
Plus watching his wife with other guys, gives him enough time to practice his ""wrist"" muscles!"
Slappity Slap Slap!!!
No one was writing things down because they were all deaf.
Will was just picturing each target as Jada.
No spray and No recoil = ON
Does anyone where to learn how to shoot a Gun hahaha
"Smith is one of the top worst actors of all time , should not even be considered as an actor he sucks period"
They left out the part where he slaps all the black people for not keeping his wife's name out they f#ckin mout!
He black
The browser history line is so cringe.
Darnells out
only scene from this movie I liked lmao
"weapon reecoil be like: ""aight, imma head out!"""
What is the name of this movi if I want to whatch it on netflix
Nobody I know can shoot that accurate. Not even Jerry Miculek.
bro has aimbot
The same guy will really get scared when uncle phil is around
Hahahahaa the boss
Move nema
Just imagine your targets are Chris Rock and the rest is easy...
"Out of curiosity though:

Deadshot vs John Wick- who wins?"
How the fuck is will smith so much cooler here than he is in real life
"what bothers me from this scene is when he says ""dummy rounds"" I'm like he is a weapons expert and can clearly see the top bullet is not a blank lol"
what is the name of the film
Man has got aimbot
I wanna know what was in dudes browser history lol
Best scene ever
"I've always liked this movie. I thought it introduced the characters very straight forward, and to the point. 
The plot yeah I can see why ppl hated it, but I feel it would've made a better movie if it took place in between man of steel and BvS instead of after BvS. I also REALLY liked Will Smith as Deadshot, I feel he gets WAY to much hate for this role. Him and Margaret, El diablo and even Cpt.boomerang carried this movie. My favorite part is from the Bar scene to the ending."
Hancock in an Alternate Universe
the day when deadshot dont forgot is aimbot
Zero respect for will Smith
UFO
Am I the only who thinks this scene is kinda awful?
My only real problem with the movie is the jokers personality (doesn't feel right but I like that he treats Harley better) and that yelling bit with Will at the end(thats been overdone and it was just out of place to me) but I did enjoy the movie it had a lot of heart and ended nice-ish but this scene was just awesome to me
"wow amazing views

"US 2022: 40,000 deaths and 80,000 wounded using 528 million guns.  Approximately $557 billion per year."
Did DC seriously thought that remaking Suicide squad was a good idea...I mean come on.....we dont care about the camoes.....just give us the depth of the characters...like what this movie did.
Absolute bollocks.
deadshot never missed a slap
I kinda wanted Deadshot to be in the Sequel more than Bloodsport.
Aimbot cheater
"I always wondered what Flagg's team of ""pipe hitters"" would actually look like. He proved in Suicide Squad 2 that he was a good match for Peacemaker, I wonder if these Tier 1 units had any other similar skillsets in their ranks."
"so many great works and now his whole career is just defined by a slap. he didn't ruin his career but it damn well hurt his self-worth more than that slap will ever hurt Chris rock.

was recently watching clips from 'in pursuit of happiness' and people were just putting slap jokes instead of appreciating the great work."
The nazi soundtrack tho lol
Don't like this guy
Will Smith is really a good shot with guns in movies
I wanna see Deadshot vs Bullseye.
Will Smith is one of the best actors of all time! Haters gonna hate so Will Smith shouldn't care! I know I don't!
Bulletmancer.
"The soldier without mask smiling like, my god you will kill my boss.."
Deadslap?
wills and margots energy was great the only thing keeping me awake during this slog
Also maybe don't have one of your main characters literally explain why the whole concept of the movie makes no sense lol.
Ok but didn't they already know he could do this? Wasn't that the whole reason they wanted him on the Squad?? Why did they need a demomstration?? This movie with a crocodile man in it seems a bit unrealistic.
Nime please?
Art imitates life everyone knows that Will Smith is a hit man in real life as well
Iconic.
americans and guns...wow cool..not
"A part of me feels bad for Will Smith, he let his toxic, adulterous and oversharing wife force him to basically throw his career away."
This is what Will Smith becomes after Oscars fired him
Yeah true life!
I no longer respect will Smith
wait its could be point blank bullet for the first one how he know it s a real shoot
Honestly Harley Deadshot and Diablo were the most developed characters
How I can see full movie
Just keep your Hancock out of his wife's mouth
Anyone can tell me what is this movie name?
"""Delete my browser history"" jesus christ that dialouge is sht af"

Despite being an overly sensitive cuckold and being married to an overly dramatic narcissist... I still enjoy him in movies. I won't be paying to see him in anymore though
He really hits in the head

"Those people didnt let him do his ultimate move ""THE SLAP"""
AIMBOT
He only shoots people who are talking about his wife
What's the song that plays?
Interesting how this cuck get's manly roles from hollyweird when I real life he's just a cuck!!
"I'm gonna be honest: I absolutely despise this movie. It did so many things wrong. However, it also did a few things right, and two of those things were its portrayal of Deadshot (a few hiccups and his Will Smithisms aside) and its portrayal of Waller.

Both of those things are on perfect display in this clip."

man what a boring piece of crap ....
"Not how 3-round burst fire works in the slightest. Nice try, hollywood."
what is the title of the movie?
Can't show somebody drinking a beer during a beer commercial. But it's OK to show this in every movie regarding firearms use.
"You NEED to watch this with the CC on. Not only does the caption writer know their arms,  but at 2:14 admits they are ""Lazy AF"" and doesn't want to keep counting the rounds firing. Made me crack up."
This is how Big Willie let's off steam whenever Jada cheats on him.  That's why he's so good at it.
WILL SMITHY IS A LOW LIFE.WELL HATED?
"As much as I love this scene, the guns and the bullets they're firing are not that accurate. Variance in powder load, barrel temperature, and cycling would cause rounds to take different trajectories no matter how good the shooter. Also even with arms like a gorilla fully automatic fire would not stay on target like that. Still love it though!"
I just love how his first priority is his daughter
Whats his class i got the operator
"""First off you chose me. So you recognize the skills."""
What setup is he using on those guns? Must be a zero recoil build.

How a man can go from this to movie to a idiot assaulting another is just funny!!!! Spose he thought he was the man but in reality he is just a Knob
move name plz
Really the only thing that makes this totally fake is no one is wearing earphones but nice scene anyway.
They should've called him Slapshot.
Legend says he changed his name  to deafshot after firing all those rounds in a concrete echo chamber
"And yet he still hasn't gone up against chuck Norris. I mean chuck Norris already won either way. He probably fired his gun in the other direction, slapped him, and then killed hik"
will smith has alot of sex with alot of women :)
next we know he ditches the guns and slaps everyone
Will smith is a great person and he is great in every thing he is in and he is a great deadshot .The best deadshot

This scene absolutely slaps!
One guard is elon musk
Is that mayor of Chicago?! LMAO
I am guessing that cookie was good enough to spare him :D
Anybody read Steven King's The Dark Tower? Deadshot would make a hell of a Gunslinger! Roland would approve. But then again the last gunslinger always could haul a gun faster than any of his mates. Deadshot is accurate but would need to train to be faster.
"Holy shit so many views on this trash, hopefully people had gotten the clue
Lol."
"IMPOSSIBLE! Even if you had perfect aim, the recoil from the automatics would throw the shots off from the same hole a little bit!"

Excellent moment du film
What is name of this movie
I' am the Best Shooting  .
"10 shots out of a 1911
21 shots out of a glock 17 xD"
The most interesting thing is that Effrey Jeppstein didn't kill himself and we need to have a look at his guest list now
The song SUCKS!!!
The guard is probably the realist guy here.
"Man, i know they're rebooting the DC universe for good reasons but l really enjoyed this serious and grounded tone sometimes. It had something to it."
Totally impossible
"as shit as this movie was, the soundtrack was AMAZING"
Why not give him rubber bullets...
"I don't remember suicide squad coming out in 2016, I thought It came out later than that tbh."
"When he shot the sky, I guess he hit something since he never miss ? "
"dc is just turning into another rmarvel
waller is suppose to be a psycho that would kill anyone in the name of the country, underground part of the government, but now she's a female nick fury, watch black adam, she's giving orders to super heroes??"
This scene promotes gun violence Will Smith should have to pay the money to all victims of gun violence.
Hackers in warzone be like
He good
Stanky
"People don't understand how crazy deadshot is. Even surrounded by all those guards, a gun in his hand is all he needs to body them all in less shots than there are guards."
Should of had dead shot Vs Batman in a Batman movie then that movie Lead into Batman Vs Superman & into this movie
The fact Amanda Waller was egging him to shoot that guy says a lot about what she thinks about the guard.
Keanu Reeves would of been a better Deadshot then Will Smith. Will Smith acting in this movie was trash
Put subtitles on. And go to 2:15. Funny what they say
"FUk it, I'm watching suicide squad again."
I love that all he cares about is his daughter. A dangerous criminal but still a loving father at heart.
every person on enemy team on CSGO or Valorant:
Does anyone have an issue with Floyd firing 10 rounds out of the S&W 1911?  The standard mag only holds 7 rounds.  Ooops!
Squad ftw
goodbye eardrums
*Aimbot and No Recoil Mod detected.*
Boycott Will Smith. ALL. FOREVER.
Yo this scene slaps! I love it.
this scene realy shows off deadshot well he isn't a psychopath killing for fun he is a hitman if he shot the guard that very well might have thrown him right back in the cell he never planned to shoot the guard ultimately this was a job interview for him something he needed at that time
Whats the name of the song?
"Oh! Am sorry, you taught I was talking to you, I was talking to your Boss"

DARNELLS OUT
i loled at the subtitles when you stopped counting how many times he shot at 40-50 XDDD
LOL
"the irony of saying ""if her grades starts slipping up you white people that"" considering all the minority boosting in every educational facility..."
He should've walked up to the targets and slapped them.
Is that an audio editing error at 3:07? The little chuckle sounded doubled
Carful or he'll slap your tits off
This is not Floyd Lawton........
He needs to be in the suicide squad 3
Cool as shit that the subtitles say the make of the gun
I really like him as deadshot
shooting chris rock
All he wanted was his daugther to be happy and taken care of.    Wow
Will smith really did steal the spotlight in this movie.
this is one of my favorite scenes.
where is your EAR PROTECTION
"@ 2:14 at the bottom ""im lazy af, he fired 40-50 rounds"" lol"
man installed an aimbot irl lol
That guy looks like he's in trouble.  He should just smack all of the bad guys.
I love how half his demands are for his daughter
154M views? WTH?
Like a lot of other movies that are out there that was NOT Deadshot.... That was Will Smith... If I wanted to watch a movie with will Will Smith I would have watched something else.  Deadshot has a mask on almost all of the time.  Maybe Will Smith should have watched Dredd with Karl Urban... Karl could have taught him how to STAY IN CHARACTER.
You're ghey and never fired a bb gun if you like this sheet.
Atira muito bem caralho em que foda em mano gostei muito bom atira muito
"Look as much of a train wreck this movie was overall, it still has some pretty enjoyable scenes"
"Can we just take a moment to appreciate whoever wrote the subtitles, counted not only used rounds but classified each weapon by name and type as Deadshot picked them up. Well done sir or ma'am. Practically augmented reality."
That song slapped harder than
"Man, honestly will jokes are funny, but what the fuck would you do if you know something is happening to your gf,sister, wife which is embarrassing and shameful to them. Grow tf up."
It's just weird that you had to actually do all this at all because it's will smith. The thing is it makes no sense. Before he was bad hitman Deadshot. He was still Deadshot the awesome killer for the government. Soooo this scene not needed at all. It's like having a scene to be like hey magneto we want to recruit you but doubt if you can do what we have been told you can do. And then everyone's somehow surprised. There's a reason that scene is never put into a movie because it's stupid and easily forgettable.
1911. Best gun ever made. He chose the right gun as a first.
say the name
The infamous hitman missed the first shot from point blank distance
o ho
I would've loved this if it was accurate and everyone in the movie went deaf from no ear pro
"Love how he just smells the gun to check of that was real gunpowder or not.
Man has his own version of crack"
"Watch with Subtitles open
You can actually see the weapon type, ammo type, and ammo count.
Plus the best part, the subtitle editor added some humor at 2:14"
This movie looks absolutely retarded.
"So if he was talking to his boss and trying to make a point, why was he facing him and not Waller? Such a bad movie."
movie name plz
"This is a good film, I don't understand the hate for this film ...oh yeah mcu fans dislike it...."
"Despite being Silver, the player on the opposite team in the CS:GO match:"
This scene alone has a totally separate fanbase.
Typical Hollywood makes a soy boy look like a badass all to the magic of film.
"It would have been more impressive and realistic if bullets veer a little to the left or right and not in the same place all the time. He maybe is depicted as a skilled marksman, but there is no way he wouldve known the imperfections of the gun"
"""No, errand boy. I'm talkin' to your boss.""

Gawd. Will Smith really nailed this scene and this character."
Why is the American flag backwards?
When this movie came out i was 8 and i wanted to be deadshot so bad i got a stick and a coke bottle lid and kept throwing it up to hit it with the stick in mid air and thought i was cool .
best swedish actor alive
Fuck Darnell
It's interesting that if You enable the subtitles it puts the model of the weapon
I personally liked this movie its a great origin story for Suicide Squad
Suicide Squad was a doody movie but let's just say some scenes are elite
"Suicide Squad may have had it's share of ups and downs but it wasn't all bad, it had some good things going for it. I thought Will Smith carried the hell out of this movie with his great performance from start to finish and did a great job as Floyd Lawton / Deadshot, even Viola Davis was equally brilliant as Amanda Waller. I thought those two along with Margot Robbie were the best things about Suicide Squad, I really hope that we'll see more of them in the near future in the DCEU as they were the true standouts in this Suicide Squad movie"
"**You jokerz must be craaaaazyyy**

**Dude... IT WAS A G. I. JAAAANE joke**"
Just know Darnell cant come
"Run Darnell ...... Run long , run fast , run far .........."
Does someone know who Flag was going to call?
"tbh, his fee was quite reasonable haha"
"2 comments: shooting not possible, Lightfoot-like b*tch possible."
Who else here cause it got 153m views on this video
Can we appreciate the fact that someone put alot of effort into the captions
Even a scene as cool as this has the corniest fucking writting
Shifty movie
"Notice how Deadshot changes when he realizes the rounds are live. He smells the gun smoke and it's like he's high. This is a man who's entire live was based around shooting and after going so long (about 9 months) without touching a gun, he feels alive again and a sense of familiarity and I like how well the movie shows this."
This movie had so much potential.
"1:26..... Apparently as Legend has it Deadshot never misses... and he always has a target and that target is always hit..... Deadshot just sent a random bullet flying at nothing and don't say ""well he meant to do that""..... Deadshot always has a target and never misses.... the camera never followed the bullet or even shown what it hit... it was a random warning shot and Deadshot missed !..."
"Will Smith 100% carried this movie.

Change my mind."
everytime i watch this i get CHILLS!

"Deadshot is gone.

"Did Will Smith get himself ready for this scene by slapping watermelons?  I figure once he runs out of ammo, he will get to slappin people."

"You know I liked Gunn's Suicide Squad but David Ayer's Suicide Squad is better than Gunn's in a lot of cases. 
The Cast , The Characters , The Colour Palette, The Action sequences all are really good  what he botched is the antagonist.Yes you need a good antagonist to make superhero movies good , hence the failure .
And one thing The character enchantress  was really great like how she transforms and her backstory ,but Ayer just failed to exucute the character properly."

This video comes shows up in my recommended every damn year and every damn year I watch it.
Most retarded movie ever.
Typical Gun culture in America
It really shows that Lawton is not just about deadly aim. He instinctively is able to control the recoil in such a way that every bullet lands exactly where he wants it to land.
"as a Swede, it feels pretty cool that a Swedish actor is in a film like this"
bro he said aimbot activated
Any most accurate weapon has a spread. What is shown on the screen cannot be in principle.
"Now forgive me if I am rusty, I haven't played this game in a couple years."
"Will Smith is so cool in movies , and on reality a simp"
0 recoil
"""White people that thing?""  He means Hollywood that thing.  White people would fail and get kicked out of school."
The Cuck who Struck
So he can't even slap someone accurately but he can do allthat?
i woulda hit a bullseye with both eyes clsoed and make them join a suckide squad.....
This has so much potential
"0:59 Wow, even this guy is obsessed with his browser history. I wonder why............."
no matter what you say about will smith. He is a really good actor. I really like him. bad things happen to all of us and things get out of control for everyone. dont judge the peaple for what they have done in only 1 minute of their life
Bro got aimbots from fortnite
"""Ames, If this man shoots me...I want you to kill him...........and I want you to go clear my browsing history."""

"99% of the demands are for his innocent daughter so I don't know why they couldn't just refuse the first demand and accept the rest, deadshot would've definitely accepted it"
This alone was better than James Gunna Mcu suicide squad
the browser history joke is so forced
Great film
It physically hurts with how shit this move is
LENOIRSPANTHERES
I Love Deadshot
Except that's not how guns work at all. Just because you always have the sight aimed at someone doesn't mean it's guarantied to hit. Firing Inaccuracy is a thing.
"According to the new leaks, Suicide Squad kill the justice league will have two new special moves for deadshot that will never miss

the whole no hearing pro part makes me laugh
"He plays a shit talker on camera, but irl he's a cuck."
