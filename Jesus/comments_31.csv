This is a good moment but supermans out of sink lips are just too distracting.
What if wally west with MOLF force
With comic proof i can say flash win this race
"Superman is such an insperation to us all. no matter what we do. no matter how much we train. Superman is better without trying.

THANK YOU SUPERMAN! truely the rolemodel we need!"
"Even though this is one of the most widely hated CBMs ever, people got to admit this is one of the best post credit scenes in a CBM."
"I know this movie had some terrible things but, this scene, ignoring the weird moustache from barry, is what I have always dreamed off in a live action justice league, not warriors all the time, but simple friends"
yo vato I was tryna see the racenshit homie
superman cheated
How can someone run from that posture?
Why did flash do a goofy ahh running pose
naw its yo mama
lmao theyre both off the team now
THAT LIP!!!???!?!
"Something, something, cameraman faster than speed, something, something, cameraman still alive after time. Now give me likes because cameraman is faster than light of speed o' sound"
I forgot how bad the mustache removal effect looked.
HIS LIP IS SO WEIRD
This is actually a classic reference (Superman TAS)
Flash go ez
I think we should go for Flash vs Quick silver.
moustache
one thing this movie did better than the snyder cut is have superman actually interact with other JL members besides batman
"*plot twist, the flash was also the camera man"
"The real race was to see who could get fired faster, and Superman won"
Speedforce limits the Flash. He would be into. Superman doesn't have speed Force to be pulled into it. Superman is moving so fast begins to bend reality around it. It could be felt 5 different dimensions
The flash is a bestq
Didn't Flash went back in time 2-3sec @ Snyder's Cut?
lol
Where is complete race who win?
Their costumes here looks ridiculous.
"Jesus, the Superman suit is beautiful in this scene"
"I need the full movie, can someone help"
Flashes running pose though like if hemran normally with correct formation maybe he would be very very fast
Barry est le plus rapide rien a dire
Bruh this flash makes me want to punch a hole into a wall
Why is Henry's chin so awkward?
Nahh cgi for Henry's beard is weard as f
Who win?
"How could they cast such a morron as Flash? How can someone like him can even have a career, not just an actor but any succes at all?"
Wow they go from this armored suit to a lame skin tights spandex suit in his new movie.  Not supporting these movies anymore
Why would superman not race him on foot?
Compare Barry from this to the flash solo film he's a alot more likeable in the flash
"Superman: If I win you stop being a creepy weirdo that gets arrested once a month.
The Flash:I'm nonbinary and you'll adress me by the proper pronouns."
Goofiest run ever.
Goood
Man put cw flash in the movies instead of this character
We all know Superman lost the race
This race was actually in a cartoon...SUPERMAN SERIES. I really enjoy this kinda thing
too much speed that mustache burned to dust
Dice la legenda que asta la fecha aun siguen corriendo
123456ttt
this flash suit looks better than the weirdo cgi one from the solo movie
Better than snyder cut in my opinion
Flash
Superman flew so fast the wind blew and and left his face like that
"""Those were for charity, Clark."""
"i like both the movies(versions) one being too short and i don't have problem s with long movies. only thing i don't like in snyder verese was that age differences were too much, and with ryan reynolds as hal jordan and martian manhunter as starting the team."
"Flash can outrun time, & it caused a lot of problems so he needed to slow down."
I think superman win because he is flying
Ezra miller on his way to Hawaii
Best scene of Whedon-cut
Bamos  flash
Gucam
Awful and cringe acting of Miller. You can tell Cavil was seething just standing right in front of him
That scene in Smallville is pretty cool too
Here is something to ruin the scene for you all. Look at Flash chest at 1:00
thank you for blocking the final shot with your stupid annotations
Other flash from the show better
What's up with Cavill's mouth?
"This looks horrible! The lighting, the Superman suit, showing the silver undersuit, the color grading. It looks like they just went outside and filmed with a dslr."
"Superman:flash your faster then I thought 
DCEU flash:same goes for you 
CW flash: what took you so long?"
This video is good.
Amazing Video
I haven't seen superman on the big screen for a long time we need him back in movies
We need superman back it's been far too long without him
"If this movie is at all faithful to the comics...

...then Flash wins this race. 

Barely."
the flash more fast than superman we can see when evil superman fight in justice league scene...the flash more fast but he not strong when superman touch him
Good
Smallville serie showed that flash was faster
Can the cameraman fly since it started from the sky?
They both slow af.
superman is beast and win
Superman also could turn back in time by moving way faster than light to save Lois lane when she died in the old movie.
"Die ganze Welt lebt in der Nachkriegszeit ?

lieber Netflix !"
The DEVIL OAR SATAN
I am fasted because i am wachting
Atleast Its Not For Charity This Time
Name movie
Hated that Sup suit. The MoS suit was so much better.
OMG
Guys the camera man is the fastest mannnn
Boo
....
Don't you love it when the video puts other thumbnails at the end so you can't see anything
I would like to see this scene again when the justice league and the dc universe will be more stable not necessarily between superman and flash maybe between speedsters
If i win you need to stop this channel
Superman flying is kinda a cheat..
If only we got this version of superman in a Henry Cavill Stand alone.
Why Superman wear cape?
They are both fast wht??
Flash is fast
The flash won. Post credit scene snieder
"Laloe to confident might of outsiders have reason for droppin' Aztec soceaty, these why might overs style over ""the inca"", maian apperance into Atlantic of not going concern of goals, of mountain bike of Aztec was conditionalies, fast flame of purple stick tree in mean flames of bakso likes overs importance, these not overs talk,but your impirtance ment destinies overs my, fourty forth year old."
goofy ah running pose
DC SHOWS SUCKS
Remembered me Smallville Flash vs Superman Race
This movie superman looks terrible
The camera man is so fast
Ezra runs like a queer
I hate how I much I love Ezra as the flash
.
Who puts click boxes in a short video??
Too bad we never know who wins
I love how thumbnails of next videos appear just when the action starts :(
I'd love to of seen that
U
Obviously its flash remember he can time travel/:
"Such a gay ass pose , gtfo with that shit"
hay naku po ---hindi kami criminal po kasi hagbay ra po kami nag-surender po kahit pa sa Government po ...
anak tayo lahat po
superman too op
"Heeeey, thanks for covering up the characters at the best part of the entire clip with links for your other videos... love that"
"It's really stupid the fact that superman can even compete.

Why not just have give compete what th god for omnipotence"
https://youtu.be/XhJN3z1wdXc
Who runs like that!! Lame flash
i  think   is  flash  win
"Superman is taking an evening stroll past the church when the Minister runs down the steps calling for his help.
""Superman, we need your help, a wall has collapsed in the basement, some workmen are trapped!"" says the Minister.

""No way"" said Superman ""I'm not going near the crypt tonight""."
Smallville better
One of the very few moments in the JW version of JL that I like.
"Wait, who actually won tho???"
Nobody wants to discuss the devastation of the immediate surroundings? So many deaths... So many deaths.
faster faster faster
Who won the race?
This flash was super cringy
A lesser-known power of Superman is that it's constantly windy anywhere he is so his cape is always billowing.
Part 2
"1:00 Look at Barry's chest plate on his left side, the fact that Warner let this slide during QC tells you just how much they done goofed up."
Yo creo que gana superman
My family daimons kristal.superman.tolong family saya...kita kan sekeluarga.untuk jaga OKU...nyawa mereka penting...mereka juga keluarga daimons kristal..juga...
This sucks
The speed star of all universaes
FLASH
Who is win i don't no because  camera men is fast and no full video
I really hate how Barry runs tho. Imagine a kid running track like that lol
"Odeio esse jeito esquisito do flash correr, parece gay."
Am Japanese 2 Japanese  not gay interest is normal spelling
Fan matchbox 2
Enough
"Technically Superman was cheating. It was a race, meaning running. Superman was flying and therefore negated any risk of tripping or having to run around building while Flash has to avoid things like cars since his speed would probably kill him if he hits something, while Superman could just smash through it with no problem.

Therefore, Flash is faster than Superman."
The director and cameraman also very fastest.
So uh who won?
https://youtube.com/@GOLDMOVIE1212
GITUDOWAG
That Flash hand gestures when running is so awkward and cringe man eww
"Y'know what's funny is Joss's style of humor could've made Superman just randomly having a mustache here kinda work. ""New look?"" ""Yeah I'm trying it out."""
Dude thats not how you run
Super man had to fly to keep up
And they all teach in schools that cheetah is the fastest
the winner always OP Man..:)
this was just horrible. Everything after Men of Steel was just crap. And men of steel was 8/10 tops.
"nice job..u get to play super something..and still get millions...
while the rest of the world eat shit.."
I don't know why people hate on Joss Whedon's cut so much. It's scenes like this that show that he has actually read the comics and knows the characters unlike Snyder who just wants to make everyone depressed smh
Wish they actually showed the race.
Who won tho?
I wonder how Ezra runs in real life
What's weird is that DC Comics has really good animated cinematic universe. Then even after using up down left right up down left right a b a b L1R1 L2R2 to get super huge cheat budget to make this work they still couldn't make it work
I hate this flash
I will never understand why Ezra Miller always ran like someone who has no idea what running is.
ironic how the flash actor doesn't know how to run IRL lmao... he's flapping his arms around like a frog...
Good bye superboy best friends
I hate those dumb lines on supes suit
Legends says they are still competing
That flash run and pose was cringe as hell
"W... wh...why did they think it looked cool to have flash stand like that, and run like that. It doesn't look good, or cool, or real. None of the above."
Making barry sound funny is a hell of an idea... making him sound stupid is the worst one though
How win?
boy that cgi unstache....
Where can I watch this part
The worst part about this scene is how they butchered the cgi on Henry Cavilles beard
But.. but. only Flash can travel back in the past.
"Flash: ""If I win, you have to wear your underpants outside your pants."""
the camera man wins
RIP Supes' upper lip
The camera man
henry cavil out as superman
Flash has to win beacuse that's his main power and speed is one of superman's extra powers it wouldn't make sense for flash to be slower
Both are faster
BOY
This scene sucks
Flash won that 100%
The worst Flash ever put to film.
The flash
The (post) end credits will show Ezra getting arrested for grooming charges in the Flash film.
Day
50% of audiences did not make it to this scene
So who won?
"What did Flash mean by?, ""if I win I get to tell everyone"""
That is not how barry stands at all before he runs and superman was supposed to run here not fly
If Flash isn't faster than Superman then what's the point of having a Flash?
Man those Superman lips still haunt me.
SUPERMAN IS WIN
Who tf runs like that tho
Erase Ezra miller
Flash's starting pose is just ridiculous.
who won?
Ok their speed is impressive and all but obviously the camera man is the fastest
Ezra miller as the flash suckkssss
Mempries
Ok Mr lul_gamer is it because th camera man Is teleporting
How many gears for reverse do that camera man have?
"Hvivgtwx*-"":""""

"""If I win l, you're off the team.""

Gunn: ""Reverse write that down!!"""
"Wow ezra actually won this time instead of Henry just like the Casting."""
We all know the flash wins
But can they beat Goku?
hi guys i'm brazilian
I hate the flash stance before running erghhhh
That mustache
hi
"Flash : Im the fastest
Superman : Im the fastest
Camera man. *Hold my beer"
Tuggg
"This is the scene that made the movie so great. All agree? So great. Man
 What a great sceene."
Rikky
Its so stupid on why barry gotta put his hands like that to run ..
I always thought this flash had the coolest suit
I really loved the race between these two in smallvile. It was awesome
HEHE OHIO CITIZENS BE LIKE
My favorite flash
Flying not the same as running bruh bruh
"Flash should've won because in the comics, flash was able to sprint faster than instant teleportation in a race in space"
Knowing that this post credits scene has more views than any of Marvel's movies!! And it's only post credits scene!!
There is no Justice League movie by Joss Whedon. Here we are safe. Here we are free.
The Smallville race was way better.  They made this flash is annoying - and not cool.
I don't think it really matters what direction they go in to see the Pacific when it's that fast
"I wish they give entire dc universe to Snyder, he would make dc fans proud"
Nah flash is faster he runs from cops all around the world
Ezra is fucking awful as Barry. I can't believe they kept him over Henry. Ridiculous.
if superman stays caught up with flash everyone dies. the flash has the speedforce which negates physics but supes doesnt.
Flash armor is terrible on this one.
Man of Steel vs Godspeed
Flash would win because he is so fast he can travel in time unlike superboi
Flash is way faster then Superman if you know the history of their battles in race but Superman is 2nd
And it is a tie.
Flash runs like a toddler.
He would have changed time had he run faster. Flash is the fastest of all
1:02 Me and my Brother when Mom says Dinner's ready
I never liked the way Ezra milkier ran so dramatic
Flash didn't use the speed force
"James ""Bun"" Rejects Henry to be Superman
Fans be like: ""The mass extinction we feared has already begun"""
Esta escena era valiosa y en la de Zack la eliminaron :c
Azharali
Don't understand this as superman can fly back in time.
they made such a huge mistake not keeping him for superman..the man radiates the character
shi crazy
In the comics were Superman and the Flash race Flash wins
Still to this day hate how ezra fucking runs
I don't even care about the actor playing The Flash I'm not going to say his name he sucks he's ruining the franchise he's the reason why they're not putting the movie out faster
Very weak writing they should have had a winner this is why DC loses
The Flash is so gay its actually sickening
"God this has to be the most cringe flash actor ever! Flash has always been the confident and cocky type of character. Not a shaky, cowardly and a WordOfWarcraft like gamer. Plus he's a terrible actor"
Nice muscle graphics on your legs Superman..... what is this 1968
We'll never know who won
I thought Sups will also run.
"The flash thinks faster, both can move fast enough to screw with time but the Flash has the speedforce in some iterations and can process faster movement, Superman generally has to really build to it at the point of messing with time."
Weird fuckin dude man.
"in cinema, Superman can match Flash's speed, Flash can dodge Superman's punch, but to say Superman is faster than Flash is not, because Flash's speed can make him change whole time."
Haha you suck im best speed
Would've been more impactful if Superman stayed on the ground and also ran.
Ezra is so embarrassing as the flash. They could've at least hired someone who's ran in their life.
Sh
Bro Flash's running poster is like someone in a horror movie's
Flash bout to do his gae as run
The only superhero that DC comics had that was any good was the Flash. Back when comics were 12 cents they raced. Flash won.
They raced their way out of DCEU..
To think These 2 actors have been axed by the justice leauge one for stealing and the latter for retiring
If you fell off a building and either of these guys caught you while traveling at this speed....well yer just a bug on a windscreen.
Why a billionaire making the Flash buy brunch for everyone
Bruh who you like this to you llok this in a TV
2
I love you super man
Super man Big hool
Flash is only that fast because hes run from cops for so long.
https://youtu.be/DlSZwmcSsPk this is amazing
Superman wins no doubt
Masum. Alam
Ok we all know Superman would win. As he always has. But I feel like Grant Gustins Flash would be able to keep up.
what the heck the rat is that
Who won?
www.youtube.com/@llski
Ezra miller runs weird lol
"Pls, full scene"
Amit
Abcd...
Only scene I like in the 2017 one
Flash going ssj2
Why is superman flying he should run to stupid
On the ground flash is clearly faster. Look it up Superman can't compare to his top speed..#facts
Amazing brows
Wow that pedophile could really run fast
Realyy
Thank god Ezra miller is no longer flash
The flash is not faster than Superman. Speed force comes from Superman. Superman is the creator of DC universe. Flash is a incarnation of Superman speed. Superman is the Creator of the Speed Force. Superman let Flash win. Superman does not have to do it. Superman understand he will destroy the earth if beats the Flash.  Flash stated that out in Space Superman exceeds Flashs own abilities. Flash stated Superman was traveling so fast he it felt through the DC multiverse.
Superman should've just grabbed Flash and snapped his neck Zod style. That would've been the funniest scene in the DCEU
Sponge Bob: am I a joke?
The only reason Ezra was able to run that fast is because he heard police sirens behind him
"While the Flash or Barry Allen is the fastest ""man"" alive, Superman is an alien and has powers beyond that of any mortal human, mutant or the likes. In all of the DC Universe there are only two records of the Flash besting Superman. It is my personal opinion that Superman could  beat the Flash if he wanted too, but remember Superman is is also super humble so I believe it demonstrates the deeper level of writing for Superman's characteristics in these two circumstances. Let the Flash be the Flash."
This is definitely Connor and I at Lambert's.
How fast are they really running?
Can never get passed that horrific FX on Cavill's upper lip.
henry cavill still got the mustache when they were shooting for this scene right?
???
https://youtu.be/2tR5ie8bjP4
Legends say that they are racing infinite
"Cameraman: ""slow poke."""
I like the flash character. Too bad the guy playing the part is a total douchbag in real life.
Super man I fast
"Smallville actually did it right with young Clark and young Bart. At their farewell Bart basically shows Clark that he's WAY faster and has been the whole time. Pretty awesome oldschool wholesome moment lol. 

If you take that kind of reasoning and pair it with knowing Barry is basically just as fast, that he can alter timelines, and has a lot of experience with the speed force.. Barry could basically scour the galaxy for kryptonite til he finds it.. utilize it as a weapon against Superman.. and then kill him with it before Superman could even formulate a plan of defense."
Cameraman: good job kids
It's not fair on a physical level. Superman flies and therefore has much less resistance to fight than Flash who runs on the ground. ^^
Cw flash negs (talking about speed)
Filmin ismi ne
Why flash look like retard?
https://youtube.com/shorts/m6r7fXlm3tE?feature=share
This abomination
Camera man wins
He apparently used that superspeed to commit horrible crimes against women. Sad.
Legend says they are still racing...
"It's stupid when Superman is shown to be even close to Flash's speed. When it comes to TV shows and movies, I think Smallville handled this the best."
Superman should have ripped that pedos head off
Movie?
the camera man: and if I win y'all gotta gimme a better pay or gimme a challenge
Flash might beat him if Superman ran not fly?
"Well, At the speed flash travels, he would smash into millions of objects before even blinking and die. lol"
Meanwhile the cameraman waiting for them at the finish line
Why are flesh not Barry Alen
Llllllooik
I kinda wish Snyder kept this Scene in the Snyder cut I'm probably the only one that thinks that
"The loser is gonna dress like Joker
Winner is going on a date with wonderwoman"
The bet should be who is the fastest man by running not flying.
a good end to a bad movie
Superman wins
quien gano??
"What about cameraman.he is faster than       
Both"
Don't let this man go. He plays a good flash. Made me laugh. Don't leave him  behind.
"Plot twist: The flash IS the camera man, hes going so fast hes in two places at once."
Pis part 2

Koi mil raha hai
Who won
Cameraman running on lightspeed
https://youtu.be/T26sJCSHH2g
Cameraman: ill cya at the other side of the earth:D
Flash is not fastest the camera man is
Josstics league
"I really hate Superman's muscle suit.  I know he was still wearing one MoS, but it didnt look this fake."
Why does the flash run like an idiot?
The ending: Superman wins the race and flash was asked to pack his stuff and get off the team.
Who would win Flash or Sonic?
He ran right into unemployment.
Justice league 2017 superman and flash race after superman animated series demon speed race by flash and superman from watching by Lois Lane lane and Jimmy Olsen and new supergirl tv series race by supergirl and flash
Idk if it's a movie or an episode but i already seen superman and flash race where flash speed travel time idk who won tho.
"In the DCeased comic, though, it was different."
See even though Barry's a little fast than Superman as that's his core source of power the original comic writers never actually showed who actually won it's just said theoretically that flash would win which is respect to the characters
"The flash would never lose,with the speed force"
Grant makes best
Gnk
i hate this flash
https://youtube.com/channel/UCQEK7x0_kqLzNeQIhcjLoPQ
Dude men are supposed to do the macho measuring thing i hate the programming
Camera man made superman and flash looks so SLOW
How come I never saw this in Justice league and Snyder's Justice league too?!?!
ridicoulus
ezra miller looks like a kid that thinks he fast
Why does flash run so weird in justice league
Cringe
"Papa franku, is that you?"
Impossible
The flash's run is a very dofusy run.
Gggggggggg
Move name
For the fastest flash  alive he doesn't know his coordinates
Flash reminds me of phoebe buffay going out on a run.
"I want to see a scene where Superman, Wonder Woman, Bat Man, Aquaman, Cyborg, and the Flash are all in a room and a nuke goes off.
Wonder who would walk out of the room?"
Worst flash ever !
"There's the predator Superman!
Hurry up and catch him before Ezra abducts another minor"
WHO is win???????????
who woon ?/?/?????????
Groomer Flash
Back in the day when Josstice League got good reviews
I think superman won that race.
Pla ket KET KET KET makin my way down down with the block and the Glock blowin away with  the max pla ket KET KET ket
Too bad the flash is such a sycophant in real life
Atj6ebs7ie Jake ywko
This facts maybe can be interesting to you -https://youtu.be/g0QFbWL6p7g
Was this in the movie or just a youtube video
what is the name of this movie
Cgi moustache Superman races a felon who runs like gay
Camera man is also superhero.
"The Flash and Superman are pretty fast, but they got nothin on Usain Bolt."
sadly he couldnt run this fast away from the police!
Superman pointed at right direction of pacific even though he is an alien but knows about earth more than humans lol
"We need to add vs cameraman, and cameraman wins by far"
well definitely now this shit hits differently
"And thats why 

Flash is useless"
Wait....so is nobody talk about the face that this is a race....but superman .... flies....like wtf...what's the point of a foot race...if he blipping flies?!?
"Hopefully the outfit will be designed better for the next Flash movie, I seriously don't understand why they thought that this outfit was good, the colour is wrong, this outfit is black with maroon plastic on it, if it were red, it would've been better, even though red itself is wrong, they got it way wrong with the colour, hopefully they can improve the design of The Flash outfit, other than that, I like Ezra Miller as the Flash"
Why is reverse flash here
Ezra ran that fast when the cops chased him
But the camera man is always faster
Oh shit - they have footage of Ezra Miller running from his pedo charges?
https://youtu.be/0jacFiPYvWo
Hi
this flash is trash
bro Ezra just got arrested again oml
"Not a kids, a grown-up man who use to look DC even in his/her childhood will aware that Flash is actually faster than Superman. Also there are many few characters from DC who are faster than Superman..."
Cooler if he ran
yo ni daudina paryo ni
Road runner is fastest
Why is superman flying
https://youtube.com/channel/UCMR3K1-NgezFtq2xVduIflA
Ironically this is the last time they appear as flash and superman
"Oh Ezra , was it worth losing everything?"
Worst flash I've ever seen. The bar has been set low. Congrats to whoever plays flash next.
Funny superman suit.
Who actually wom tho?
Bring
India is heaven https://youtu.be/P--mjazvHZY
And possible for Superman   Flash faster
So we don't get to know who won then...?
Thumbs down that's the cheapest clip I've ever seen
Why flash has to be gay?
This scene was the only thing good in the Josstice League
Justice league flash runs like his arms are broken
Marvel is best
Wow it is very good
Imagine how fast is 2021 Superman maybe faster than CW flash
why tf is bro running like that
LisTo
"I guess when Flash doesn't show up in Justice League 2, all you have to say is Superman won."
"And that moment on, no one knows who won"
And now he is having a race against the police
you call that a race when it didnt even show a full race and just went to the credits scene lmao
FLASHES MAN BOOB
Ezra Miller would've been faster to show his genitals in real life. That's why he's called Flash.
"10,000 nearby crimes could have been stopped while they were racing."
That's stupid.  Should've been a foot race to the nearest highway truck stop known for buying gay sex and meth.
Kkk. Vcs iventam de tudo.kk..
Irone men the win
oh and the smallville scene was better
superman cheats
a-train vs homelander ?
"Flash: Aa... You know, I've never seen the Pacific

Superman: *Points in the opposite direction""

Flash: ""Which is that way... Cause...."""
I am form india
How @AVI SUPER FACT
Sucks that this was what we got instead of the speed force
The cameraman proof finally
Why does this flash run in such a weird way. Is he supposed to do that?
ja trocaram as calcinhas.
although I hate this version this scene is pretty cool
In this scene it was every no offense runner vs me like in Ontario they started crying and I beat them because I was slower than every woman just training running but in Ontario I won this time vs every runner
"Damn bro I wanna see who won, I already know but still I hate yippie when the video cuts at th best part"
"Yeah, okay. 
So who won?"
Pedo vs Real man... we know who actually wins overall don't we DC. Though DC doesn't deserve that amazing Real man actor anymore.
"Superman must've won the match.

(If you know, you know.)"
Now Ezra actually doin Tay K the race
the flash fruity af
Ok great but can they outrun the Springfield Monorail?
The camera man moonwalked faster than both of them.
Man I wish Ezera wasnt a POS.
God superman's suit looks like he bought it from comic con
0:25 you can see Henry Cavill's mustache
Doesn't he know that he can't catch flash he's in another universe
"So the Flash's thing is that he is super fast. Superman's thing is that he can also fly, he has super strength, is durable to the point where he's invincible to a lot of attacks, has laser eyes, and so on, and so forth. So if he was also faster or as fast as the Flash... he's basically just a far better Flash?"
Oh
Superman is faster
Flash runs gay
Who the hell told him to run like that
0:15 he is off the team anyway
"Honestly just surprised they dont have him start shooting webs. No idea how dc animation can knock it out of the park effortlessly time and time again, but ruin every live action adaptation at the same time. Flash isnt the web slinger no matter how badly you wanna replicate tom hollands performance in other more successful films."
Flash is faster
https://youtube.com/channel/UCDuJjoLqNVjDlThSU9Je-fA
I hope the flash can have its own movie
Pakai makan minum gerak bebas
I hate this movie with a passion but I will admit I love this scene and wish some version of it was in the Snyder Cut.
Ezra Miller is the beat character for flash
I really wanted to know who won
"I'm just going to say it; there are actually parts (usually with Superman) of the theatrical cut that I like better than the Snyder Cut. Joss Whedon might have been a horrible asshole on set, and his style doesn't hang together very well with Snyder's, but at least he lets Superman have a personality."
Lvl 9999999999999 camaraman
No fair flying
Superman in flying is unbeatable but in running he is slower than flash by a little
Barry Allen didging kidnapping charges

"Watching this clip knowing that the actor preys on minors and now another 12 year old's family had to get an order of protection against him, is kind of scary. I hope he turn himself into police soon and gets therapy."

"https://youtube.com/shorts/Cke1Fe2zbuA?feature=share
Thor vs superman"
I just found out the flash is able to run 13 trillion times the speed of light.
"*BEST SCENE IN THIS MOVIE TBH*



#RestoreTheSnyderVerse 
#MakeTheBatfleckMovie"
Saitama was the camera man.
And that kids is how superman killed us all
Who won this race? Or is it a tie?
"I gotta say, I never expected a random camera man to be faster than both Superman and The Flash."
This is fucking embarrassing.
Superman is fly but Flash is run
Who is faster cameraman?
"Camera man was infront of them, so I'd camera man won"
"Flash:I'm faster
Super man:no I'm faster
Camera man:yeah yeah keep talikng"
The actor that pretends to be the Flash likes to go by the Pronouns PUUUUUUUSSSSY Boi.
O
Gaji lu udh gede ya bang
can superman outrun the flash?
"Toretto -  Sean
Flash - Superman
who is the winner? :D"
Superman is supposed to run not fly on the foot race
they need a new flash.
They are both fast but remember The Flash can slow down time. Making him faster than Superman. The Flash should have been at The Pacific Ocean before Superman started
What About Super Sonic Huh!
46er64
https://youtu.be/rxreIDzhF1g
Idk why i was subbed to you xd
"Super man : Me fastest
Flash:me light
Cameraman:I have completed school which u in"
"For those wondering their top calculated speeds:
Superman: 92.4 quadrillion miles per hour
Flash: 13 trillion times 186,282 (13trill times speed of light) which equals 2.421666e+18"
Good to see super heros not going in their underpants anymore
Who was the cameraman
So who won
Ezra Going Back To Jail Again After Being Released: 1:02
This video has more views than the Will Smith Oscars slap video. Just let that sink in
"Camera Man is ""The Reverse Flash"""
Jjj
Lol great stuff.
"I never watched the Justice League movie and with this 1:21 clip, I already hate The Flash when he was my favorite in the animated series."
Si yo fuera flahs le piso la capa a superman  haha
superman
super cool
LO L.....?
These people have to make the flash faster or there is no point of having him
"Total race's...
Flash wins : 80 %
Superman wins : 20 %"
cu
But who is the winner
https://youtu.be/67xlcy_F0bI
Who won ?
Give.   A.  Money.  Ok
did you remember when superman spinned back the globe
flash is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay faster then superman!
Flying is cheating and Flash is running. So Superman should run instead of flying
Lame.
dis Kuesi
Look at flash' face
"Facts: superman is faster than flash IF his flying.

BUT flash is faster than any dc and marvel heroes if people talks about marathon."
Fastest is warna brother
Camera man be like ok but i am not very impressed
"That Ezra Miller's Flash is so adorable and sweet I guess shows what a great actor he is?  I don't know, but I just love this scene so much.  This and the scene where he catches the batarang out of the air... both are perfection."
"Well flash can run that fast he can even go back in time so, he should win"
Super man bi to bhaga na
But who won.
Flash sila
Superman bike
FLASH IS ALWAYS FAST THEN SUPER MAN
"I think this is...a tie. Superman will remind Bruce to ask Barry to take the team out to ""brunch"", and Barry gets to tell everyone."
Y
keren banget
The speed difference between the two is massive Don't really ask me how Superman spinning around the Earth turned back time but apparently flash can just run through time So it's like playing tennis but one side doesn't have a racket
Un
Diana: children!
Wow
I'm always faster
nice
LOL
Evy
I wish this movie had way more of these types of moments. it represents more the spirit of what the justice league stood for.
Can't stand how the movie Flash Runs looks like he will fall or just hit a wall any minute.
superman has only one weakness see superman can never defeat flash cuz he is faster and can rewind time and dceu flash is slow
Sooo fast flash
Who wins?
Look how flash runs like an idiot how ok earth someone can run this fast lile this?
Super man gonder ethipa cemon
Sonic flash man Super man Super race
This is actually a great scene and for those that didn't think Cavill could play the hopefully and more light hearted Superman this version of JL movie is enough proof that he  can. The negative about this scene!? Geezus fuckin Kryst that Superman suit is horrible!!!  MOS and BVS had the best suit for Supes with MOS being the best of the 3 movies
Iyih
there is drag on supes cape
"Mpa pararam pam pam
Pararam papapampam
Mparararamp pararam"
"The pose that Flash makes before he starts running is the most anti-sport shit I've ever seen, how is he even going to run with an arm behind his head"
YO CREO QUE LOS 2 SON LOS MAS VELOCES DEL MUNDO . XD
The 1 in 2 scence I like most in josstice league
Costumes look pretty stupid.
've lways fou de Ezra strange for portraying flash but I've never read a flash comics so...
Race. Flash
Why does JL look like a show that would air on the CW
POWERFULL YOUR MONSTER
Mabur cuuuu
"The cameraman joke was funny at first, BUT WOULD EVERYONE STOP COPYING  THE ORIGINAL GUY?"
I like Avengers
I don't like DC
why does superman decide whos on the team tho
Kelokra
https://youtu.be/mkuIlDIy5Bo
This Flash sounds so unmanly
Nice CGI cape.
I love the the race
This is so childish even my 5yo self is cringing
"i want to see snyder cut flash versus christopher reeves superman 

didnt they both go faster than the speed of light?"
The flash is like Dom in his dodge charger and superman is like Brian in his supra Mk4 but that would make him supra man instead of Superman.
"Wow, a million cameraman jokes. Never saw that coming. Doesn't anyone think for themselves anymore? Oh, dumb question."
Was the flash that fuckin dorky in the comics?
0:21
0:22
"you the bloody hell where is the main scene
raskal"
Very good is the best
True the camera man is the fastest
Confused who won
Great ending
It's so obvious who's faster it's the camera man come on
I saw this race  in the WB cartoon version
"They're so fast, like teleporting but the cameraman actually teleported"
Para que existe cualquier personaje si Superman los supera. Por eso odio a Superman
"Ok according to science, Superman gonna win as Superman is flying and Flash is running, there's less FRICTION in air than Ground"
Fast guy ain't got a chance against Kal-El
Flash would go the opposite direction and still win
"The Flash is faster than Superman. He has won five of their nine races, with three ties and only one win from Superman. Still, even the fastest Speedster, Wally West, stated that given enough motivation, Superman could get a big enough boost to gain extra speed and become faster than any of the Speedsters."
"In earth's atmosphere Flash is way faster thanks to the speed force.
Superman is not allowed to reach light speeds in the earth atmosphere otherwise he will wreck the earth.
In the outer space Superman can go many times faster than light."
It's fun to see this scene coz they did the exact same scene in the cross-over series of flash and supergirl.. hehehe..
I consider Superman Faster & Stronger than Flash!!!!!
But I like Grant gusting more than this barry
"If there is one thing Joss Wheadon knows, it's classic Superman. He got his personality right in this cut of the movie...at least the classic version of the character. I think this proves that when Snyderverse Superman was going to become prime, classic Superman, that Henry Cavill could pull it off. Henry was born to play Superman."
"so, who won??"
Qqq
This flash's  running stance is dumb a fuck
Is The Flash purposely a gay character or is that just a coincidence?
Nice
Makes
Is it just me or is the Flash's stance kinda cringe
Slow and steady win the race
Batman would smoke both of them in a race
GEAL
LEGEND SAYS THAT : NO ONE KNOWS WHO IS THE WINNER
Vs
Movie name
The winner is the road end barrier xD
"""I've raced you before, Barry. I even won some of those races.""
""Those were for Charity Clark.""
*Boom*"
"Oh, dude, I really hate this goofy flash, and I said it as a fan"
"The best Fastest person is..............,. Cameraman"
Woow !! Cool video
"Who said its camera main is noob, they use editing"
Sm can't win
Is this a real thing that happened in the joss whedon cut?
You guys know that flash is kind off happy that their is someone in the world who can keep up with him. And he is not alone
i cant stop seeing supermans mouth
Snyder cut >
It's a damn shame they made Superman so fucking weird because they digitally reconstructed his upper lip.
Typical DC never satisfying
"The guy who plays flash was in one of the most fd up movies I've ever seen and on the YouTube comments ALL the girls fetishized him. He played a psycho that abused his mom, killed his dad's and little sister, then shot up his school with a bow and arrow. The comments just show that the average person is horrifically evil. Messed up to look up to someone like that"
this was cringy
the worst barry allen ever!  the worst!
God this movie sucked
For people who think superman would win this race. I pity you lol
What's going on with Superman's mouth? is it CGI?
Supreman
They don't even stand a chance Infront of the camera man
"Have you ever wonder how Superman see the flash?
Will the answer is he have 1780 fps eyes"
"The Flash is running in a vertical position while Superman is flying in a horizontal position. If they were both moving the same speed at the waist, Superman would still have the advantage by a chest & arms length. That's cheating."
Whats with Supes jaw?
"Lame, worst rendition of the flash even all the head and hand movements and the voice. And if they are having a foot race, why is superman flying"
They should've made more versions of superman like this.... the fun type of a superman movie where you actually see him smile ...
This is sick!
Quick sliver >>>> super men + flesh
Flash is faster by a trillion miles.
Better than every single frame from the shit director's cut
"Fans really get on my nerves. ""My favorite character is better despite what comics say"". You guys really make  being a fan of comics TOXIC. Just accept that your favorite character cannot beat everyone in everything!! And accept the truth!! Your fangirling and fanboying will not change the truth"
"This is a cool video, but why does this have 115 million views lol"
That Pack is 3D BRUH LOL!!
Flying is cheating
josticeleagye
B
Flash running style is so cringe
))
"Flash is faster, seeing that cause of countless ACTUAL sources, but not only that, even if superman could run as fast as flash he could'nt do it without destroying the earth seeing he has no access to the speed force"
Is flash ice skating
Cleber d
Hru
What does the camera man win?
Ezra Miller is so garbage as Barry lol
heh what a weakling
"They might as well give Flash hover shoes, so he can at least run like Shadow"
"Superman has Super speed; in the Comics, there were LITERAL RACES between them.  Dude ain't supposed to FLY!"
"aynen kanka
en dc sizsiniz"
Superman would win. He can turn back time.
The cameraman begging to stop talking about him.
At least Flash doesn't run like Steven Seagal.
"No doubt!
Obviously super man will win
Because flash is running
And superman is flying.
Both have the ability of speed. But,
Super man's speed from almighty's power 
Flash's speed from a lightning accident.
And On the basis of stamina flash is not able for long runs. He will be tired."
"Dumb scene, really nerfed Flash"
This dialogue is i feel like how these characters would talk. that one part of them talking is the only good part of josstice league
Flash's stance annoys me.
