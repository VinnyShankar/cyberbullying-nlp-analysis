A MAJOR error: you can't do 3x+1 on negative numbers and expect it to be the same thing.3x+1 will translate as 3x-1 to negative numbers.  Negaitve and positive numbers are symettrical so it's obvious.
Its 4x
"This is a joke, right? What is it that people are trying to find proof of? I mean, obviously take out the 3X and just add or subtract one from any odd number and it becomes divisible by two. This will eventually lead to one. You can multiply by three but you will always divide more by two, because you change all the odd numbers to even."

"I'm sure someone already knows this, but if you do 3x-1 on negative numbers it seems to have the same affect, and if you put positive numbers into 3x-1 it comes out with the same loops as the negative numbers do in 3x+1. I find that fascinating.

"One thing I noticed is that all the numbers are full numbers.
But with fractions - they don't follow the same rules.
IE 1/3 is an infinite .3333
Obviously not 1/3 because it'd equal 2 after the first *3+1. But there are a lot of fractions that equal infinite decimals.

Try 4/9. If I'm correct, it'll get stuck in a loop, but not 4,2,1."

"I don't understand the argument that because of the halting problem (or rather undecidability of the problem) we might never know if Collatz Conjecture is true or false. That doesn't make much sense to me. If problem is undecidable it only means you can't write a program which solves it, but it doesn't mean you can't prove it by other means. For example for halting problem you can just prove that the program always stops by doing proper analysis of the code."

"You can't compare the Polya conjecture to the Collatz conjecture. Polya's conjecture was just based on a lucky guess and some trial and error, and it was proven that a counterexample could be constructed given enough calculation power (which did not exist yet at that time). So they already had proven that you can construct a number that will break the conjecture, even before they could do the actual computational work, and they estimated that number to be somewhere in the order of 10^300. But the point was, it was already proven without doing the calculation. And later when they actually had the computational power, they found even much lower numbers that already broke the conjecture. with Collatz, they tested every single number up to 2^68, and all of them ended up at 1. There is no theory whatsoever that even hints at breaking Collatz conjecture."

"This is does have a theoretical sollution.
This equasion will always with every number go back down to 1, or ends up in its own loop.
Why. 
It gives random sequences meaning that even if you where to find a number that climbes infinitly you would never be able to put an end point to it.
You cant trust it because of its random outcomes.
Even if you were to find a number climbes endlessly you always have an new number to calculate. 
And never have an endpoint or a true stopping point to your calculation. Even if you hit a number that is 1^10000000^1000000^100000^100000 you can always climb higher.

Also one thing is true, that if you ever where to find an infinit climbing number every number that get touched in that sequence is also infinite.
Same within a number loop, every number that gets touched gets also will run within the same loop. 
Which is the cool part of this sequence, you dont need to check every number. Cuss every number that you touch on the way will make the same path down from that point."

"Isn't this just a problem of ""Does 3x +1 always lead to a power of 2?"""
"I think I got the reason - we do 3x+1 to make it an even number and then divide with 2 to make a small number so we know every even number always end with 2 it is definitely end with 2 at the end and to get 2 we need 4 so that we can divide it by 2 to get 2 and 2 divided by 2 is equal 1 but when we do 3x+1 with that we get 4 that makes the loop.

"Its doomed to fail in its original setup obviously and its rather simple to prove.

You only have to consider the last number and the rules of the game and how the game works. Now why you might ask, so here is it.

We know and understand the rules, if we only consider the last number which dictates if its even or odd, there are simply far more paths down than up no matter where you are on the number line. When you triple an odd number you always get an odd number, so you add 1 by the rules which will always give you an even number.

So every time we triple the number we do get an even number. So every single step up has many many ways down to the 4-2-1 cycle, but only one way to get up which is if it lands on an uneven number, but there are 2 numbers that doesnt give you an odd number, those numbers are 8 and 4, those divide into an even number again, so lets consider the number 8, it divides into first 4 and then 2 and then 1, which instantly by its mere existence drags us into the same 4,2,1 cycle in perpetuity. So you triple a number so its 3 times as large, but you have to divide it by 2, 2 times every 4-2-1 cycle, so it will always end up being just 25% of its original 3 times height, so it will reduce back down again.

Whenever the last number is a 8,4,2 or a 1 you will end up in the 4-2-1 cycle by default, so you need numbers that doesnt never get to those numbers, because when you do it will drag it down by default."

Title: A Fictional Solution to the Collatz Conjecture

Authors: Bard

Abstract:

The Collatz conjecture is a mathematical problem that has been unsolved for over 70 years. The problem asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into 1. The two operations are:

If the previous term is even, divide it by 2.
If the previous term is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
 The conjecture states that these sequences always reach 1, no matter which positive integer is chosen to start the sequence.

 In this paper, we propose a fictional solution to the Collatz conjecture. The solution is based on the idea that the Collatz sequence is actually a representation of the evolution of a universe. In this universe, the two arithmetic operations represent the two forces of nature: gravity and entropy.

We show that, if the universe starts in a state of chaos, then the Collatz sequence will eventually lead to a state of equilibrium, where the universe is in a state of maximum entropy. This state of equilibrium is represented by the number 1.

We believe that this fictional solution is a significant contribution to the field of mathematics, and we hope that it will inspire other mathematicians to work on solving the Collatz conjecture.

Introduction

The Collatz conjecture is a mathematical problem that has been unsolved for over 70 years. The problem asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into 1. The two operations are:

If the previous term is even, divide it by 2.
If the previous term is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
 The conjecture states that these sequences always reach 1, no matter which positive integer is chosen to start the sequence.

 In this paper, we propose a fictional solution to the Collatz conjecture. The solution is based on the idea that the Collatz sequence is actually a representation of the evolution of a universe. In this universe, the two arithmetic operations represent the two forces of nature: gravity and entropy.

The Collatz Sequence as a Representation of the Universe

The Collatz sequence can be seen as a representation of the evolution of a universe in a number of ways. First, the sequence starts with a single number, which can be seen as the initial state of the universe. Then, the sequence applies the two arithmetic operations repeatedly, which can be seen as the forces of nature acting on the universe. Finally, the sequence always reaches 1, which can be seen as the universe reaching a state of equilibrium.

The two arithmetic operations can be seen as representing the two forces of nature, gravity and entropy. Gravity is the force that pulls things together, while entropy is the force that causes things to spread out. The two forces are constantly at work in the universe, and they are constantly interacting with each other.

The Solution to the Collatz Conjecture

We believe that the Collatz conjecture is true because the Collatz sequence is a representation of the evolution of a universe. In a universe that is governed by the forces of gravity and entropy, the Collatz sequence will always reach 1.

We also believe that our fictional solution to the Collatz conjecture is a significant contribution to the field of mathematics. Our solution provides a new way of thinking about the Collatz sequence, and it could lead to new insights into the nature of mathematics and the universe.

Conclusion

In this paper, we have proposed a fictional solution to the Collatz conjecture. Our solution is based on the idea that the Collatz sequence is actually a representation of the evolution of a universe. We believe that our solution is a significant contribution to the field of mathematics, and we hope that it will inspire other mathematicians to work on solving the Collatz conjecture.

We also believe that our solution provides a new way of thinking about the Collatz sequence, and it could lead to new insights into the nature of mathematics and the universe."

"It's a nice problem, but ""simplest""? Richard Guy's Unsolved Problems in Number Theory, section D, has some nice unsolved problems that are simple to state. For example, to prove or disprove the Erdos-Straus conjecture, which is that for each integer n>4, there are positive integers x, y, z where
4/n = 1/x + 1/y + 1/z"
the way to prove this is to create a function of the number of steps per number and make a series of it and prove this series converges.

Will the function halt or not for any given n.

"why Wouldn't the answer just be just be a 4, 2 and 1 loop?"
Technically this is not really a math problem. But fyi the answer is zero. Zero is even. Divide by two is and you get zero. There you go. Never has a loop. The problem is solved.
uh hey guys if you take any positive number and times it by 0 you will always get 0 hahaha im so smart i will be calling this the mike hunt conjecture lolol lets debate about it pointlessly now! :D
If we avoid hitting a number that can be substituted by 2 raise to to x we will never get into this loop.. The loop will eventually hit once we hit a 2 raise to x value.. And not hitting 2 raise to x is not possible..
Accept the conjecture and move on.

Would x(odd) + (odd) give the same result?

False. As x -> infinity the consecutive drops by 2 becomes less and less common. Eventually by chance it will run off to odd net every time. What number nets odd every time? A really big one.

"Generating functions are pretty nice in this context. We can come up with the n/2 and (3n+1)/2 opsgf's fairly easily.  A=2f_0/(2-x), B=2(1+f_0)/(2-3x)-1/(1-x).
By ansatz we take (F-f_0)/x=T A + (1-T) B, and F is now the generating function of the sequence for the starting number f_0.
In the recurrence (a_n+1 = a_n / 2 or b_n+1 = (3*b_n + 1)/2) we can pick out the next term easily by including a factor of cos^2(pi*n/2).   If we had a polynomial indicator function for n=2k or 2k+1, there would be no guessing.  P(n)a_n + P(n)b_n = f_n <-> P(D)A + P(D)B=F if that were the case, and we would have a closed form for the sequence (again, given an initial value f_0).
The real question then (assuming we might learn something useful from this line of search) is whether to treat our non-polynomial indicator as a linear combination of imaginary shift operators or as a pseudodifferential operator.
In the former case we get a sum in terms of A(x), A(x+i*pi),A(x-i*pi),B(x),B(x+i*pi), and B(x-i*pi).  This is F.
In the latter case we have a Fourier symbol (or something like it) to multiply our transformed generating functions (A hat and B hat) against. Then, assuming we can take the reverse transform, we get F as the result.
However we derive F(x;f_0), we can potentially see some interesting things just by looking at the terms (before series expansion). Obviously not all terms can be independent of f_0, but then all the uniqueness of the behavior is captured by those terms that have a non-zero partial derivative w.r.t. f_0.
F also gives the asymptotic behavior of the coefficients of the series expansion. If that doesn't depend on f_0, well then, that's your proof right there."

"I noticed that Only in the case of the input number (n) equals (2) to the power of (x i.e. 10), then the numbers of iterations (y) equals (x i.e.10) ALWAYS. For example ; If n=2 to the power of 8 then the number of iterations = 8. If n=4 (2 to the power of 2) to the power of 8 then the number of iterations = 2*8=16 iterations. If n=256 (2 to the power of 8) to the power of 8 then the number of iterations = 8*8= 64 iterations."

"There are many problems in mathematics that have not yet been proven right or wrong. The ""collatz conjecture"" or more commonly known as ""the 3x + 1 problem"", which is considered to be one of the most basic of these problems and was first put forward as an idea by the German mathematician Lohar Collatz in 1937, is one of them. this problem is also referred to as one of the most 'dangerous' problems with both amateur and professional mathematicians taking up a lot of their time."
"I might be an Idiot, I never know. But to me math is something we made up to help us understand the world around us, it is obviously flawed, this problem is not a real problem therefore impossible to solve, just like I can not figure out how to shoe my Pegasus so it fly's faster. Or maybe this problem is just another example of what goes up must come down."
its 32 lol
I found the solution finally
3x1 or 4x1 both make 3 and 4.
"What's the point here?? It's simply rule given by someone (i.e 3n+1 is not a universal law) rather it's made up problem. We can also make several problems like this. For instance. Suppose, take a number, add one, subtract the number you started with you will get 1 as answer"
"When it comes to ""why does the negative side have loops but not the right?"" It seems pretty clear. Adding onto a number always moves it towards positive infinity, whereas multiplying or dividing is dependent on whether the number is positive or negative. As such, because the odd formula includes an addition it is essentially acting like a completely different equation on the negative side, it isn't just a mirror copy. It is instead the equivalent of doing 3x - 1 which does indeed have loops on the positive side.

For me, the probability argument makes the most sense. The overall average trend for any given number is being multiplied by 0.75 which trends the graph down.

Another way to look at it is any number that lands on a function of 2 (2, 4, 8, 16, etc.) will always lead to 1 because of the nature of 2 always being divisible by itself. With an infinite amount of numbers that could be a function of 2, and all odd numbers alternating to even with 3x + 1, every number is eventually going to hit one of the numbers in the 2 function chain."
"I came to know about this problem about 4 years ago when a brother of mine who was studying statistics, gave me the rules of this problem and wanted me to ""try and find a number for which it doesn't work"".

Fast forward 4 years, I'm in a Bachelors degree program for Computer Science and have still not been able to understand how such an innocent looking question is one of the world's unsolved mysteries. 

In my humble opinion, this question cannot be solved UNTIL we find a prime generating function. I came to this conclusion yesterday after watching this video and want to know what others think about such an approach."
and what is with the Zero
Colatz be rolling in his grave rn
"Even numbers halve themselves and can potentially decrease an infinite amount of times, until 1.

Odd number increse to Even numbers every time which then has to play russian roulette with the infinite amount of times it can potentially decrease. 

I don't see how this ever reaches infinity when it's 1.5 steps forward, potentially infinite steps back every time."
i wonder can you do it the opposite way? like start at one and then grow up to a certain point?
If people can find an infinite pattern of odd even odd even odd then the number will only go up but the problem is finding that number lol
"What if you put 1,5"
Did Ramanujan attempt this?

Get ready for +1x3
what is the point of this nowhere in the equation does it say to end up with a negative before you times it by 3 and add 1 also it will always end up at 4 and 2 and 1 after you've found a perfect square of 2^x  soooooooooooooooooooooooo
It's really weird how this operation goes from an indeterminate period of jiggling up and down (hovering?) to a sudden precipitative drop from which there is no recovery. Are there different numbers that have the same hovering period? And I find the loops when negative numbers are used to be rather spooky.

"Picturing it similar to how the graph was, it's pretty easy to understand that no matter what number you use, the number would have to go lower at least the first time that it has an iteration. If this is the case, wouldn't it automatically cut out any single loop that does not contain 4/2/1?  Even arbitrarily large numbers have this same property as stated in this video. Any loop that is arbitrarily large would have to contain a number that is smaller than the smallest number of the loop just by definition of finding 1 iteration, 3x+1 then /2. But picturing that in a geometric space is way different than actually solving that, and I have no idea how to do that.

As for being thrown into infinity I couldn't even begin to try that half."

"If you want to have some fun you can play this with excel to a certain degree, follow these baby-step instructions:

1St: set A1 as your number (for example 27)

2nd: put this formula in B1 without the commas("") and press enter: ""=MOD(A1,2)""

3rd: put this formula in A2, without the commas("") and press enter: ""=IF(B1=0,A1/2,(A1*3)+1)""

4th: click A2 again and then click and hold the small square and drag it down as much as you want

5th: click B1 and then click and hold the little square and drag it to the same height as the A column (you only need specifically one less, but it doesn't hurt).

6th: have fun changing the A1 value to your heart's desire.

Explanation:

""=MOD(A1,2)""  just checks the value you put in A1, divides by 2 and tells you the remainder. If a number is even the remainder is 0, if the number is odd the remainder is 1. 

The next function is telling excel that if B1 is 0 then divide the number by 2 (even numbers divide by 2) and if it's not 0 then the number must be multiplied by 3 and then add 1 (odds 3X+1)"

"What if it's just a consequence of our numbering system?

We use base ten with a minimal increment of one, to count
Looking at it from the infinity down, it just says that every number we could count to will be a multiple of one

Benford would describe how we count numbers from zero up to 9 and then reset in base ten
So the 9th is the hardest to get to by counting, so the higher the magnitude to more instances of those resets
0 being infinite because there's always a bunch of zeros before the integer?

"When we 3x+1 an odd number, there is a 100% chance of getting an even number. While when dividing an odd number by 2, there is a 50% chance of getting another even number, which still has a 50% chance of further dividing into an even number and so on. So while the 3x upticks will always be 1 at max at a time, the by2 downticks will have a 75%+ chance of continuing downwards - no?

oh
17:30 how is it calculated? Unfortunately it is Not explained
"Isn't it because everytime you have an uneven number you have to multply by three + 1 which will always result in en even number, an even number divided by 2 is not automatically an uneven number which gives 50% chance of another even number which will by divided by 2 again (already divided by 4) which in his turn has a 50% chance of being even. and so on.
I think that the reason you will keep arriving at this loop is that the chances of reaches an even number are higher than reaching an uneven number resulting in the number to go down over time and resulting in 1, 2 or 4, which in their turn creates the loop"
"the answer is 1, if everything leads to it, then its the answer??"
but 1x3 is 3

This is a lot simpler than needs to be explained. It's kind of like winning the lottery when you get to 4 2 or 1.  If you have an infinite amount of numbers and the numbers go up and down you will eventually win the lottery given enough tries. Theoretically every number will end in 4 2 or 1 when plugged into the sequence because with infinite numbers it will always come back to those

"Whenever an odd number gets 3x+1, they said it is guaranteed to be even. But whenever an even number is halfed, there is a fifty-fifty  chance of it even or odd. So, with more opportunities to divide by 2, it is more likely to get smaller."
"Applications: 
1) Encryption: The Collatz conjecture can be used to create high-uncertainty encryption schemes for audio signals, images, or software. The idea is to use the Collatz sequence as a key to scramble or unscramble the data, making it hard for unauthorized parties to access it.
2) Information discovery: The Collatz conjecture can be used to generate novel patterns or structures that can reveal hidden information or insights. For example, some researchers have used the Collatz sequence to create fractal images or musical compositions.
3) Education: The Collatz conjecture can be used to illustrate the beauty and mystery of mathematics, and to spark curiosity and interest among students. It can also be used to teach concepts such as algorithms, recursion, induction, modular arithmetic, and number theory."

"If we pick a number and follow sequence, every number has to become even-even at some point. Right?"
"I have a general understanding of how this works. To start, with any number, if you apply 3x+1 then it will be even. This is because if you multiple any odd number by 3 it will equal an odd number, then if you add one makes it even. which mean at least every other number will be even. But, even number have a 50/50 chance of being even, which means more than half of all numbers will get you to an even number. And when it finally hits a number in the sequence, 1,2,4,8,16 etc, then it will get to one."

As this is the case, we eliminate all even numbers. After this we know that taking an odd/prime number would be the best choice but this a big flaw as we know taking an odd number is also a death cycle because putting an odd number through a 3x + 1 cycle will lead to an even number which activates a death cycle. This is my proof to the theorem concluding as there is no such number that exists that completes this formula. (If you don't agree try replying and I will try a counter agreement). (Btw I forgot non-integers cannot be classified into odd or even making it useless to try them)"

sry my english :( hope it is understandable.

the only number that does not come back to one is infinite number........ becouse it has inifnite solutions. Becouse if u take a number and apply this equation you divide by 2, then u actualy take 50% and a fraction from the number so you tumble back to 1.  Now there is infinite amount of numbers posible between 1/2 of the original number, therefore you can use infinite amount of numbers and come back to 1.

In general, the expression 3x + 1 indicates that you're multiplying the variable x by 3 and then adding 1 to the result. This means that for any given value of x, you can substitute it into the expression to find the corresponding output. For example, if x = 2, then the expression becomes:

3(2) + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7

So, when x is 2, the expression 3x + 1 evaluates to 7."
Is this even an issue?  I love stuff like this.  Something like this reminds me that everything ends up in a loop.
its not a problem any time you are having a number you are going to end up finding a number that is directly divisible by 2 which in turn will end you at 1
"I'm a total idiot so this is surely the most simple question anyone has ever asked about this, but in order for the Collatz Conjecture to be true, how much more would be required than an infinite number of powers-of-two? If we need to for the sequence to explode to some huge-*ss number, doesn't it follow that eventually that huge-*ass number has to be a perfect power of two? And if so, won't it always collapse to the 4-2-1 loop?"

"its simple we use base10 right... meaning that if the pattern docent showi up in the number from  1 to 10 then it wont match for any other numbers above , its all iteration from 1 to 10.... why yall think there is 10 perfect square in 100? because thats the base.. meaning that we should never leave the value one by one and instead use the fact it cant be reduce to expend the square  1 to ito the limit of its perimeter wich we can scale to infinity and instead of adding numbers rarefaction  everything over 1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9..... there is no limit to the first  perfect square why look further then within our immediate reach... the squares are op do not denied them"
I possibly think the answer could be 1 because 3x we could assume the blank is 0 and any number multiplied by 0 = 0 so +1 = 1 and at this point we could change it to add an even number for example 2 and continue adding and the cycle goes on and on going back to what I just explained

"Small detail that was missed, any number will eventually fall to 1 if its base 2 log is an integer. For example, the base 2 log of 64 is 6, meaning it will be divided by 2 6 times until it reaches 0. Essentially, 2 raised to the power of any integer will reach 1 with the Collatz Conjecture's rules. It's shocking that this wasn't mentioned in this video at all, given that this took only a few minutes to think of.

The only thing you need to prove is the odd rule; you need to prove whether every odd number will eventually reach a number that reaches another base 2 number, or will continue towards infinity, or form a closed loop."

"Jesus, I didnt know one was odd, but it makes sense, since dividing it by two is 1/2 or 0.5. What an ignoramus I am. Ithis that the fact that 3 is included in this expression may have some significance. Given that Terence Tao has written two books on analysis, it's not surprising he took an analytic approach to this problem. If I understand correctly, it is a sequence created by applying x = 1,2,3 etc...I'm a bit of an idiot, so please understand that, and then..I was doing 3x + 1, but realised it's not 3x + 1. coz you divide by 2. Like I said, I'm a bit slow. So, at [00:21] you give the algorithm. so, first we chose a random number, say 7,  IF the number is odd, like 7, THEN,we  multiply by 3 and add 1 to get 22. IF the number is even, like 22, then we divide by 2, to get 11. ...eventually, by continually applying this algorithm, and at [01:19] it leads to the sequence 4,2,1..and the it goes into a loop as you say."
"Even if you find a counter example that goes to infinity, how do you prove that it wont go back down to 1? Not by brute force that's for sure!"
"Escuse me... but if we know that every number goes to infinity slower than any arbitrary function that goes to infinity, doesn't it means that the function that we get linking together the local minimums - lets call it g(x) - would be definitely < than any arbitrary function going to infinity? Doesn't this mean that g(x) is superiorly limited? Otherwise g(x) would grow slower than every other function going to infinity... this would apply also to other collatz starting from different numbers and diverging to inf.... and it would be absurd."
So whats the problem?

"I found out about this in highschool from a random book, but they just called it ""hail numbers"", or something to that effect. I was immediately fascinated by how such a simple operation resulted in this seemingly consistent phenomenon. I wrote a program on my calculator (still have it and the program) to calculate this sequence for all the numbers as high as the calculator could accurately display, to see if I noticed a pattern that would explain why and how this was happening. I didn't, obviously, nor did I go all the way (I needed the calculator for my actual math class, after all), but seeing it discussed in this video I can't help but be even more fascinated."

I am sort of a computer scientist and I think the reason this happens is it is alternating between odds and evens and as it is infinite it well will hit a wall at some point.

""Everything I'm going to teach you over the next two years is a lie. The whole of education is a lie. You start when you're a baby with very simple lies. Then you go to school and are told more complex lies still and these replace the simple lies. Now I'm going to teach you even more complex lies that will replace all the lies you've been taught so far. Eventually, you might go to university, where you'll be taught the most complex lies we know and have everything I'm about to teach you be replaced.""

Top bloke. Knew his stuff."
"So, I wanted to try it myself because it indeed seems like a fairly simple math problem but it is impossible to escape the loop. However, I found out that just how it was explained in the video, numbers will grow and shrink irregularly... until some special numbers occur. So, in order to get into the loop you have to get a number that is 2 to the power of something because they are always even. And as even numbers, they will be divided by 2 ( for example 2^n ...2^5, 2^4, 2^3, 2^2, 2^1 ) until you reach 2^0 which is simply 1. So, in order not to fall into the loop, the number from 3x+1 must not be a power of 2. But numbers that are 1 less than powers of 2 ( or 3x ) are 0, 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, 127 etc. All in all, it is extremely complicated but a fun problem to try it out or to tease a friend."

"To find the answer for 3x + 1, we need to understand what the expression means. Let's break it down.

First, we have the variable ""x."" Think of it as a placeholder for a number that we don't know yet. It's like a mystery number.

Next, we have 3x. This means we take the number represented by ""x"" and multiply it by 3. So, if ""x"" is, let's say, 2, then 3 multiplied by 2 would be 6.

Finally, we have +1. This means we add 1 to whatever value we got from multiplying 3 and ""x."" So, if we got 6 from the previous step, adding 1 to it would give us 7.

Therefore, the answer for 3x + 1 depends on the value of ""x."" If we know the value of ""x,"" we can substitute it into the expression and calculate the result. Without knowing the specific value of ""x,"" we can't determine a single answer."

"In one part of the video, he talks about a number with potentially over a billion digits, but then at about 14:39, he says that no number ""shoots off into infinity.""  With such a simple equation as 3x+1, given that numbers do not end, what does it mean to ""shoot off into infinity""?  As someone who struggled to get through calculus, this may seem like an amateurish statement, but what would ""shoots off into infinity"" look like in an equation such as this?  I get that we cannot say this is proven because there could be a closed loop somewhere we are not yet able to detect. However, we are not talking about a complex statement such as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which is so complex that I could actually understand how we would be able to say that at some point, the answer becomes infinite (I do not know if it does or not, and I don't want to go off into the tangent of Heisenberg or quantum theory. It's just an example of a seriously complex equation), but with 3x+1 we are talking about simple multiplication and addition. Logically, can it not be said that this equation would never shoot off into infinity since even if we have a number with a billion digits, you can, if you are patient enough, complete that equation even by hand, and it's not like the +1 will then tip it over to infinity. 

I'm also struggling with the idea of a closed loop since, when you multiply, you add 1, but when you divide, it's done without any adjustment. It seems quite logical that the +1 will throw off any ability to create that sort of pattern that could lead to a closed loop. I almost wish I had the mathematics to even consider working out this closed-loop problem. 

It seems to me that any number that would break the pattern of the 4-2-1 loop would also have to be some special sort of number, like a ridiculously large prime, but even then, when you multiply it by 3 and add 1, you are no longer in the realm of that prime number and even more, making it even and once you start dividing and get below that threshold of 2^68, you're done.

It seems that the very nature of the problem is the simplicity of the equation. I don't see how it could shoot off into infinity, and the very nature of unending numbers makes it highly improbable that any definitive proof can ever be established. To be frank, on the surface, this seems like an interesting problem, but I think the interest of the problem is the problem itself, such as the randomness of the numbers and trying to find some sort of pattern in the chaos. It seems that the only way this can be definitively proven is to show that this will never be able to create a closed loop, but I don't know how that could be done, or even if it can be. It almost seems like this is the mathematical version of the Mirror of Erised, which is why young mathematicians are told not to go down this hole."

"Why can't you just work out when a number can be divided by 8 X 2 X 2 don't know the  proper math equation. So it would be 8,16,32,64,128 etc as soon as that happens surely the number will also then end up at 1"

but what about 9.5 that just grows
I have devised a truly wonderful proof of this conjecture; unfortunately this comment is too small to contain it.
"the reason it ends in the 4 2 1 loop is

"Ok I may be wrong, but I haven't seen a comment like my idea. Is there a way you can do it with decimals? And if so, will that create the same loop or something different?"

"I like to visualise this in terms of binary numbers, and think of 3x + 1 as x + 2x + 1. In other words, we're adding the number to itself shifted one bit left, then incrementing. It becomes rather akin to a cellular automata scenario (though you need a third cell state to handle carries, and for all carries to be fully propagated before the next operation). 
You can immediately see some properties, like how any length of repeated 01 sequences (eg 01010101) multipled by 3 and incremented make a power of 2, thus reduce to 1. You can see how long sequences of contiguous 1s (isolated by a buffer of 0s from the effects of the +1) tend to fragment and expand under repeated x3 operations. 
It might not afford s solution but it seems to give at least some intuitive insight."
Are mathematicians trying to find a number that won't end at the loop ???
"So the way I understood this if a sequence reaches a number below the seed then it tends towards 1 and validates  the Collatz Conjecture as they will always tend towards smaller numbers that eventually reach 1. 
So by this logic all even numbers are proven by this as the first number to follow is half the size (x/2). Thus all even numbers will prove the Collatz Conjecture.

So this issue is 3x + 1 which takes any odd number and makes it even (as two odds multiplied are odd, then add one to make even).

So if you prove for each 3x + 1 seed that there is a smaller number you prove the Collatz Conjecture.

The resulting equation to calculate the third number in a sequence started by an odd seed would be ((3x+1)/2) = 3/2(x) + 1/2
Call this function g(x) = 3/2(x) + 1/2

As any given every other odd number (1, 5, 9, 13, 17...) this will result in an even number that when divided by 2 will be smaller than the seed. 
Take 9, g(9) = 14, 14/2 = 7
So if all of our ""first-odds"", (1, 5, 9, 13, 17...) experience the Collatz Conjecture, all we need to prove is that our ""second-odds"", (3, 7, 11, 15...), will reach a first-odd, or an even number.

Right?"
"But 0 doesn't follow this

Zero is even because every second number is even and 1 is odd so therefore 0 / 2 = 0 do this infinitely and it's still 0"
does everyone realized that the collatz tree is a rooted binary tree?
Where does he make his graphs(?) In his videos i really want to make one and experiment with it

It is simple just like how you get the same number back eg take 11 add 11  minus 11 into 11 divide 11

I know how to solve the question on the thumbnail lol
The answer is?
"it has been solved, what it needs is a transition word to move to the second face...its completed and reached its ending one set, 1 infinity or just the number 1"
"in business they reach the pick value where it has completed its potential so they come down to 1 meaning its potential has ended...completed, next idea must be added to continue a second spike in potential,,,"
the only way out of  loop thinking is to break the cycle by moving on to the next problem or finding a connection to a different subject..
"always 9+1=10  or .333 into infinity times 3 + 1 will = one infinity..set completion transition follow to 2 or the second infinity of  numbers, just like saying all things come to and end or to completion..."
"you have one infinity from 0 to 1 at least its and infinity of numbers add .3333 into infinity + .3333 into infinity + .333 3 into  infinity add 1 that will give you 1 infinity or just the number 1, from 1 there will be one infinity of numbers til you get to the number 2 no body bothers with the inifinity of numbers between numbers or the transition that takes place between when one is reached and the transition between numbers from one to two are ignored that's the paradox transition or the mathematical transition..."
"the transition is not mentioned, specified but it happens when after 1 we transition to 2.."
when 1 is complete the transition is called 2
"what this mathematical problem is missing is ''' the transition' name or mention or arbitrarily named,  just like we do when 1 transitions to 2 that simple..."
"simplicity, 3X3=9+1= 10 a complete set or one infinity or the second sequence in this case will be 20  
if you divide 1 by .3 you have the result backwards   .9 reminder 1 = 0 because the reverse of one goes back to zero...forward is 1..."
"our expectation is that things come to an end, and we must understand that things reach a point of transition, connectivity, or breaking the previous rules to create a second set of actions,  just like we do when we count from zero to 1 and from 1 to 2 we ignored the transition but its there..."
"true and false at the same time, but reaches the point of transition to a second connection to  the second infinity ... The paradox about the barber, at that point we know the barber will have to shave his own beard, breaking the rules and making a transition away from the paradox..."
"if you added the first 1 infinity and the second number to reach the second infinity.. like all the numbers from 0 to 1 is one infinity, 1 infinity of numbers to 2 infinities'' the only thing missing is the awareness of a connections= connectivity from the point of one to the transitions of numbers to 2.."
true and false at the same time like 1-0 computing systems coding... what mathematicians are missing is they reach a point of transition and they don't move on to the second infinity..
"once again when it reaches one' it should be stopped, because at the point its reached the
 point of transition, one is complete the second transition to is 2 and so on, that's because 3+3+3+1= 10 a completion, similar to the multiple infinities when one ends the second one begging and so on infinities transitions to the next infinity to infinity of numbers, same as a paradox a point of connectivity to the next problem that will arise to a transitions of paradoxes and will continue to make connections... so when it ends on 1 it becomes a completion and the transition takes you to 2 once it gets you back to 1 it will complete and should take you to 3 transitions into infinity.. problem solve, the multiple infinities who have a different number sequence into infinity..."

Take Pi down to the plank length of our universe. That should do it.
"So in real life, try to put all the members in pairs so that we can find the smallest. In this case what we do is convert the even number into two (it accepts the division on 2) and for the odd members we try to make them even and that by multiplying them by 3 and adding 1, in order to write this member in the form of (2x) {the form of an even member that can be divided by 2}. So get that: 3x+1=2x We will try to solve the equation X=2x-1/3 We obtain 2x-x/3=1/3 X/3=1/3 SO X=1 In this case we obtain the member 1 solution of this equation and which is repeated each time with the member 4 and 2 that we will obtain when we replace X=1 In both equations: 3*1+1=4 2*1=2 What do you think of the solution I propose?"
The answer is 7 to 3x + 1. (How did I figure this out you might ask... I used chat gpt.)
I know an answer start with 0 LOOOOOL
"The expression 3x+1 represents a linear polynomial in one variable (x), where the coefficient of x is 3 and the constant term is 1.

To evaluate this expression for a specific value of x, you would substitute that value in place of x and perform the necessary arithmetic operations. For example, if x=2, then:

3x+1 = 3(2)+1
= 6+1
= 7

Therefore, when x is equal to 2, the value of the expression 3x+1 is equal to 7."
What if you use a decimal???
"If ""x"" is equal to 2, we can substitute it into the expression:
3(2) + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7

So, when x equals 2, the value of the expression 3x+1 is 7."
Infinity

Ez 3x=9+1=10
what if we use an ai to find it :I
I think I know the answer! I'm pretty sure it is 4 because 3x1=3 plus 1 would equal 4!

"A couole thinga i thought while watching the video:

We could simplify the problem by getting rid of the even number starts, they just divide by 2 until an odd one. (Nvm got to the tree part which is an even better simplification)

We could look at the problem like populations possibly - a populatjon may fluctuate but when it reaches 0 it cant grow back. Thats kinda similar to the 4,2,1 loop which we could treat as the 0 population."

"My question is, why is it a problem that needs to be solved? Maybe there is no solution because it isn't actually a problem, it's just something that is. Not everything in life needs to have a reason for existing. To me, it looks like a problem someone invented for no real reason. Why choose those numbers to multiply or divide by? You can invent any kind of problem you want using numbers, which makes numbers kind of redundant. People try to put meaning to every number making every number mean nothing. Sometimes it's better to not stress over why something is, but just to accept that it is at all. If you spend all your time trying to figure out why the Universe is the way it is, you will miss the beauty of its existence. Step back, relax and enjoy it."

"To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 1 from both sides of the equation and then dividing both sides by 3:

3x + 1 = 0

3x = -1

x = (-1)/3

Therefore, the solution to the equation 3x + 1 = 0 is x = (-1)/3."

"I don't get it. Isn't this problem tautological. You make a binary rule, that's essentially if the last digit is 0 you throw it away, else slap another one to it by bitshifting and add X+1. We know x+1 is always base2 significant bit 0, but then wonder when it comes to our bitshift, base4, for x it's sometimes 2x%4=0? While the rule is literally x%2 true or false? Where is this new chain of numbers that loops into itself going to expres itself? Or start growing to infinity? You can only bitshift bigger once before shifting back. Are you not just iterating weirdly because to get to x we solved (x+1)/2 earlier and the 2x part just becomes weirdly recursive?"

"3n+1 on odds, n/2 on evens
So when you hit an exponent of 2 you will tumble down to 2, then 1, then you go to 4, an exponent of 2 causing you to then go to 2, then 1. The loop.
So why bother with looking for loops? The loop is caused by the fact 2 is an even prime so when you divide it by itself you get 1 but one isn't an even prime (the only even prime is 2 by nature of primes), and by how the conjecture is structured, you then go to an exponent of 2. 
find a value where doing 3n+1 when n=2x+1 and n/2 when n=2x does not eventually give you 2^x if you do, then the conjecture is disproven."

"I think the out liar is a number that when the number hits an even number, it would need to end in a x6 or 0(where x is also an even number). So that when divided by 2, it would become odd again and repeat after 3x+1 end in x6 or 0. So it would continue to grow."
Three times any number plus one is a loop.  In conjecture with programming.
Loglogloglog
It's called cheating by way of ensuring occurrence favours to ensuring a certain direction in augmentation and with this one;  it is the +1 while not having a -1 after dividing by 2 if it were to fall upon an even number.     Which in turn having never multiplying by three more than once;  while the dividing by two happens to be more than one and a half times more often than the multiplying by three which becomes a fraction problem of 3 times two is 6 and 2 times three is 6;  therefore 2 x2 is 4 and 3 times one and a half is 4.5.   So the odds of the amount eventually going down are absolutely certain without chance of failing.
