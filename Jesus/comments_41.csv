Why have stupid hard coded subs ruin the video?
"5:07 was cold, deliberately cropping the top half of the leaders out."
nothing surprising here at all; all carefully choreographed by the NK officials.
3:06 is that Mickey Mouse on the left?
"""When there's a lot of limitations, I like it because you have to have more creativity, you have to work harder to make good pictures"" - 
those are the words of a true artist"
Wow fear really does control people.
No one that visits North Korea believes anything they are ALLOWED to see or visit.
Bow? Bow to a terrorist criminal pervert? No. I don't think so.
America is watching and taking notes on how to completely oppress and subjugate imprison their population.
North Korea is your typical NWO police state model.
I would never go there. Better die with your birthrights than live a day without them.
The logical and inexorable end point of socialism.  The only way to avoid it is to never step onto that road.
"the model for the WEF ""great reset"".."
I wish to live in there
I'm not talking to you directly until you make me a diplomat so I'm going to stay quiet and I'm going to fight the good fight and I'm going to end up caving in and calling you back I can't play hardball with you
Let's try to rise above the rhetoric and all the distractions if our enemies are drained financially they can no longer be a threat
I'm speaking through you not to you reading between the lines you know what I'm saying
I think the best approach is hybrid economics cooperation building projects...
Please feel free to share with our partner to the northnortheast
I'm very interested in the way Singapore is designed as you are and your brother is also Macau in China the architecture is beautiful reminds me a lot of Pyongyang downtown
"Circling back to my plead for mutual respect of sovereignty, I would never create a situation in which I created dishonor because the outcome is certain..both you know I wouldn't shoot. And you would underestimate the future because I have two Hiers and a world empire at their disposal."
Enter gif we are conveying a sense of thought not a direct translation
I have to change my syntax to be decipher
One less bridge needs to be crossed
Mutual respect I authorize you to pull my photos if you'd like to prop up my bank account do whatever you like however please respect my nation sovereignty
Never underestimate the best you're very extraordinary both of you carry on the fight
If I may be so bold I researched your upbringing educated in Switzerland so you're fluent in English
Lol... In this video they have always showed the cropped pics of the leaders as if it would be on purpose
It's always humorous that NK tries to impress with things the Western democracies have had for 100 years.
"1:58, God said do not worship the Gods of Baal (Kim II sung ) & Asherah (Kim Jong II),  even not to mention their names, let alone place flowers & bow to them."
"Call it was it is, a prison you cannot leave, without the guards permission"
The tyranny government and slave people
"this is communism. to all the idiots who want this in beautiful america, you have never lived i soviet russia or north korea or purto rico"
"I love this guys perspective, he is not biased or trying to inflict his opinions on anyone he is just documenting and that is so beautiful what a wonderful man"
Imagine dropping down you pants and taking a dump big steaming turd rite in front of the statue
"At 3:01, you can see Mickey Mouse on the wall. I didn't expect that -I had to pause the video and zoom in to make sure that's really what I was seeing. It's strange to see an American icon in North Korea."
BBC! Everything outside...!
This guy is sick. He is making excuses for all the injustices. He even says he likes it. What is going on?!?
"Korean  bible App

The Koreans shaved up their microphones up his butt that even now they have a feedback from the dude ...
"3:08

North Korea: We ban foreign stuff 
Random Mickey Mouse Sticker: ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?"
Cm lah kim jong un tu tuhan eiii nahh tumbuk hang baru tau gemuk sja dia sna
"He said he likes being totally surrounded by ""guides"" ""feeling embedded""? For real, try doing that  for years!?!?!"
"I think the driver wasnt really lost, i think that was his way of getting you more content and a great way to look and play dumb to your advisors who probably were lost or doing the same thing. Or wernt wise to him. Playing confused is a great card to play."
"I wish there was more, he is a good story teller."
Marvellous photos
This is called Democrat Heaven.
"Fine explanation from him, but I do not see anything interesting in these photos. Same typical N Korean photos, nothing special at all. Same spirit of poor gloomy existence of locals. Fantasy land, yes, but full of propaganda, absurd and hopelessness. Misery land from nightmare."
"China supports North Korea. 
Citizens escape from Nk but China searches for them and captures them and sends them back to NK so they can die. Instead of helping them escape, China makes NK happy. How sad"
Pictures of North Korea give me depression
AGAIN!!!??????????????
1:54 is a stunning image
"Everything nice you see in North Korea is nothing but an illusion, just a show.

Never forget that."
Luck he got out
Imagine the surveillance in your room while staying there. You know it has be big time bugged.
"UK has a housing crises, NK looks like everyone is housed."
"The rule was when taking pictures with the leaders involved you have to show the full statute. It was never stated they have to be clearly shown and in this photographer's photos you can see all the body parts so he did follow the rules, he never cropped a picture. 

Also I'm so thankful for being an American. Not play into the stereotype but north Korea definitely seems like a hole lot worse. I know people are tired of hearing this but this is what we'll get if America becomes a communist country, plain and simple. There would be no doing things that you want to do. No matter what the riche will always get richer and the poor will always be poorer because that what happens to people with power."
Tell me you are narcissist without telling me basically sums up the leader
notrh
lol bbc
its so scary and creepy and unsettling yet i cant look away its like a dreamcore
trying to be so utopian
what is dystopian world its like a psychological thriller movie
wtf this is terrifying
this is so scary
He got homesick it was so different

wants suprising
Those photos weren't surprising at all. It's just regime propaganda
"A bleak, depressing, horrible country, whose oppressed people are ruled over by a self serving, tyrannical family dynasty.  Why any foreigner would wish to visit North Korea is beyond me."
"Welp... driver and his entire family, -oh and his 3 generation (his father's, him, son's family) will be punished or worst"
Now here is a people in desperate need of being liberated from a psychopathic goverment
I want kim jong un to discipline my own country men and women PHILIPPINES. Philippines want him badly
U mostly saw what they wanted u to see
Really interesting pictures. Makes it all look so unreal.
"Everything ""positive"" about Socialism and Communism is pure propaganda."
Is it weird that I like to see the more the poor and rural part of North Korea? I kinnda simpathise with them and even wish to join them sometime. Pyongyang is way too overrated.
The loud voice on speaker only 1 time in morning in North Korea and it's only last few minutes but loud voice on speakers in Muslim country such as Indonesia is 5 times a day and it's lasted hour for Shubuh and Ashar. I wish for a law that could control them to respect silence too.
Do they enjoy living in there?
I thought videos of all the surprising images from North Korea were all done already????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
idc cope
A picture what is showing nature in a swimming pool and this is a propaganda to BBC. Seriously? Fu*k!
"When I looked at the swimming pool, it was as if the pool was a part of the whole painting itself"
there's nothing 'surprising' here. Clickbait
Its so sad that their society is not developed even in 20th century like most of them might not know that their species once were landed in the moon which they see on every night
It's was sooo depressing....  Y a person likes to harass and trouble normal people....which parents would tech their kids to be a dictator... And yes his parents where troublemaker so does he... Sad NK
Poor souls are just trapped in a Genjutsu.
"I lkke when he said politely... ""By accident"" on 1:11"
This man is absolutely INSANE n even more lucky to have made it out of that joint!!
I think I'm starting to believe that North Korea is a one big simulation of how it feels like living in a simulation
"In visiting Archangelsk in 1988 we weren't allowed ashore without commissar,and were taken to a visitor centre and given a load of printed propaganda, and were also treated to a buffet of sorts and had to watch a folk dance in costume by local school. As we were just lowly deck crew , we did feel awkward that this was all enforced by politics, and were happier chatting to any locals who could speak English, I did attempt to learn a little Russian also .Politics apart , people are the same everywhere. Pity we can't choose our leaders better...."
Guys the truth is that north korea doesn't exist it's all Chinese propoganda
I think this is the strangest place on the earh to live
0:30 looks like london's council estates
"I feel bad for those people. For all their lives they were brainwashed and forced to praise a single man who only cares for his own vanity. Some of them might know the evil deeds of their leader, yet sharing them might lead to death."
I wonder how long it will take North Korea to realize that they're not communists...
Legends say that the driver is still lost until this day
Therefore I've never seen the disabled people there...
Why the hell would you want to go visit N.  Korea??
For the performers that perform for the tourists they have to do it perfect or risk getting thrown into prison camps speaking of these camps this is where all the punks criminals in the US that rob steal kill take advantage of innocent people are the ones that truly belong in the the true Hell of North Korea prison camps
Crazy rules! I couldn't bear...
Damn.  He's speaking in parables.
"At 3:07, is that Minnie Mouse on the left side of the screen?"
Nuke it or God will
"this is the most regulated country and so beautiful, I wish Kim kidnappeds me and takes me there."
You gotta be a bit masochistic to love living under a totalitarian rule. Then again you can't decide where you are born and North Koreans aren't born with much choice to cope with their situation.
Paradise for obedient loyal serfs who want to serve and die for their master.
I would have just been crapping my pants through every exchange.
"Every North Korea video: Can not crop leaders
Video 5:02 : Proceeds to crop the leaders"
"Given that I don't believe in American propaganda in relation to North Korea; being followed, controlled and not being able to go where you want freely is an evident and significant sign of a repressive and totalitarian regime. Whoever says that he likes to be always controlled and followed after all, is a person who inherently admits that he is ready to become a servant of a regime. This video seems pre-built and provides an idyllic version of reality and collides with videos shot covertly and showing very different views. The statues and the flowers at their feet are, especially if everywhere, unmistakable signs of the cult of personality. A cult which, even if it also works in democratic systems, is above all knowingly cultivated in totalitarian regimes."
"Bruh lies , u should see jaka parker videos about dprk"
Amazing photos!

"Horrible freaks.. when ll androids appears on there, then ll end these grisly days. poor brainwasheds.."

mosaic depicting bathing people is propaganda
why like this ?
Propaganda
At the end of the day they collect all those flowers laid at the statues and resell them all over again the next day. Learned this on another vdo
Cap. Period.
So he was laughing while talk about North Korea? Does he even care about how these people are suffering?
Absolutely nothing surprising
Rocket Man and his cronies have the people brainwashed.
"North Korea, the Dictatorship of one of the most Dangerous Psychopathic Leader on planet Earth! Let's sympathize with this people abuse for too long!"
"Just like most people have said in the comments, it's truly terrifying just how much this guy is restricted; his movements, the way he talks... even the fact there are (and I heavily quote), ""no hidden cameras or microphones in the room"" is greatly concerning.

The way North Korea's leaders 'lead' their people, is precisely the future Conservatives want for the world, but a bit more extreme when it concerns women. North Korea is just one example of a 'progressing' Republican Utopia. Just like Islam."
This photographer is 20 years old after stayed 60days there :)
I hope North Koreans get their freedom
You mention that you can't crop a picture of leaders... Then what is in the end?? Those two leaders looks same as the one with 200 students
Did he get to enjoy time with one of the beautiful Korean ladies?
"everyone reacting to super strict and pro communism country as if they dont understand what those terms mean
yes its living hell for north korea citizen but it got nothin to do with western citizen and yet you guys were talkin as if theyre hurtin you, china got same treatment as well"
Which of these pictures are surprising
"Entire n korea is squid game... imagine ur self being a slave... pity north korean public or they r happy. 
Imagine Black Pink in your area would not exist if they were from nkorea... they would be Kims personal stuff... hyundai, samsung non existant."
good job paying money to dictators making their life better stop traveling to that country leaving your cash there not to mention you have to bow to two previous dictators statues and leave flowers there like wtf?
visiting North Korea is not for me... lol
I want a bbc documentary on harassment of woman and the butchering of human rights in a Sharia governed/islamic country
most useless video ever
This guy likes North Korea. What a strange man
"West will never stop Propoganding agnst countries who dare them. Everyone will not bow to u. Countries like us, France india r joke in the name of democracy."
JAI hind
"Someone needs to make a program in a canon or whatever photocamera to - if you press shoot button while holding another button, the picture gets saved in a secret archive in the memory stick that can`t be openened without a password, but if North Coreans open that folder / archive named - canon setup , it will show like ERROR 560, Can`t Acess The Drive, but when that text is present you need to type in the correct password and it will open the folder with all the secret pictures you have been taking :D"
They have Satellites then can get all these images
"No litter, no graffiti, no vandalism etc. I can see the attraction."
"What will you do!  If West and it's allies keep on testing someone sovereign, threatening sanction with their own lies, ??"
HELL
When you view this it's almost like making first contact with an alien (other planet) civilization.  It's strained & ultra sensitive. This man wants to converse with a civilization bound & wound up in fear. It is perhaps more of an expose not so much in his pictures but in his terse words.  Read between the lines of his words and that is the real picture. Brilliant job.
"the driver did not take a wrong turn on accident.

he did not."
I had a feeling that people are fascinated about those pictures like they were from some other planet.
Only a commie minded can talk like this guy.  Takes a commie to speak highly of another commie.
North Korea is best Korea #1
"""You're not allowed to crop the picture of the leader""
5:01 **proceeds to do that**"
@3:01 - Isn't that picture of Mickey Mouse exposing the North Korean people to American Imperialism?
Liberation for north korea
Has anybody noticed? Kim jong un is the only fat person in North Korea.
AMERICAN EMPERIALIST PROPAGANDA LMAO
I retired there from the US its great!
Yo this city is more soviet looking than the word Soviet exudes. More brutalistic than the definition of brutalism.
"When people complain about the United States and all of the freedoms it gives us, all they need to do is watch this video to be reminded just how lucky we ALL are to have been born here."
I will be very happy never to get within a thousand miles of that wretched police state for the rest of my life.
"Every country has rich places and poor places. So is the USA and so is North Korea. However, the distribution is uneven. In North Korea, only people belonging to the ""elite"" class live well, have access to use the electricity and clean water, eat delicious food, and these people often have relationships with government officials and employees. , just as they are often around the capital, Pyongyang. If life in North Korea is really great, then Park Yeon Mi, or some officials or some soldiers there have no need to defect. I think except for a very few crazy people who believe that perfect heaven is real, no one is stupid enough to leave their hometown if it's a wonderful place."
i saw quite a few vloggers footage from this country and though i believe they have been followed and maybe their recordings checked it was nothing as dark and super restricted as what this guy describe.
This shows how fcked up politics really is. Absolutely disgusting.
"I'm thinking about the picture painted by our western media. Then, I look at these photos of the city with relatively modern design and infrastructure ... the people (even those in the paddy field) wearing very decent clothing, looking fitter and healthier than the average American.

Yes, this might be the 'showpiece' of the country, but how do they build this infrastructure ... how do they develop weapon technology ... how do they build nuclear devices that scare the hell outta the yanks ... if they're mostly just starving peasants? 

Something just doesn't add up in the American wet-dream."
"What is he saying at the end, exactly: He's doctored some of the images to create his own narrative?"
"So basically you were a prisioner tourist. Interesting. I cannot judge them, there's also alot of crap in the so called ""free world"". Anyway : Interesting to learn about other cultures."
"yall, look up jaka parker's videos. he actually lived there as a diplomat with his family . it is still extreme but not like this. the comments here a f'ing weird."
Only a person from a free first world country would say that he likes the oppression because it makes him work harder. Jesus dude.
"OMG ,.North Korea is so sad,.. there is mass poverty, sadness, disease, overcrowded, polluted,.. such a horrible despotic nation ,..if it gets much worse there,..its gonna get almost as bad as California,.."
"This is so disgusting.  Just shows you how low humans can be.  This is what liberals want.  Total control over people.  Now of course they don't want conservative total control, just their total control.  So disgusting how humans can be.  These people that try and enslave people have no right to live."
"I really appreciate how he was not making any judgements on the North Korean society, he was just doing his job as a photographer."
This real channel is saying that other channels of BBC are not real. Probably most of BBC are not real.
"1:35, damn, I would have a field day in there, all those women in pantyhose and heels are yummy territory for me!"
"pastels, the color of tyranny,  huge in fascist north america... oh boy"
North Korean leaders have made themselves gods
"The picture of the kid looking back, are you sure that didn't lead to their harm?"
"4:18 4 women water skiing with SMILING faces = propoganda-type, what a champ!"
Not sure why there's subtitles
Useless as only the BBC can do
Pretty crap photos tbh
"This (in)human nightmare is sponsored by China, my friends."
"Everything they show you is staged, and the tourists always seem to buy it.  Like the time they went for a walk in the woods and a totally impromptu group of perfectly groomed school children appeared out of nowhere on a picnic.  Your driver knew exactly where he was going and you got shown what they *wanted* you to see."
It's like living in prison with services
I'm surprised he was allowed to keep and show the photos of the countryside considering they have to be approved and he wasn't supposed to go there.
It's terrible that people still have to live like this and what makes it worse is that they have no idea that they shouldn't be living like that
"So...this is what trump wants for America. He admired Putin and Kim Jong-un but disliked the political
leaders in Europe and Japan. The World needs to get together and save these poor, brain washed,
tortured and starving citizens in North Korea. Only the rich and privileged live in this city and enjoy the
wonderful things that the poor are forced to pay for with their lives. This is what a dictatorship looks 
like and a plutocracy is the beginning of this nightmare."
"3:19 ""All by myself"" clearly him and 2-3 other foreigners in the reflection lol"
This is their way of life let them be .
It's looks like everyone in North Korea is actor and tourist are the audience and that Fat Guy is director because it seems like a movie...
M glad you are back to your country
"Horrible hell, poor poor people, satan"
3:07 Is that Mickey Mouse? How come? That is a Western/American cartoon! Weird!
"He is a real photographer. Not pretentious he knows the art, and then you get everyone else in the world with smartphones thinking they are photographers. Give a real camera to most people and they wont have a clue."
PHUCK NK
Foe some reason that pool made me very sad
Stop using the word communism. This is dictatorship !
"One year ago and humans still bow to false God's,they bow to an overweight egotistical maniac"
jail is better than n.korea.

"Terrible country .. So sad for the people who is born there, they have no choice.. They have no freedom at all.."
It's GOOD HUH YALL ITS GOOD TO HAVE A GOVERNMENT LIKE THAT HUH ITS GOOD TO HAVE A PRESIDENT TO KEEP YOU LOCKED IN LIKE A PRISON HUH YALL HUH
This seems like hell on Earth!
SAD
It has such a beautiful nature. Too bad it is what it is.
I can't imagine living under the control of such an authoritarian system  all while knowing how big the world is- and that everyone else is living much differently.
"He keeps using the word ""leader."" I don't think it means what he thinks it means."
Just because you didn't find anything doesn't mean it wasn't there.
"Let's talk about what is the BBC nowadays: The BBC is ranked 3rd (!!) on the TOP 10 Anti-semitic Global List.
The BBC is the third most Anti-semitic news media channel in the whole WORLD. Number three! It's the BBC - the Anti-semitic publicly owned media channel."
Very weird tone and message. It is 100% fantasy but a very cruel reality for the population. This is promoting normalization of the situation.
Sure looks better than Sheffield.
RIP to his driver that didnt know where he was going and got lost
"if i was born and living in north korea, i would find the tallest bridge to jump off"
"Since then, the driver has been recovered dead. Nobody excludes a case of suicide."
"When Russians soldiers entered Germany at the end of de II World War they saw the beautiful houses with gardens and thought they were from rich people, so the burn it. Then, they found all the houses were like this, with radios, silk curtains and made out of bricks and not wood, and they were utterly suprised. They wrote to their families in letters that the soviets had to censor: Why they attacked us if they lived like rich? They didn't even know how people lived outside a communist country.
Also there was a scientist from Russia who went to USA and managed to bring a catalogue of products you can buy on letter inside his clothes. When he arrived to his home, he showed it to his wife, also a sciencist, and she asked him: If you can buy a tractor like this easy, who will want to live in communism? They simply didn't know there was another way of living."
Then what was the point of going somewhere that's setup for trained monkies to see...
can any one tell me subtitle font name plz its just osom
A country divided and controlled by uk france usa 2 divide and control humanity wars ai and more wake up
Humanity is dead bro humanity is fucked in only books reality is bowing before the wrong things
"i must not be the only one to think NK ""leaders"" deserve those respect they get. I've never seen a country as worse as this country..the fact that this guy tried his best not to sound offensive as if he'll get killed if he spills true shits going on in the country is just painful..NK citizens needs help and im not sure when they'll receive some.."
Totalitarianism. This is the actual fascism in the world. Ugh.
a role model for the future Berlin.....
I CALL THE CONTRLE OF HUMANS :(
:(
This is the future of the US if we don't change as a people.  Sooner or later the Democratic party will take full control and decide not to give it back.  From there the lucky person in charge will become the next communist leader.  Give it another 5 years and our children will be bowing down to their statues.  Happens every time.  Sad.
It is not communist it's their own dressing style and ideology
"Don't pay your TV licence, I'm surprised BBC didn't make everyone black."
"The only way to save North Korea is to take out that fat Kim Jong Un and liberate the people. 
The world sees what is happening but does nothing to help the people. Such a shame."
"I just realized that if pictures are not allowed then why don't people from the outside countries take drones to reveal and expose how NK trying to hide all poor peoples lives - the way they are forced to live. And then I realized to see it through google map, and there is nothing we can see!"
Excellent footage and interesting comments by Carl ...
"May be they obsessed with their leader, there images than character... But i find more similarities between last century , colonial Britisher and These 21st century North Korea leader.. 
UK people are also very obsessed with there queen and royal family .. Who build her empire on all blood & sweats of Asian and African people. But western media portrays them more civilized and cultured people on earth.."
A bit of a pointless video - one can only hope he's working up to more acceptance and therefore footage in N Korea.
More American propaganda
Pictures are more of telling a story of place person person feelings it is like opening book without words and words are there
"be interesting if he'd been there while the 25 million were starving to death--wonder what face he'd put on that? ""well it's interesting to see how other people live--and die"""
"Wow, socialism looks awesome."
Thank you for this video
What an amazing opportunity to photograph N. Korean culture
People still dont realise that they are implementing this globally on the back of plandemic
Strange and unbelievable country
It seems like a human ant colony.  Very Orwellian.
"I don't even think he ""didn't find any cameras"". I think he was warned to say anything about them."
Cero freedom.
"I only bow to Jesus, not statues of men!"
What groups of tourists are the kids being trained to entertain? What tourists are going to North Korea?
I know it's a weird question... Perhaps dumb... But do people from North Korea know that the world is different from them?
"Some contradictions in the comments here. Folks saying the photographer looks like he's being 'forced' to speak a certain way or to only say certain things, while also commenting on how some of the photos look like they should have gotten someone in trouble. If the latter is true, these photos wouldn't even be part of the video. Everything had to be approved, remember? I imagine there were actually many more photos taken over this 60-day trip and these are just some of the (or maybe the only) ones that were allowed to be shown. In short, I don't think there's anything 'wrong' with these photos in the sense that someone's going to get 'disappeared' over any of them. People outside of NK have just been brainwashed to think a certain way, exactly like they claim the citizens of NK have been brainwashed to think a certain way. The brainwashing just went in opposite directions."
"4:34 no i dont. up until that point i wasnt aware of what i was looking at was someones work, and i continue to not look at that way."
Like a present day soviet city
I love this guy. He sees nothing as a boundary but as an opportunity.
"A useless place
Why hasnt any superpower just decimated them yet?"
Exactly the same as I experienced in 2005 as a solo tourist. Nothing changed for 16 years.
3:04 Look closely to the left Mickey mouse How bizarre
Wery nice picture at 3:26. Like a painting.
So what commentary does this photographer offer on North Korea? We just make up our minds? He says nothing?
"""When there's a lot of limitations, I like it because you have to have more creativity.""
Yeah... you have to have A LOT of creativity to even live simple life in there."
"Very, very sad! How to free the Northkorean people for uniting with Southern Korea for a prosperous country again?"
I think they were not harvesting. They're planting rice.
"I thank you BBC for the wonderful and very interesting work.  Have a great year,  everyone!"
"The single MOST locked down place on earth. North Korea? Nope... right here, Melbourne Australia. FML *weeps*"
LOL LOL BBC commenting on 'propaganda' done by other nations!   LOL LLOL
"God bless N. Korea, I don't condone totalitarianism but the west has its own brand and countries like N. Korea at the very least show us that are possible alternatives to zero social security, no access to healthcare and  a skyrocketing cost of living. After the Plutarchs plunge everyone into poverty for the twentieth time in a 100 years people may just live like North Koreans in the future, of course they may have little choice for lack of resources."
probably 60 days of being in an open fortress
Please be respectful you guys.
his nervous reticence spoke volumes.
"Kill the dictator and his followers and end this bullshit, let the people live in peace already."
"I think the guy is soooo nervous is because he afraid of get assisanated by kim jong un, remember his brother????"
Just let them be themselves
I bow to no one.
I like how westerners view their version of the world as the gold standard and everyone else must adopt this view too.
Traveling to North Korea is supporting the crisis they have against their people. I hope he realize they use in the harvest human compost because their dictatorship don't have founds to give them the right fertilizer to harvest.
Why would anyone want to go to  north Korea? You support their economy by giving them money.  A county that kills and tortures their own people.  You've got to be crazy.
"How sad and boring must be living @ north korea. Not being able to read a good book about anything. Comunism, finally, is like the movie ""planet of the apes"", living a forced, ficticious reality."
When scientists commit suicide in UK. Its ok. No big deal. But if they retain foreigners in North Korea in hotel. Its bad. You cannot crop photos of National heroes of other countries. They should also be allowed some freedom of expression.
BBC spies.
Just stop having kids. Or are they in love with the big brother too
please do not be so critical of north korea -- they must be doing something correct and better than the united states -- they aren't facing the disaster of illegal immigrants flooding in from mexico.  maybe we should learn from them
The farm picture is of rice planting not harvesting. Seems misinformation goes both ways when it comes to that blockaded hell hole
What a miserable place. I feel terrible for the people/robots.
Be more interesting without the stupid music
So basically everywhere you go there's a picture of dear leader that you have to worship Lol.
North Korea is indeed a weird country. But one positive thing is: you don't risk to be robbed and beaten up on the street as a tourist there...
Very even handed short documentary. Likeable photographer.
Video is disgusting! Talking and smiling like so many of the people are enjoying there lives there! You get a chance to speak with Otto? And the nightmare he spent there! Or many of the others that never made it back? Glad you were left with a smile.  Gave them the propaganda they wanted!
I don't understand why anyone would even want to visit NK.
I didn't expect to see Carl De Keyser. He is a Belgian photographer and super famous in Belgium.
"Why do people in North Korea keep having child, that's gonna make their life worse??"
"No homeless people, no drugged zombies on the streets, no pickpockets, no street gangs, no bad neighborhoods or ghettos where illegal immigrants live in bad conditions .... in any case it looks more normal, quieter and tidier than in 90% of European or American cities."
"How many times does he have to tell us ""I like it"", for us to get the message that he's a good little sheeple?"
No way in hell would I be placing flowers at their feet.
"We got to practice for exactly this type of living during covid mandates.
Australia is into the next phase....where they put you in camps, and you're not  allowed to leave, for the supposed good of your comrades.
Coming soon to a nation you live in.
Don't forget your papers....."
This video should have been five times longer!
2056 I'm liberating North Korea  the tomorrow war begins!!
If they checked the photos and approved them; how can they be shocking images?????
dude are you at a gunpoint or something
The photo of two statues in the mist is stunning. It really depict the monster that is dictatorship is watching their every moves.
"""I like playing with fiction, but it's reality""... That says it all. Big Brothers Commies the BBC presenting this trash too. Perfect. What a joke!!"
"There are several books about North Korea. Go read them!!! Really, inside stories that will baffle and astound you..."
It's all propaganda! What a hell hole for the North Korean residents!
"The nature itself would work for you before you crop, signifying the illusionary power of his regime"
"That driver def knew where he was going, he just acted like he was lost to make it look less sketchy on his end so he doesn't get in trouble."
People in the comment section are overreacting. Lol
Seems a hell of a lot better than Afghanistan. Elegantly dressed people enjoying a type of freedom. Sometimes a culture or race needs to be guided in certain ways that they accept as the norm. N K is one of those
"propaganda should not be associated with North Korea, China , Russia , Cuba or any other sovereign independent nation that is rightfully anti West , propaganda should ALWAYS be associated with the West they are pioneers of it , top of the list the United States"
These photos are haunting for some reason - it feels like watching old photos of people who no longer exist.
I don't like to laugh at misery of some people. The ghastly truth is untold.
A true communist utopia
clickbait video no real content
How LAME .......
He showed the rich people enjoying their lives in NK. Not the truth. Shame.
they gave Carl de Keyz
"At about 1min 15 sec when you said ""to be honest, I liked that,"" you lost me forever. You like that your room was bugged and that you had no freedom whatsoever.  The North Korean people live in extreme poverty while their leaders get fat.  That's not something I like to see anywhere and the DPRK is the worst example how a government treats its citizenry."
My dream is to move to Pyongyang. I think it would be really cool.
Communism sucks !
"If you have been to North Korea, even as a tourist, you appreciate these photos. I like the rice farm photo the most. I was not allowed to go to any farms. I also tried to take some photos from my minibus but my 'guides' didn't like it."
Sick country with Joker Kim everywhere.
"NK is under siege, America is threatening war, why wouldn't they keep a close eye on foreigners? Clearly, he just went there to sneer and look for bad stories, his manner and his words prove that. Classic BBC agent-grade reporting!"
"Some statues and a rice field.  Wow, shocking stuff."
Shocking reality there's actually only one city in all of North Korea why because that's all they can afford to maintain
A Nice Medley: https://youtu.be/iNA-3_GyxlA
"Wait, so he liked being followed when he left the hotel room and likes the limitations but he says he checked his room for cameras and mics and didin't find any!?!?!? Bull....."
"I bet their dictator dont even know how to throw a punch. He hides himself behind his nuclear weapons to show to the world that he is badass. Think about all the brainwashing to these people, they have to live and believe that Kim Jung Butt's On is their God! Controlling their lives as if he owns his people."
Most depressing holiday ever. And you have to pay.
"Communism, I had to scape from one."
You was at a zoo then .
"Nebuchadnezzar, comes to mind."
"BBC is doing another smear propaganda. BBC, not trusted even in the UK."
Much of what was described is becoming reborn in the Land of Wuhan virus.
"I'm really glad that sometimes the video zoomed in in such a way that we could only see the ""leaders"" legs for example. Very satisfying knowing they don't want that."
Maybe I misunderstood but I don't think you should blur the line between reality and propoghanda or fiction because the world needs to know the truth. The people of north Korea need to be liberated from that life asap.
why is the population of north korea rising if it is such a hell hole?

at least they're not on board with the plandemic.
Who cares !! It's just like the crap BBC does..lol.. All lies
"Interesting look at North Korea and this photographic.  Too bad that, like so many other YouTube videos, the music was too loud, way too loud.  It wasn't even needed for an interview like this.  Nix the music in most cases is the best way to go."
"06:00 Same thing in Bulgaria during the totalitarian regime which lasted until 1989.
People outside the capital city couldn't live there.
Even visiting it was a big deal ..."
"Notice how modern day liberals don't touch suppressing, totalitarianism countries like N. Korea, but they'll be all over free countries like the US and UK."
The only real photos of NK are the drawings and hand paints done by defectors. There is a woman who spended 42 years in a working camp. If you can resist all the drawings and explanations without crying or throwing up... You don' t need a test: you are a psychopath.
"the amount of money spent on 12  people to watch one foreigner could be used wisely, well im sure they are paid by not being killed"
Gotta one of the worst places to live in the world.
What a Effed up country to think their leaders are gods... Pffft
"Yall should watch ""My brothers and sisters in the north"" its all on youtube"
"I have a friend, who is American, who actually ran a marathon there..and he says don't believe half the stuff put out and definitely don't believe anything the BBC put out."
"He finds none of this amusing or fun, but he needs to act like he does"
The more they try to hide and conceal the worse and horific it really is what there trying to hid.
"North Korea is an example of everything bad in the world. Poverty, no freedom, no democracy, bad government, intolerance, the list goes on forever. This is what happens when crazy people reaches power."
Such  evil to their own people their day will come and the ugly  leaders will suffer
"China used to be the same, I wonder if it still is?"
Illinois is just like North Korea.
i love how when he says you can't crop out anything while taking pics and then when the picture of the past leaders comes up at 2:30 it crops the heads out for a sec then goes back to normal lmaooo i feel like that was definitely a lowkey mock
Places never seen before. So no north Koreans have even see it?
"3:02
You see. It is Mickey Mouse on the left. It brings us to question, are North Korean children allowed to watch western cartoons???"
"They can live a good life with their own freedom, actually everyone has their own freedom but on different way. So don't just use western standard to judge."
"it is not a visiting if they only show u what they want ,not what u need to see."
You got that lil boy be headed for looking at you
"Sad thing is that no one can assassinate Kim Jung un or can even attempt to, guns are only given to the those in the armed forces. Another sad thing is that it's possible that N. Korea is worse than Nazi-occupied France or Poland (during ww2) or maybe it's equivalent."
The painting above the pool seems menacing
"N. Korea is a strange place... hey, where are all the tent cities along the highways like we have everywhere in USA ?"
Lmao bbc and truth do not go together.
Dam it sounds like North Korea is one big play
"THe party tries REALLY HARD to show the highlights of their country. When those concentration camps are still running. Since 2017, it has spent a LOT of money to try to put up a front. When people are suffering from hunger, and tyranny. All videos, and reports about the country in term of vids are too photoshoped. This is SHAMEFUL. To show people of the high class when the third generations rule still conduct thousands to the gulags. Shameful. It is PROPAGANDA. And it is sad to only show that."
"all bullshit!   he only was allowed to take pictures from the special private tour he had, and all picture he took were selected by the regime. 
You leave a bit the real path and you it would be really ugly the things you can find. 
As in any socialist country, those who are with the state, live average ""good"" but without freedom and then you have the other 90% of the country who work as slave to sustain that 10%."

Yeah he didn't show us very much. Any more than any other documentary I've seen on this subject. Guarantee they went through his video and photographs before he left the country. They never allow anything they don't want the outside world to see
BBC stands for British bullsheet channel
I DONT CARE ABOUT POLITICS. We need to send them food now and focus om the rest later
"Unfortunately there is no gas & oil in North Korea. Otherwise US would attack them and fight for ""democracy"""
The stuff of nightmares. Have a nice day.
watching these videos is so heartbreaking knowing what is happening right now.
Ridiculous..were suppose to have free rights....how are these things allowed to happen in this day and age?
Most of the country is not allowed in this city!
You got to admit it all works.
So their Leader(s) is literally seen as a God.
It's sort of sad that this guy wound up being a (unintentional?) puppet for such an oppressive regime.
"2:15 - Welp, that guide is dead."
"It would drive me Bananas, if I had to watch a children's performance almost everyday."
"I feel like this guy says multiple times in the video, ""Hey there's this bad thing happening, but I like that."""
"actually there were two girls looking at you, mr creative photographer. I enjoy your honesty and observance. and of course you found no devices in your room. it is obvious you are part of the proprganda machine, you are doing a good job."
Does not represent the rest of the country at all
How much bbc paid him
Hard to see the pictures with the giant closed captioning for a guy I can understand anyway.
"""you have to bow"" ???
only to my Lord , Jesus !!!"
this Dislikes are north koreans!! Such a hell of a country.
Very interesting how this applies to American politics right now with the big push to communist government
Feel like the real-life Panem where Pyongyang represents the Capitol and surrounding territories are to provide supplies to it.
"dont go over there idi,s .you play with your life.. fools..sty home and do somting for your country.. gods zoo"
"Though the pictures were wonderful, the restrictions makes it unappealing to visit North Korea.  Why go to North Korea when you have a chance to just go to South Korea and vacation as you imagine it to be.  I guess you can tell your friends and family that you've been to North Korea and they haven't.  I've visited Cuba in 2018 and I didn't have the feeling of being watched, even if I was."
If you came out of North Korea with any positive sentiment at all... they played you
those people are living in fear who would wanna do all that for a statue i would of said hell no i'm not doin that
"this country is run by narcissists. they put on a fake image to come off charming and wonderful, but really they're monsters who are incredibly selfish and manipilate/control others for their benefit."
"well I guess that I could never visit, because I would never bow down to any human...especially such despicable ones that treat their nation like dirt"
"You sir, have *NO RIGHT* to say ""and so on"" so many times. 
The repetition of that phrase belongs to Slavoj Zizek!"
BBC can get more horror stories within Britain itself.
why is there no video?
At the end of the day who would want to there no thank you
I want to visit
"How gullible this man is! Does he really think those kids in the fields working instead of going to school normally dress like that? The driver has never been that way before? That is so ridiculous. He cannot go out his door without his guards opening their doors (spooky!) and yet he thinks these trips were not planned? Everything he saw was choreographed down to that scene with the children in the field planting rice, the questions, the woman there to answer,  the North Koreans taking a picture of their child as if they are tourists, even if that is their child (maybe not), everything."
"Please free Assange. BBC is a British propaganda news channel like all western media, Australia Japan, and recently wion and gravitas of in India."
They have no access to internet...There will NEVER be a comment from NK here....That's bizarre
Would you bow before the statue of Stalin or Hitler huh? You are not going to realnorth korea....you go to Kimmys disneyland basically...do you know that f you visit this s*ithole then North Koreans see that how much youlove and respect their dictators...people think before you go to Kim dynastys disneyland...or maybe you just want to come back as poor Otto
"Maybe one day they will have the courage to remove that monster, just as my country did. I know is hard to live like this.I have lived only 6 years in communism but the scars are present"
"No one ever looks happy there, not even there supreme leader...."
What do they want to hide so bad?
"I read about smuggled music like K-Pop and movies like Pretty Woman, Titanic or Avatar from China. But I do think the majority of N Koreans don't know Elvis or the Beatles or Back to the Future. Never heard about it. Imagine that."
Kinda suprise that those farming picture got approved by N. Korea official
Mickey or Minnie Mouse at 3:00
no damm commercials on every inch you look at. Must be nice in a way
"3:35 It does not look like a harvest, but more like planting. 
Indicators: Season with mist that he mentioned earlier (probably spring), nobody wears hats against to sun some even jackets (not late summer) and most obvious: Those little rice plants.
Brilliant journalism!"
"North Korean hotel's bathrooms are surely equipped with hidden cams.. coz Kim expects something better than his pleasure squad, from the tourists!!

Nonsense!! Bow in front of what??? I would rather visit south korea
2 months Inside the hotel wtf
"It seems to me like many people here are misunderstanding his work and maybe not hearing his words. He's not a journalist or an activist, but a photographer and an artist. I think he explained himself pretty well, that his photographs are neither a perfect representation of reality nor a total fantasy, but ""playing with fiction"". Those are actually very beautiful and mesmerising images."
Creepy
Why can't someone kill that mdrfkr dictator nd see people of North Korea free
Tent Citys of America...!!! Alexa listening to everyone....we no different...ROFL

"This was so interesting to watch. The narrative was well woven together and it's almost like a story or fairy tale unfolding with the pictures. IMHO..the gentleman did an excellent job recounting his journey with both humor and reflection to portray what he saw. Pity it was so short, would've liked to see more. Anything on the secretive North Korea (& the people's lifestyles) tends to make for some gripping drama indeed."

The buildings all look the same.

What did you want from them leave them alone
They don't teach kids in schools in north Korea they just brainwashing them
3:20 all for him? Why are the mulitple people in the reflection? This makes this video not believable.
"Baked-in subtitles are extremely annoying. Also, they are not formatted for both lines to be of equal length. Also, why subtitles for someone who talks in English? YouTube has subtitles, please, use this feature. And while you are there, you can make subtitles in different languages."
this is a paradise compared to the USA which is full of drug addicts and homeless people
Nothing surprising in this pictures.The video title is clickbait...
"If anyone is threatening him then its most likely its BBC who are holding a gun to his head. I know BBC have gone woke, pro China ect. So i say this: this video is also pro north Korea propoganda because they are soft about it.  Dont watch it, there is nothing new"
"Why are people still so obsessed and fixated about North Korea? If they insist on treating foreigners so badly, just ignore them completely!! why do people keep pathetically feeding them attention."
Funny how this is starting to happen in the UK with the coronavirus bollocks and lockdowns

"They put on a big show for visitors to show how great their country is but it's all totally undermined by the fact that their citizens don't have the freedom to even leave their country because they know they would likely never want to return. If their country was so great their people would freely want to stay, instead, they are treated like prisoners in their own country."

So nice of him to have created such pure art, only little exaggeration here and there to make the audience wonder whether it is real, or propaganda....Really open-ended text it seems he created....well-suited to the times we are living in. If this is not great art, what is then? The background music wins though! Well done BBC!"
Amazing. It is the only country I want to visit.
North Korea is just like what an alien is to us. Human lives there but their rulers are aliens and they will keep their people as aliens from the rest of the world.

North Korea looks like 90s era
This country and it's people are completely screwed up to facilitate the luxurious lifestyle of the few.... it's scandalous it's happening and nothing seems to be done.....
But as someone who is one of the first with access to this mysterious nation as a photographer do you not feel a sense of obligation and duty to show the truth? To show the cruelty and dehumanization happening in NK?
If you like this country so much why don't you move there. Cause to like all this and think is right you have to like communism as well.
this guy risked his life taking those images in the mist
I question the value of Western media sending photojournalists into the PRNK repeatedly for years to always bring back the same carefully edited and sometimes staged official imagery of North Korea which the regime wants them (and us) to see.
This moron jokes around about how wonderful of a challenge it is to work around such strict rules. Glad you enjoy communism because the people of North Korea don't!
Clickbait.... wheres the bbc ?
Imagine putting flowers daily at the statues of people who robbed you of your freedom or your life itself.

@1:45.... One of the main reasons I'd never visit North Korea..... I ain't bowing before anyone.
I would love to visit North Korea
weird to see mickey mouse in the school wall ..
Most Scariest Horror Documentary of the world!!!
Felt awkward at ballet because all by himself yet in the photo you can see other people reflected on the glass.  What else is made up in this story
Hes literally trying to say how he liked being watched and not being allowed to go anywhere
why can't they sneak in a robot bird or snake for more pictures?
"Going to north korea is like putting your life and freedom on the line.once entering the prison,youre treated as a prisoner instead of tourist since they took your passport and phones.i would rather go to a trip where i can enjoy my fullest instead of being restricted and fearing for my life.the worst part is i have to buy flowers for the two fat dictator statues if i ever visit the depressing prison"
Real life city 17
People are suffering because of him in north korea....i think Kim jung is not human being..... most heartless person i've ever seen in entire world
Remember when they straight up murdered a kid visiting Pyongyang for... Stealing a sign?
I like the pastel colours on the concrete buildings.
That driver ded
what an amazing photographer
"Just do not get the RFID microchip, for it is the mark of the beast. And please repent (apologize to JESUS CHRIST) for idol worshipping..."
"That picture wasn't of a harvest, the people were planting rice.
I know, I have a rice farm in South East Asia."
"North Korea, syria, iran,...dictatorships that want to act like democratic countries & want unearned respect."
"I don't know who this guy is but he comes across as an idiot.  He talks about how he had his guides in the rooms next to his, he says he can't leave the hotel whenever he likes, there are soldiers outside and every time he opened his door, the guides were right there.  Then he says ""But I like that...its like being embedded or something"".  Well sir, no actually it's not.  It's called being restricted severely and being watched and having absolutely no right to privacy.  It's asinine to suggest that is positive or okay in any way, shape or form for anyone from a Democratic country.  I cannot understand how a person such as this guy can sit in front of a camera and tell a fairy tale like this and then have the BBC attach it's name to it???  I'm not a political person in the least but I think it's a mistake for anyone to characterize North Korea as anything but what it is, a mafia state with an appalling human right's record.  Of course there is no reason to blame the North Korean people, they are the ones who pay the price to sustain the regime but there is no reason whatsoever to paint a pretty picture of this place.  Don't insult the intelligence of the viewers!"
I wudnt waist my money to go to the land of NO RETURN
Photos look like painting
Communist are evil
This is just so sickening and shocking that a state like this is still possible today.
Michael malice's book dear reader gives a lot of insight into NK
"Let them live however they want to live, who are we to judge when our nation is a mess the values our founding fathers had set for us were taken as a joke"
North  Korea is  useless
M
So they worship him as a God
"looks like the US in way. dreamland set ups, propaganda, pledge alegance and so on."
Who wants to see what they don't want to the world to see?
"When the West screams ''my personal freedoms are being infringed upon!"" Show them this...Im surprised the suicide rate there isnt through the roof being controlled like this, everyday, from the day youre born until the day you die."

"this dude is delusional, i feel for the people in nk :("
CLICK BAIT NO SURPRISE HERE !!!
soon to be pelosi's Amerika
I hate North Korea.
How about watching a documentary about the u.k. made by a north korean broadcasting network?
"Thank you for a lovely video without any western propaganda spam about North Korea, the pictures is lovely and your view abot this is nice."
Foreigner= White or NATO guys. Not all
"BBC as usual active in propoganda,
Tbh North Korea is very beautiful country I have visited it , it's very nice country, many places to visit, you have freedom to do many things, that BBC shows you can't do there, people are very hospital,"
"Oh yea, this place is just wonderful.  Idiot."
And here I am with a pistol on my hip and cellphone in hand. Never been more proud to be a Yankee.
Look up cross examined
"I've noticed how the BBC won't ever play anything critical of the ""dear leader"" and his concentration camps."
See? Communism is wonderful!
He did not say anything useless video
Visiting North Korea is really on my bucketlist  !!
In all the videos I watch none speak of the screwed up weather
who do they think they are fooling?
thanks Carl! I loved seeing these photos!
Sorry but I'll never be go there
1
I would be generally interested to visit the country but I would be scared that they wouldn't let me go if I slip up and I do something they see as threatening like that one student that went there and came back on a stretcher in a coma.
"The picture in the mist, it is a master piece"
"These countries should just be called ""cult countries"""
"like all dictators of the world, Mr. Kimmie enjoys the life of a capitalist. but yet has his people living in the dark ages. If his country is so great, why does his country need soldiers to kill north Koreans who attempt to escape into south Korea?"
why come pretty useless. he definitely lying at the end
Can we talk about how beautiful is the dress the woman is wearing at 5.09
At 3:17 you can see other people in the reflection on the right. He was not alone.
"Pretty ridiculous. But if the leader died, everything he did will eventually disappear but not in another 20 years or so....I feel sorry for the citizens of North Korean"
On any given day i will prefer north Korea over india
Most of these pictures are faked too look better
The photographer says that he liked this or that often and how beautiful and wonderful things are there. Really weird that he shows no signs of cricital thinking.
"Beautiful pictures, very interesting work"
"It's one thing to show respect to a leader, it's a whole different ballpark when a man forces everyone to worship him. That's just a cult."
I want to go there....  One day I will apply for the Visa.
"Sad Fact: Nkoreans love and respect their leaders, little they didn't know that their leaders are the ones who's caging them in a sad life."
"Nkoreans treat their leaders as a god and they have a high respect for them, like they wouldn't have existed if it weren't for their so called 'Leaders' . Little did they didn't know that they can live good life without them."
Paradise
Sounds likemcanadas covid hotels..
Yea stay away
I am so blessed and thanks to God I got born to india
The bus driver that doesn't know how to do his job just reminds me of The Truman Show
The reason he couldn't find any evidence of him being spied on.. the walls are probably two-way mirrors
This isn't a game how twisted are you !
"He like the limitations, to be creative, can't you be more creative when free, a coward brain is speaking."
Puts it a bit too positive for my taste but interesting
We are lucky that we are not born in North korea
"Does anyone know that background music at 04:30 ? It's mesmerizing, would love to know"
"""""""Democratic"""""" People's Republic of North Korea. 
WTF!?"
"1:23 the first thing I thought of when he said that was crash landing on you, am I the only one lol"
I hope I'll see a North Korea that is free from this tyranny in the future
i dont understand why north korea has such idiotic way of living but alright
I learned nothing about NK.
I think that the driver is dead by now. :(
"Never ever would I go there, ever, zero interest!! Never Ever, no amount of money zilch"
they weren't surprising at all.
"Man, North Korea is such a beautiful country, too bad it's ruled by an ass, this could've been honestly such great country!"
"That is one brain-washed country. I wish they'd become friendlier, more accepting and open to the rest of the world instead of seeing everyone as their enemy. :/"
Didn't u asked them to shoot their prisons nd punishment system?
"this is athiesm max pro., at its zenith - worship of man"
It is where the dream of an infant is subject to interrogation.
"I knew his first language was German the second he said ""make good pictures""... I spent 3 weeks in Germany and the way they kept talking about ""making pictures"" drove me crazy lmao"
Hahaha! hilarious.
Interesting
The photos weren't extraordinary. The one with the mist had potential but the angles were all wrong and the people in the foreground made it bland.
Repent and be baptize follow the ten commandments Jesus is coming soon
They will show you only the best not the real North Korea
I don't like him saying north korea is communist. It's almost a dictatorship...
I worked for a company that did tours to NK and our customers were asked if they wanted to visit the Kim monuments and the rules were explained at that point. Most dd it to prevent and trouble for the tour guides.
"""I like it"". 
He is being threatened. I know it."
So what do they tell those little kids about the micky mouse picture I saw? That the great leader drew him and made him up??
"North korea is a much better place to live than places that force women to wear dark clothing, stay indoors, accompanied by men always. Only North korea all men go through same restrictions. Women face these everywhere, so not suppressive enough"
Long live his Royal Highness Kim Jong Un
Real Harvest? You mean planting.
THE POOL!!!
What is The UN doing
So glade that my grandfather and many other servicemen  stop this cruel regime from advancing.  I would only go to leave a terd at the monuments.
plot twist: the driver was actually following the original tour
Hey look north korea is not boming countries around planet
I honestly hoped everyone in this video or partake made it out alive....Like its very hard to even film in NK none less make it out alive trying to talk about the countries system.
Why tf youtube recommending this to me.I am scared as it is due current situation in Myanmar.
This is the perfect example on how to turn a beautiful place of the world in a living nightmare. As much the pictures are fantastic I felt myself depressed on watching this video.
It looks better than some parts of China actually.
"The problem with North Korea is that it does NOT want to be part of the US global dictatorship and it does NOT want to have a US military base on its territory,  unlike like South Korea which is only too happy to be part of the US global dictatorship and is more than happy to provide it, the US with military base on its territory.

For these reasons North Korea has been subjected these barbaric sanctions, for wanting to be an independent country! Independent from The US Global Hegemony."
We only see what they want
got a clear picture of North Korean system from Kdrama - Crash landing on you.
What bullshit you showed nothing in your photos apart from proper-gander
North Korea is even more developed than our African countries!!
Communism is really bad.
"North korea is so bizarre. Its not even communist, its looks like old korean kingdom with modern attire. Even their attire is so outdated and stuck in 1950."
"This clip shows NOTHING and nothing new! Watch Yeonmi Park's YouTube videos. She escaped from N.K., through China at 13 years old - VERY eye opening."
"You think if they know you open your door to go out the room must be bugged, just because you can't find a camera or microphone it doesn't mean they're not there."
This is sick
I'm never gonna go there because if I do I'll have to bow to someone who thinks he's a god. When I don't believe a control freak fatty to be god
Dude said he liked having guards spying on his every move and following him whenever he went outside his hotel room lmao come on man
Okay they didn't fake it in crash landing on you..
"I see videos of Jaka Parker, he fuckin live in NK from 2012 and has lots of videos from NK"
"Notice he says alot of, ""In North Korea, you have to...you have to...you have to...""   Thanks for the Communist Propaganda BBC."
adolf .... bin ..... kim .... whos next
"I feel he is protecting country rules and which is good but at the same time he should give some freedom to their people. 

But overall he is not spoiling the country by giving full freedom."
"Sorry, did I miss something? Which images were surprising?"
His attitude is really loving
So there are people that believe BBC lies ? They are not even good at it.
Lol they treat people like a toy
"Why would he alter the photos to make people wonder if what they're seeing is real?? The world needs to see the reality of life in NK, as limited as the photographer might be in what he's allowed to see."
It would collapse without China's support
If they had oil the USA would be all over them...
Real world Paradis Island.
Dude!? You were there for 60 days!! That's not a lifetime of hell. Your romanticizing hell!.
"North Koreans at 5:06 don't do it don't..... 
You are now getting executed for cropping our leaders' image. :X"
I won't bow for any man let alone a friggin statue
Cheers from North Korea
there's no war in ba sing se
"3:02 there's a blonde girl near him in the reflection of the window, why is he saying he was alone?"
"North Korea is just a dumb country because they say
USA is a bad guy and
South Korea a poor country what next
China is fat or something like that"
Can't we use vpn & send images to outside of North Korea
North Korea and it's two father son duo terrorist.
"Umm..none of these images are surprising. Sounds like he tried..but EVERYTHING you see on those NK tours is scripted, of the wealthiest most privileged, party loyalists."
north korea to him : who do u think your . fking president of usa ?
5:03 is definitely intentional and I love it haha
Why can't the dictator suffer the same fate as hitler and free North Korea?
Watch 'the mole' documentary if this was interesting
Did he find the camera ion the toilet bowl?
Delete video
"big respect for the venture, but the photographs are terrible."
The money foreigners pay goes to the government and pays to keep labour camps going and pays for bullets to kill their own people
F*ck Amerifats. DKPR is such a charming country that you will not be even closer to meet!
Why do some of these images look like they are took straight from my dreams
north korea is basically a country sized cult base
Shithole of the world
I wonder what do they think about climate change?
"DPRK farming still low tech no harvester by hand similar to our country.
they are leader veneration oriented like ancient kings. Even queen Elizabeth dont have that veneration.
Media /tv entertainment much cheaper.
understandable since ancient korea were Dynasties. 

Contradicts communism where farmers and working class should be the leaders. Communism by the book ofcourse real life Communism are varried.
with respect to DPRK not to humiliate but to point out."
I wanna move to the dprk
"Happy to have his private photo shoots...  and yet in his commentaire he glosses over the misery of the people.....  Says people can make up their own minds,  what a cop out..."
coming to the city near you in very short time
It's all fake an illusion... to give a false impression that everything is wonderful & fine....
I don't think foreigners should be  visiting N.K.
You have to go through a thick wall of lies before getting to the truth in North Korea
Interesting . . . . . . but terrifying.
"Great nation - the Americans, - because they are good and hard working people, but I hope that Donald Trump makes no more attempts at political ballet and stunts, otherwise this wonderful American culture might as well get to surpass the Korean leaders in their ""unique magnificence"", and this last thing, I fairly believe, is going to be a shame."
Love north Korea
This was great.
3:34 I'm sorry but that is definitely not HARVEST...
"Anyone curious to know more, there's a channel called Dimple that has lots of North Korean defectors that talk. Usually it's fairly lighthearted, but the guests have their own channels usually which are linked in the description where they may talk about more serious topics about North Korea."
Why do you need to bow in front of their statue? Are they God? That thing creep me out
Lovely people and culture. Shitty ideology.
"Why would you go to north Korea, not worth the risk of going to a Korean prison for trying to take chopsticks or some other little valueless thing home , wouldn't go there if you paid me."
No homeless ppl most be doing  something  right
"This guy is very comfortable with limitations and surveillance: a sense of getting attention :)
Next episode: being pooped on the head and saying it's nice to feel the warmth on his head  :-)"
The pictures look like if there were formerly black and white and then they were colorized.
Never to go to that hell hole
North Korea. What a place.
"Yeah this isn't North Korea, this is the tourist facade - the stuff the NK government want you to see. According to defected citizens the lights aren't even on when tourists aren't there. All the model citizens are made to put in a show for tourists (literally models), look happy, clean the streets all to make it seem like a prosperous nation."
The videos from people that actually escaped from North Korea are much more informative and talk about what really goes on.
Hes not saying anything negative about North Korea because this is a BBC channel. They are far left. They don't like criticism of communism.
"No God? No Problem. I'll be the Head of State and God. The worst, most dangerous, and hurtful aspect of any human. I am the Center of the Universe."
Very interesting video! Tip for collectors: Simply create an account on Pretty Good Bookmarks and bookmark it!
"There are missiles flanking the hammer and sickle floral tribute.  Charming. The hammer and the sickle originally symbols of the workers party and equality.  Well I suppose they have equality to a degree, everyone is a prisoner of a spoilt brat's whimsy."
"Anyone reading this comment, would you ever go to North Korea??"
The album can be seen here: https://www.carldekeyzer.com/dprk
"Every dollar you spent in the Propaganda amusement park of North Korea, bought a bullet for a starving human. If you have seen the movie the Hunger Games, think of it like giving President Snow money to see the capital and musing about why District 12 is starving."
"And boom, you killed the driver."
"North Korea's regime is the worst. Churchill who caused The great Bengal famine, burnt civilians to a cinder in Dresden, celebrated Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombings as his first orgasm is the greatest leader the world had!!! Franco, the mass-slaughterer given a clean chit for his horrendous crimes in the Civil war is FINE. Duke of Windsor who was a hardcore Nazi is also FINE. Franch which slaughtered 100000 Algerians after 2nd WW is also FINE. But North Korea is the worst regime, right?"
It's like the opposite of that movie 'Pleasantville.'
Did anyone else see the 50ft statue of Dennis Rodman..?.
"Where are the greenhouses that raise hundreds of thousands of beautiful flowers?  Who works there?   Likely one of the more prestigious positions in NK.  Thanks to all journalists, photographers, tourists who allow us a glimpse (and it is likely only a fraction) at how N. Koreans live."
Check out some interesting fact https://youtu.be/hSDH_zFrbYU
"i think noboby should go to to NK. If nobody goes there, the northkoreans would have to deal with the truth, otherwise they think you go there, you bow to the leader, you are interested to their country, because it is a powerful country of whom we have respect. And also you finance the regime. don't go there."
"Almost pointless video. Make a decision to be false or real and then stick with it, and let us know. please"
i strongly believe that this foreigner hotels equipped with in room cameras and microphones located somewhere
Fascinating and terrifying!
I really like your video of the statues in the mist.
Should have visited the prison camps
"sadly this all is propaganda. he just saw what north korean regime wanted him to see, and not what cruelty north koreans are really experiencing every day. ofc this only benefits the regime and I'm really sad a lot of people seems to fall for that. when he said he liked to be surveilled the whole time it broke my heart a little... this is not some game, this is reality for so many people in north korea that are suffering under this regime. how ignorant one must be to say such thoughtless things."
oh my..i thought the waves were real..Is it only silly me??
"Why so many thumbs down? Do people not agree that this is a fraction of what goes on in a communist country?? He took beautiful pictures, but there are much worst."
"If you want to learn the truth about North Korea, learn from people like Yeonmi Park who has escaped, not someone who's only been shown what the government wants you to see."
"3:25 - is not harvest, its planting of rice"
All the swimming pools in the Deep South in America got closed because of the racial mixing scandals
"Good job, dude. You indirectly supported the North Korean Regime's killing of its citizens. This is no different than paying the Third Reich to visit Nazi Germany."
The Bus Had An 'Accident' and the driver was killed after this video was published.
there is zero surprising in any of these images
Their science museum has the Eye of Horus or aka the Illuminati symbol.
"How did you feel to bow to a dictator? Wondering if you would bow to Hitler? You bowed and showed respect to someone animal who has enslaved 25 million people and has over 200,000 in hard labor prison camps for petty crimes....not to mention , you traveling there just funds his regime and nuclear weapons....you also sold out the taxi driver and that probably got him killed....do you sleep well at night????"
"I see NO reason whatsoever ever to go there.....I mean what for,... just see indoctrination and blind obedience?"
ghostemane
Did you really say you enjoyed NK?
How. . .how come this still goes on?
"North Korea must have written his glowing narrative as well. One would think this photographer was describing utopia instead of a hostile, oppressive, totalitarian regime."
I bet a single foreigner in North Korea feels like they're main star  in the Truman Show.
"No explanation about NK class system, nothing... 
shame!"
Patriarch RIP
ISTG if all the countries just stop caring so much about power and more about the people not only in their country but other places I think we could overthrow this dumbass place where there's absolutely no freedom and no respect for the people. Honestly.
Looks like no one is occupying the buildings lol
This guy is nervous as heck. He's not telling everything.
You seem like a foot leaker of the north korean leaders n culture ...
"Welcome! Welcome to city 17, you've been chosen or be chosed to relocate on one of our finest sub urbans center-"
Why are they so afraid of you or your kind ?
its hunger games
"He's saying he likes to be oppressed, followed and censored; yeah...i dont buy that. He either supports the dictatorship or he just doesnt wanna be blocked from future trips, either to make money or fame."
"Insanity.  All those giant buildings with nothing and nobody inside it.  That could've been a majorly successful city like Tokyo, Japan.. With millions of citizens.  Pyongyang is almost the same size as Tokyo.  It's truly a shame that a country with so much potential has to rot away along with the people that are forced to live inside it.  One person can cause this or worse... like Hitler, Lenin, Stalin, Trump, etc"
"The entire city is a dreamland, surrounded and infused by a nightmare."
Hi  mo
Anything our mass media (CIA)  says about another country is usually amiss.
That kid looking back must have been executed!
"Defund defund defund bbc ,i not here to watch bbc i am here defund defund defund defund defund"
Stupidest poorest nation ever
Is this guy seriously making excuses for North Korean Totalitarianism?
"I wouldn't go there if they make you bow to a mere man ""i bow to no man"""
Mm
this is so sad lol
Says the driver was always lost and took wrong turns r.i.p the driver
"Why did He had to say that He was fallowed or HAD to do something or HAD not to do it, or that He was under control or spy on....why this man could just stick to His work with out being preset that His experience will be BAD, or strange, haw about just different. And haw come it was strange  for Him that only foreigners stay at the hotel? only visitors ,travelers and tourists stay in hotels, local people have homes to stay in/live in, so it is not strange. And in the middle of the night He wants to go out side of the hotel for a walk?Man You dont need to go to N Korea, there other places on Earth that going out from Your hotel at night ,is ,well may I say it softly not a good idea. He did not say anything good about His stay in N Korea, just negative, very strange, its like His mind was set on the negative side, next time if You have a bad time, do not go, simple....but I know some tourist that bad time it is what they are looking for, so hey, its up to a individual person. TH"
Is like having a tour invited by the Nazis to enjoy Auschwitz....
"What's weird about that neigbor of ours is that their leader imposes very specific hairstyles to both men and women yet he himself doesn't follow it. Me beinh born as Filipino-South Korean I'm very thankful that life has been somewhat kind to me and didn't make me a North Korean who has to follow crap from their ""eternal leader"" and treat him as if he's above us all."
He says how much he likes everything ..LOL  .. Hypocrite  fool
Miserable part was that the kids have to dance even for a single tourist. pity them
"That driver wasn't lost. He was taking wrong turns because something was happening on the typical route that they didn't want foreigners to see. An unplanned arrest, an issue with the power, or damage due to weather. Anything that might show an imperfect image or expose unapproved families to foreigners. Those doors opening and his guides accompaning him in the hotel weren't accidents either. Yeongmi Park did a video on tourism in NK and she discussed the realities behind the perfromative nature of these tours."
https://youtu.be/zh-yiYcnyss
"This guy is doing a disservice to the Korean People. He is giving money to the regime, he bows to the statues and the North Korean media shows their people that even foreigners love the dictator.  I have no empathy for westerners detained in N Korea.
https://youtu.be/zh-yiYcnyss"
Plottwist: The driver took wrong turns on purpose crying for help
lol imagine seeing a black person for the first time and wondering why that guy hasn't taken a bath in five weeks
John 3:16
If jack black was old and European
3:07 mickey in north korea
I just know if I lived in North Korea I probably commit suicide
i don't find him nervous
Most pictures or videos in Pyongyang seem to be like Disney movies. Because they are too clean and complete.
"2:48 Iluminati nmpk x, lancau"
It's look like a luxurious jail whole country for thire people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Olm8aW8Ne0I&t=2s
Communism: ideas so good that they have to be mandatory
"After hearing about NK's archaic technology from visitors and refugees/defectors, methinks it's safe to never worry about hidden cameras and microphones in hotel rooms. I'm imagining one of those CCTV cameras from the 1980s hanging in the corner (noisily) panning left and right with a giant boom mic nearby, being the complete opposite of low profile."
"And what will happen if you don't bow down to the statues??  Because if it was me i would never bow down to anyone or anything except Jesus Christ and God the Creator of heaven and earth. 
And the people in North Korea do they understand English language? And what will happen if you talk to them about the Messiah Jesus Christ.?"
What about towns and villages
Like modern day slavery
Why would I ever want to go there
"""You can check out at anytime, but you can never leave"" welcome to hotel california"
"After knowing that I can take pics of the leaders, I might just go there and take a pic and send to my friends and be like hey remember our lessons 10 years ago kind of feel"
Basically foreigners are expected to act like they are a living member of their society since birth. Wow.
This is what the progressive leftists want the USA to be like.
"War ,Yemen,N Korea sometimes haunts my heart before I fall asleep at night. In my world disney people on the brain,designer logo wearers on the brain ,and celebrities groupies and idolizers ."
He is afraid to say it was nice.
"Just checked... it is of course, China. They are a major exporter of flowers. Who knew?"
"I just started wondering...where do all the flowers come from? Grown in NK greenhouses, or maybe China?"
Sounds like the worse place  to live feel so sorry for the people who have to watch every move they make
"The propaganda was wearing thin so they allowed Americans in so the ppl could see for themselves lol. No looting or burning in N. Korea, we dont have freedom of speach either, so which is better??"
North Korea is NOT COMMUNIST. You are wrong. Did you find any statue of Marx Engels Lenin Stalin....?
