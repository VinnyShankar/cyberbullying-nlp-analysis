Lovely work!

"Also, fun fact about the cherokee they mated with anyone and everyone so as to keep their bloodline going for as far wide as possible. So, most people believe it or not chances are youve got indian cherokee in you."
Greatest two people that ever existed in my lifetime imo.
You don't have to be crazy to do this but it helps....lol!
Jesus loves yall boys God bless u can still turn to Him
I like being good for you and not caring if I throw out bad
"Oh, I loves your paintings. And me? I painted myself some mountains and forests."
Beautiful
i love you so much bob Ross San
Awesome job!!
"Other than the ""I pulled a sneaky on ya"" he has the exact same mannerisms as his dad!"
NO HATE. LOVE
Thank you very enjoyable watching you.
"It may sound kindof tacky, but this really helps me with my panic attacks, the mellow tones of bob/Steve's voice, the way the paint seems to tie togeather second by second it's just so calming. Thanks guys."
"2:11 -- ""I pulled a sneaky on ya.""

I don't know why, put that was the most peacefully savage thing I've seen. Bro definitely has 100 Sneak in Skyrim."
"""See, I pulled a sneaky on ya."""
He looks like the lead singer of Ram Jam
He speaks just like his dad. This is so sweet.
Hamburger
The fact that th mountain looked nothing like a mountain then out of nowhere it looks exactly like a mountain
""" it's like dad said. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it helps """
In 20 minutes
Beautiful.
15 strokes and makes a masterpiece
Pretty wholesome video. Love it!
So beautiful. Great art.
its like magic
Tree With Eyes Balak long
"I had to double take at this thumbnail, I thought it was a young James Hetfield"
"""Tap it into the bristles"" AKA Beat it into the bristles! LOL"
"I've never watched one of these and barely heard of the guys. I'm shocked and so glad i watched the whole thing, man this guy's soothing to watch. This was amazing"
i fucking hate this guy
Astounding.
he pulled a little sneaky on us
nice hair bro
6:17
What gifts to humanity. Rest in Peace Bob.
Painting is patience and faith. You have to believe something good will come out of it all in the end and work and wait on it
2:11 lol he said the thing
What year is this? That is a sweet hard rockin mullet. Seriously! He could be in a thrash metal band in 1987 for sure
Hi
"If you have a motorcycle and you trust your handling  skills and traffic is safe, conditions are above average I really recommend Pacific coast highway, also known as PCH for a nice afternoon ride and dining experience"
21:57 stomach gurgle.
He makes it look as easy as breathing
"2:19

""Wow, look at that. It gets real soft.""

That's what she said."
thalo blue is fucking gangster af
Jesus.. he did that in 30 min??? Insanely talented
imagine the hogleg before this session
Bro already painted a master the first 2 minutes lol
I pulled a sneaky on ya. Story of my life!
Fros and mullets
He sounds so much like his father
Mr Bob Ross was a special man giving us not only his talent and skill of painting but also his means of calming the tensions and stress many people go thru each and every day. All you have to do is sit back and watch Bob Ross and you will see how by his painting and his words will make you feel so relaxed and calm that you will forget the stress and tensions of the day you might have went thru. He was this kind of genius and will never be replaced.
Quality mullet
Big Bob Ross inspired many.
This is better than any asmr
"Bob Ross was James Hetfields first cousin once removed. 
You can almost see their resemblance."
I pulled a sneaky on ya
Play Master of Puppets!
Sometimes you have to push hard in life.  Like a mountain climber climbing that peak like his life depended on it..
"Only 2:05 in, I started to see the ocean"
james rossfield ?
dont be afraid to get THICC....
holy shit season 29 episode 6? you mean to tell me I have like a year's worth of content to sit and listen to??
this guy is Bob's original happy little accident
Your dad would be proud!! Awesome painting
"You can see Bob's style in Steve's painting, obviously he learned a lot from his father. Steve's style seems a lot more dynamic, I like it."
Long live sex machine 2023
The fan brush on the canvas when he was painting the couples sounded so good
This isn't even close to his best work he's not even trying that hard because look how fast he's doing it
"""You don't have to be crazy to do this...but it helps."" That's a hell of a quote!"
Steves Ross?? With an equally iconic signature hairstyle?! Amazing.
"""Before joining Metallica..."""
0:26 hes so fine istg
Martha Stewart considered/consideres herself the female Bob Ross. Had it not been for Bob she wouldn't have been able to construct her wheat sale for K-Mart.
Dude he talks and is so calming just like his dad how amazing
"Bob. The man, the legend."
It's paintings you'd see in 10 start hotels
"How old is this episode? Judging by the hairstyles, is it the 80s or the 60s?"
Thats not Bob Ross that's Dob Boss
"He sure ""pulled a sneaky"" on me with that extra brush"
I feel like bob Ross popularized ASMR.
this guy blows
Un Real....what a talent the young man has
"Thank you for this channel. I have all the DVD's 
Water always finds its level. And the horizon is always at eye level no matter how high you go. Did you know These are clues to our reality earths not a globe?! Furthermore, how does Gravity work on flat earth?"" It doesn't, because it isn't required. The natural physics of density and buoyancy already perfectly explained why apples fall down... https://youtu.be/OOeP7TrSeaQ by Eric Dubay."
I first thought that Bob discarded the afro when I saw the thumbnail lol
young people make me sick.
I can see an ocean in the 1st part
Good Drawing I like your drawing so much@@@@
This is one of the greats
I just wonder how well Bob raises him
2023 and to help me sleeping ross is there
i am at school
"Its a nice painting,,,,maybe just one thing is that foam even under the rocks through whole area  is really unrealistic and that is disrupting my overall view on that painting"
1:07 dude just used 1 color and you can see this gonna be an awesome paint
In this video Bob is different
This isn't painting. It's therapy.
His hands look exactly like his dads when he paints which is funny cause when I play guitar and my dad plays guitar his friends always say that mine and his hands look eerily the exact same
Two absolute kings
You sure thats not James Hetfield?
James Hetfield????
It's Michelangelo by the way.
"*paints a mountain that makes me question reality*

Also,

""OK, let's get serious"""
Rip bob ross
beautiful painting... wow...
"Direct carbon copy of Bob, love this"
that's just...wow...
God bless your father. Children can never take the place of their parents.
:)
His hair
This mf painted a beautiful sky and  ocean like it was nothing
Absolutely no one will believe this but my dad smoked weed with that guy
anyone else still watch these in 2023?
Lmaooo
2:08 MY FAVORITE PART LMAO
Tell you qqqwhat
"In the beginning, the water he painted looks like it's the ocean... At the end, it's a Lake... So cool lol"
3:20 titanium hwie
The Waffle House has found its new host
BillyBob Ross
I just love art and watching this is soothing to the soul.  Now I want to paint too.
If I were bob I would be proud. Most definitely
4:10 made me laugh
https://youtu.be/fm92EoaNsgQ
James Hetfield is an incredible artist.
"This man loves crimson
Hes the crimson kingg"
It looks like heaven
Yessssss Peace to the spirit
Bob loved that old dirt road!
6:20 this make my day :D
spec-F'in-tacular Mullet!
Just found out bob Ross was half native America 12:39
Nice hair
"Just turned it on while sitting on toilet...
Why is it so good and relaxing!?"
actual footage of someone saying California is nice
that trash
Who is that? that not bob ross it's different guy painting by himself.
"This video just screams ""80s"""
after watching this I know im not an accident... im a happy accident
The OG Asmrers
Is he using acrylic paint?
"He becomes more serious as he grow up, loosing a bit of his joy. I'm glad he remained strong after loosing his dad. This painting is beautiful! I would like to try it."
2:08 bro could end the painting there
I'm wonderful
2:12 A legend was born
No the world started by the lord bob ross was a holy man
"watched this in my ap lang class, so glad I came across this !"
"This is my favorite episode
And"
He does mountains really good
<3
"I have never watched a Bob Ross video, I thought I would get bored after 5 minutes, then watched I the full video without realizing"
This guy looks like he just stepped out off a 1980s porno studio
And a happy little accident
"This was so relaxing. As an Artist myself, they have truly mastered this technique!"
All of the jagged peaks that we call mountains are actually massive ancient petrified tree stumps .
Mullets in the 2020s have nothing on the masterpiece this guy was presenting to the world on a daily basis back in the 90s
I love these men.
Now that's a mullet!!
"got to watch out! people always try to ""pull a sneaky on you' eh?.... eh?.... lol"
"Well, dang. Now that I know about the vultures running this channel in defiance of the genius himself, I'm torn about watching it."
I sold mine when I was 10
"why did not he eat anyone?
i need bob ato eat someoene in the netc epsidos"
He sounds like his father and he looks alot like him. Very interesting and relaxing in the same way.
He pulled a sneaky on us
The thing about painting is that nothing else matters... Never cared for what they do... Never cared for what they know...
2:11 HE SAID IT
Fucking hippies
I had a friend who watches this a little kid.  He could seriously draw portraits from memory.
The hair is strong amongst these 2
This is a beaut
Bob Ross lives on the tube
Pure ASMR! Visual and audio stimulation.
"A wise young man once said ""if you're doing a cloud, think like a cloud"""
Puts into perspective the level of mastery Big Daddy Ross has.
OMG! Did Bob Ross invent let's plays?
Cute
This man captures the 70s and 80s all in one hairstyle
Looks like James hetfield during his cowardly lion phase
Bob Ross video turns in to therapy
He's like a younger version of his father.
This man blinks every word 0:00
These videos bring me back
"*""People are too hard on themselves these days""*
Man, some things never change."
More talent than his Dad .
where da waterfall
The vibe..i love it
Its the final countdown ...  TURURURUUU.. TURURUTTTUTTTUUU.. TURURURU... the final countdown..

Jesus Christ is Lord and KIng and Our Savior!
Bob Ross a teacher everyone wants to have.
What a joyful painting!!!!
Man watching this while high is quite the view
"OmG!  He is the spitting image of his dad!  And he sounds like him too!  I just wish there was better photography in his time...  I remember my 70's and 80's photos, by today's standard, they're like cave paintings!"
But why the massive tree over all of the rest
Jesus Christ is Lord and King and Our Savior!
"man really said ""hwhite"""
2:10 IT`S THE MEME
"13:59, 19:32 & 20:57 hahaha i love this guy!"
2:10
My opinion not the same
"2:08 LMAO I DIDNT KNOW THIS IS WHERE THE MEME CAME FROM, always a treat to find a meme origin"
Thank u kind men truly wholesome. Makes me thank God . Yay skateboarding
I'm wondering who's getting paid off this channel?
I want his hair

Such beautiful human beings.   enjoy your journey into the eternal sweet bob show us all many pretty trees in heaven

BULL SHIT

Wonderful video
I like it
E
Many. USA quickly needs to welcome in women and children
"He sounds exactly like his dad 
I use these for asmr for sleeping and i couldn't tell a difference"
2:10 a meme was born
WAU   WUNDERSCHOEN
He looks like a pirate. LOL.
Beautiful! I love waterfalls. You can definitely tell that you got your dad's talent and style.
A worthy successor to the Ross throne
"No joke, looking at the thumbnail I thought it was just a guy either trying to be him or doing a parody.  They are both great painters."
OMFG its like a Bob of 20 years old and pacifist hippie 70's fashion style
he is beautiful .
I respect the mullet
He has a great sense of humour too.
I wanted bob and i got this >:(
Wholesome 100%
Its all the same kinda shitty paintings.. some mountains or a forest..
23:19 im dying i love this man.
How is anybody supposed to keep up with this watching it from the tv? Lol I wonder how many actually kept up successful successfully while it was still on air
Did his stomach growl at 21:55?
2022.05.23.                                   1:04
I wish I had a mullet hair
Bob Ross could have painted the same picture a thousand times and it would always be interesting
Man those clouds are so clean.
Video is so old that people were still nice in California!
;3
Amazing talent. He obviously loves painting because pops is rich.  Amazing..
"I'm autistic, I also like painting as emotions are hard to express when you yourself don't understand them
I love Bob ross, and have a Bob Ross collectable collection that is still expanding 
Now here is a fun fact about him
Bob Ross had an accident when he was in his teens resulting in him losing the top half of his left index finger and he always help his paint pallette in a way to hide it.....the more you know about an amazing man"
"Have you made any of these with animals? Like birds, marine animals or land animals? That'd be cool!"
Those clouds are MEGA realistic!
Bob seems like such a proud father
Now I feel like I'm on a different planet. A Whole New World.
ok
I love you paintings
lol best asmr
"Damn, the apple really doesn't fall far from tree."
ASMR is that you?
Likes california.... I wonder how he feels about it today
Its so calm i love painting its the best
Mountains mountains mountain mountains mountains do they do anything else that mountains
"Huh.. tell me they don't have the hair of angels now, that mullet is one step from being deemed a saint itself"
Bob has a strong DNA
"2:11 ""I pulled a sneaky on you"""
Can't believe this guy was 52 at time of death but looked 75
Is it oil?
Whoah dude! Made a painting in 10 strokes! Lol
I like what he said in 4:30
"Somewhere theres a family with great haircuts, who can't paint at all."
James hetfield
Who is watching this at 2022
"Set aside one hour a day to make art, any type. After a month it will be habit and you will drastically increase your skill.  Family and friends will buy something from you and now you're a professional.
This channel will motivate anyone.  Bob Ross is the Dave Ramsey of the art world.
My favorite art books:
- Art and Fear by David Bayles
- Small Paintings That Sell by Lola Ades
- Great Fighter Jets of the Galaxy 1 by Tim Gibson"
He literally sounds like Bob but louder
**  I did not know that James Hetfield (metallica) painted in his youth..?  **
nice video!
This man is nice wit it
Bruh its 2022
How does the paint dry so fast
Can't belive he made this?!
https://youtu.be/tgU4FS7hZ5E
james hetfield ?
GET  MORE 5G VERSION  BORS
I thought they replaced bob lol
Bob Ross looks like Jesus
"""I think blue is my favorite"".
He and his father literally ALWAYS wear blue shirts..."
"Oh young bob, the people in current California are complete dipshiits."
One thing the Ross have is hair
Looks like he's dying to get this done and get to the Scorpions concert.
2:07 I pulled a sneaky on ya meme
2:12 the meme
All I can say is Wow! The way things develop is incredible. Very easy to listen to also.
"Wooow sooo pretty painting Awsome presentation,,,, good Shearing,,,,, and wait for your next videos,,,, lot,s of LOVE from (Rongwala)"
"""People are really nice"" in California, yeah right"
Hhhh
RIP bob you taught many people to paint
Was this a military cloning experiment?
wow i cant believe he made this masterpiece in 25min
that aint bob ross wtf
It calms my mind and gives me inspiration and serenity when I watch these videos
"Paints the the same pictures as his dad, sky, water, mountain and pine trees. Never any real variation with this method."
I'm so high right now that I watched THE WHOLE THING
"Bello su arte. 12 2 2022
CHILE."
I love That Knife they used
is he using oil paint or acrylic paint??
Glad to know he is indian.
Bob
great video
Is he still painting? I hope so
"I honestly thought the meme was y'know memeing, it makes me so happy to know he actually said ""I pulled a sneaky on ya"""
2:11 oh my he pulled a sneaky on me
is nobody gonna talk about how Bob Ross tried to ride a skateboard and fell
I love how they say WHite
"Feel the wind in your hair
Me who doesn't have any"
I love this man
"like Samson's strength, their talent is in their hair"
"Lol, a sneaky."
This was delightful.
"You don't have to be crazy to do this, But it helps. Best line ever!"
"those mountains come out so incredibly, it looks like i can climb them!"
He did have the best teacher.
He just sounds like a younger bob ross
This is kinda trippy lol
"*""Liquid hwight""* SOLD!!"
You sound just like your dad. Love him to pieces.
You can tell he's inherited Bob's skill
We know the story behind Bob's afro..... but what's up with Steve's mullet??? Could not resist that lol. RIP Bob... You are missed!!
2:11 nothing else said
The Ross men have good hair genetics.
His wife was so lucky
Man he is so Good............
You can tell how much his dad was a mentor for him and such an influence by watching this.  Warms my heart.
"2 min in, better than anything I've done already!!"
Love u work
I would have loved having Bob as a Dad. What ever career path I chose. The love and happiness would have been wonderful.
"My girlfriend (an art school graduate) advised me, a gamer who can barely draw stick figures, to watch this. And. My. Mind. Is. Blown. Holy shiz, it can't possibly be this simple?!"
Cada figura estranha!  Kkkkkk
Your just like your father your painting is so good I can't even put it in words
It is shining through.
IM CRYI
I want a panting Bob ross
Watching this while smoking a blunt is amazing
The sudden ''good to bad'' plot twist.
MEME ORIGINS
WHY IS THIS ADORABLE
Bob must have been so proud!
Another great episode with Another great painting. I could watch this all day
"Easily one of the greatest mullet/mo combos I've ever seen. Also, awesome talent.
Edit.
This is absolutely outstanding. Bob must have been the proudest dad seeing his sons painting skills. Fantastic."
can we just talk about how majestic he looks with that mullet/mustache combo
helal aga
He's got the spirit...
Good hair comes in the family for them
I love it sir! very easy for you your a good painter.
Didn't know James Hetfield was into painting before making it big with Metallica.
Incredible that in 3 min this guy paints a beautiful ocean scene. #jawdropped
this painting is so beautiful
"The ""indian"" thing at 12:35 was kind of weird."
Happy little bass in that water..
this is so wholesome:(
Y'all remember the first time he painted on this show?
He is a copy of him even in the way of speech and style
I see Bob screwed the cameras man wife behind his back
where's the pinned comment by Bob
"so by watching this videos we sr giving revenue to those who scammed and stome BR's legacy??? k imma head out of this videos then, not worth much but wong give it views anymore :/"
2:10 for people who came for the meme.
just as wholesome as good old bob haha
Bob smiling with a lil bit of tears of joy
"Getting stoned and watching Bob Ross is probably the best thing ever, I don't get stoned but I can imagine stoners watching these videos with munchies having the best time lol,"
3:02 looks like you're in the sea and a wave it's forming your way
I remember watching Bob Ross at my grandparents house in the late 80's.
Learnig to live stream from the ross'
"He sounds like his dad when he says ""white"""
"""You've gotta have life and death in nature. It shows reality""
""God made everything to have a place in this world"""
Honestly thats a shitty painting
"You don't have to be crazy, but it helps. My motto"
8:15 I now wish there was a video of Bob Ross skateboarding
"Actual name: Steve
My brain: Rob Boss"
"I have seen money turn friends into enemies at a time of collosal loss like we all feel with Bob Ross's passing.  Watch a ""young"" Steve as Guest painter, Dana Jester, & others.  Bob loved them all!  In the end, that's what matters.  Michael McClary, Professor of Music, Georgia Perimeter College, Dunwoody Branch."
"i read steves made a comeback, and that he didnt realise people missed him that was a 2020 article"
I like that I cannot determine the year this is made.
i wanna know who tf disliked this???
Damn thumbnail made me thought he used hair straightener :D
"Steve is the evidence that even last minute of his days, Bob stayed true to his name.. Making people happy over money"
Anyone notice how Steve only took 25 minutes to draw this masterpiece
He has the looks of his father :)...no really i saw the thumbnail and thought this was a younger Ross
bob ross was the guy he was the best painter in the world I watch him
It took him less than 20 minutes to make that piece of art??
I can't hold this secret any longer.. Bob ross told me to paint a bush in the left bottom corner of my canvas... ouuff
Steve paints just like his father.
"Very nice penting sir ,sir ek request hai ki penting puri hone ke baad samane se puri penting dekhaya kro"
"I love this. Bob taught him well, beautiful!!"
Mto lindo
"Shit, in the thumbnail I thought that was Bob younger....????!!"
"Why aren't we seeing these types of videos in 2021? Nothing on education, hobbies, etc."
"Ya-know when your doin a cloud, think like a cloud. 3:54"
aaa cute
"Like father like son.

This dude could've carried his legacy"
the kawalski's were a heinous couple . RIP Bob
"I'm going to paint a little bush right here and if you tell ANYONE that bush is there, I will come to your house and cut you!!!"
Imagine being steve and seeing this and not getting a cent off your work.
He is just like his dad hahaha
Imposter ross
I'm really happy now that I know bob ross 2.0 is painting
How does James Hetfield play in Metallica and paint pictures too?
AT 2:09 STEVE ROSS PULLS A SNEAKY ON YA!
Now that's a mullet!
I hate seeing any clips about Bob Ross now because all I can think of is the sad Netflix doc and how badly Steve and the family got screwed by the Kowalskis. It's sad how awful people can take our enjoyment away from something so simple and pure.
"If you saw the netflix documentary, you owe it to bob ross and his family to unsubscribe from this channel and block all its videos. #UNSUBSCRIBEBOBROSSYOUTUBE"
Sign the company over to Steve.
"They use Steve, he should get money for it"
So cool! :)
"Pareidolia : at 2:20 !
 I see, ""Slimer' from ""Ghostbusters"", starting to apparate!  ;)"
"Like father, like son"
"Bob Ross is wonderfull person, not only for his beatifull pictures, also he was a a great human being"
"I love this so damn much bruh, key to happiness!!"
"When he said ""I pulled a sneaky on you"" that made me laugh haha"
This is my favorite episode with Steve. The Kowalskis did him dirty. The Melissa McCarthy produced Netflix documentary exposed the greed and deception of the Kowalski Family and leaving Steve Ross without what should have been his rightful inheritance. We support you Steve 100%
He's good. But he's not daddy good.
"These people were robbed, watch the Netflix documentary you will be disgusted."
"Boycott Bob Ross inc. 
Justice for Steve Ross"
"DONT BUY ANY BOB ROSS PRODUCTS. AFTER WATCHING THE NETFLIX DOCUMENTARY. ALL PROFITS GOES TO THE KOWALSKI FAMILY AND ZERO DOLLARS TO THE FAMILY OF ROSS. KOWALSKI ARE GREEDY SOB,"
Man that Neflix documentary has made the Bob Ross comment sections boil for the first time ever
Nice
For a second I thought that was bob in the thumbnail lmao
"JESUS CHRIST-   Dad had the worst hairdo in the world (fake perm)   and then he introduces his son that may have topped dad; with the ugliest mullet known to mankind.

A very hair challenged family, to say the least."
"Dang this dude is 6'5"""
The world is too evil for two good gentle souls like Bob and Steve.
11:00 hes indian??? Damn that's awesome but he doesnt look like it tho
7:00 best joke of the decade
"I'm unsubscribing from all these B.R.I bs, greedy rats"
This is sadder after watching Netflix Documentary. Never buy from B.R.I.!!!
Mad skills like his dad...talent!!
"Bob Ross and Steve: Good
Annette Kowalski: Evil"
I recommend everyone go watch the netflix documentary
Just saw the documentary and I understand how Steve feels. His father worked for years to leave a legacy and make sure his family would benefit from.
"Ah, those 70s hairstyles....gives white ppl a bad name"
Steve Ross looks like Benedict Cumberbatch
2021 anyone?
"I just finished watching the Netflix documentary Happy Accidents; Betrayal & Greed and I would highly recommend to everyone who loved Bob, to watch & see how his family& only child Steve, can't even use his birthright name bc of two low life greedy lying manipulating dirty pieces of trash human beings. Bob would roll over in his grave to see how they stole his name & everything associated with him. I will NEVER buy anything with Bob's name on it to just make them richer. These greedy people will pay one day. 
Matthew 19:24
I'll say it again-it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of A needle than for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of God!"""
"I just watched the documentary ""Bob Ross: Happy Accidents, Betrayal and Greed"" and was wondering: Who is profiting off this Youtube channel? We need to be careful who we give our views, clicks and likes to."
Steve made me cry when he talked about his dad
Kowalski Inc just don't sound  as good as Bob Ross Inc. Sad.
Looks like James Hetfield
Is it too soon to bring back that haircut?
"I don't know why everyone just accepts the Netflix documentary as the gospel truth. Steve had his day in court. He lost. Isn't it amazing how the incriminating phone recordings and all the other evidence magically disappeared? Everything Steve and Steve's friends said about what Bob said and what he supposedly wanted was hearsay, and there's no way to know if a word of what they said was true."
"Steve is the only one that can truly recreate the magic of his father Bob. 
Please like if you agree"
Give his son the rights to his dads name!! Heartbreaking this is nothing bob would of ever wanted.
"Bob Ross Inc is evil. They need to be destroyed (as a company, and the owners should never be able to be successful in any endeavor for the rest of their lives). Pure evil to steal this beautiful man's life's work and pervert it (poorly) for cash"
"STEVE MAN IM SO SORRY THESE PEOPLE DID YOU LIKE THIS. MAKE YOUR OWN CHANNEL! ILL BE THE FIRST ONE THERE, PATREON AND ALL."
You even own the rights to a youtube channel. You guys really didn't cut any corners on profitting from his pain did you? #BOYCOTTBOBROSSINC
That hair is legendary
The Kowalski Family is Fleecing Bob Ross's legacy. Do not buy Bob Ross products until the Kowalskis share the pie. dirty schmucks.
This video looks like the 80s
Watch the Netflix documentary Bob Ross Happy Accidents Betrayal & Greed. Steve Ross & friends of Bob story of how owners of Bob Ross Inc became millionaires from the talent & name of Bob Ross.
Fuck the Kowalskis
"""I won't tell you that to embarrass Dad"" lol Dad probably saw. Video or watching from heaven lol"
Look like an elf in sky in painting
BEST   PAINTING     EVER    !!!!!!!
Had always wondered what happened to Steve after his father passed. Very sad to see how they screwed him over. I wish him all the best.
Rob Boss
My prayers are with Steve...he deserves justice and BRI deserves hell for stealing his legacy from him
Looks like this channel is owned by Bob Ross Inc.  There's a link in the about section. You can go feed the beast and buy merchandise that Steve Ross will never see a penny of.  I wonder if Steve would have done this program if he knew the truth and how it would play out.  Filthy.
E' veramente ingiusto che Steve non percepisca una lira dei guadagni che vengono dal nome del padre.
Is it acrylic paint you are using
Justice for Steve
Give Steve his Dad's company.  Kowalski's you are an embarrassing shame!
I like his paintings better
Hi. I grew up near your dad's inspiration.... North Pole Alaska. It's the most beautiful place ever.  It will always be my home. My grandmother and dad great Artists. I like to paint ceramic... well bisque...I haven't done anything lately. I'm not that great... always wanted to be. I'm inspired by Bob. I can't do 2D.... I'm probably not great 3D. My grandmother died of Luekeme.... Are oil painters all going to get some kind of cancer?
Fuck the Kowalskis and fuck this channel. Every time it gets a view it puts money in their pocket and not in the pocket of Steve. Time to sail the seven seas once again.
I almost feel bad for laughing but Bob was a great guy
Netflix exposed the the kowalskis for being thieves that they are I refuse to spend another dollar buying anything from bri Bob's rolling in his grave
Time to save Steve!
Steve Ross should own his fathers legacy not the rat infested Kowalski's. #boycottBRI
<3 Steve
You tainted Bob's Legacy
You should pay steve what he deserves for helping his dad. This is a slap to the face to the blood of Bob. Legal or not.
"Sad to think Steve gets nothing from all the money Bob's likeness creates for BRI.  Greed wins, which isn't so happy."
What a beautiful gift to have. Im a dirty licensed plumber. And he can make a dream piece in 20 minutes beautiful gift.
"Bob Ross: Happy Accidents, Betrayal & Greed"
"After watching Netflix's Bob Ross documentary. I no longer can watch Steve as the pussy slayer, I just feel sad."
This company is garbage B.R.I. Kowalski family. Steve doesn't like you thief's yet you have a video of him generating dollars for your greedy hands. Joan Kowalski you should do the right thing and fix the bad that your parents did
I want to be the father to my son that bob was to his. Positivity really works.
"nice hair steve, but fuck you kowalski's"
"okay now lets get serious 
me: get wot?"
Boycott the Bob Ross  company if you want to support Bob Ross and his legacy
Sad what the kowalskis did to this mans legacy to this day using the Ross name for there own personal greed. The devil is patiently waiting for them
Your dad on PBS was amazing.  And I see he passed on his talent to you. It's a shame that Bob Ross Inc are a bunch of greedy pricks and are shutting the Bob Ross family out of profits.  Also why does mine never look as good as yours or your dads. Think like a cloud bro... it's 420 time?
Give Steve Ross what he rightfully deserves! It's time for the Kowalskis to pay their debt.
1:07 they forgot to run Kowalski Soul Black.
"F&%K THE KAWALSKIS!!!
STEVE WHERE CAN WE BUY SOMETHING FROM YOU?!
ALSO IF YOU STARTED A YOUTUBE CHANNEL DAILY OR WEEKLY PAINTING YOU WOULD HAVE LIKE A BAZILLION SUBSCRIBERS IN NO TIME."
"I loved Bob Ross, I do not like the fact that his name and images are controlled by greedy people and will no longer fund anything with his name until it is returned to his son who is his legacy.  Those who do not know what I am talking about if you want to be informed there is a Netflix documentary that will explain a lot more than we knew.  They have gone after other artists as well.  Bob Ross was never about the greed..."
Steve is a lot like is dad the best beings on earth that help me through depression
2:05 for the meme
I can't believe the Kowalski's even own this fucking YouTube channel. Fuck you.
He is better than his dad. He makes this look fast and effortless
I hope the Kowalskis have a terrible day today.
"Just saw the Netflix documentary, my heart is broken for Steve. I wish him all the best and I hope that something good comes out of the world learning the truth!!!!"
"""I pulled a sneaky on ya""
-Bill Cosby"
Just saw the Netflix documentary. Sad.
"my god, that mullet is magnificent..."
So sweet and great at painting just like his dad!
This man is the king of asmr
"...man, this gentleman is Good...
Right on."
"Painting is a discipline in of itself.
Flawlessly sharing the gift of painting is a gift far fewer of us
can do with such ease...."
"When painting a masterpiece you have to be that masterpiece!
Bob taught his Son well!!! Wow!!!"
Literally his twin literally every single thing is the same
Got to make the sound effects like that it won't work unless you make the sound effects
Two minutes in and the painting already looks amazing wow
Even his son has the same pronunciation of ''hwite'' and I think it's adorable
My gosh he has his dads voice and humor too
This dude literally painted a perfect painting In 60 seconds didn't even need to do anything else to it..looked like a beautiful sky and ocean
When i hear is voice its like medicine
POV you made your way here from Ifunny..
"4:09 ""hmm just like dad says, "" ' you don't have to be crazy to do this but it sure helps""'"
James Hetfield?)
need Steve to bring back TJoP
Only if the Ross family taught me to paint in person
I wish I could take one of his classes love the paintings
They are great.
Sean price brought me here
After the death of his father. Steve stopped painting and once wanted quit painting all together. He stated that he was in such pain he thought of committing suicide by flipping his car over. I'm glad he is still painting and teaching today.
STEVE <3
Miss you bob ross
I like the deadpool version better
2:10 and my meme source material has been located!
Acid and mushroom talk..lmao I love it
I didn't know that james hetfield is into painting too
Prince of asmr
1:02 tap it into those bristles *starts beating it harder then bob drys his brush
fuck people who disliked this
"Literally, Like Father Like Son. This!"
If James Hetfield and Bob Ross had a son
"afro dad, mullet son."
a
"Smooth talkin painter during the day, but at night he partys with Sam kinison and listens to ratt dokken poison and motley crue while snorting coke off of strippers. That's what that hairstyle says to me."
why Bob ross Mountain dont have Water reflection
Love this!
Amazing how is commentary on the news and how people are too tough on themselves still rings true today. Bob did a great job in raising his son ... His best masterpiece yet.
damn imagine bob ross being your dad
"I like that ""Compliment yourself a little...tell yourself you're wonderful....that's good for you""...that line made my day :-) thanks Steve"
That Van Dyke brown works everytime.
SAME 6 TECHNIQUES EVERY PAINTING
WHAT IS THIS SHIT
"the sound effects, you have to meke them"
That is some serious Mulletude!
^ Bob Ross got caught in the rain.
what if world was made by bob ross and his son
"Bob Ross: Trees
His Son: Mountains
wow"
Little known fact: he auditioned for Metallica before becoming a painter
"""Like dad says you dont gotta be crazy to do this but it helps."""
"If only he had bob on his name too

The show could continue a few more years :("
This is so relaxingg
Love from india
JAMES HEDFIELD IS THAT U?
How can you even dislike Bob Ross.
"Steve, you are doing great and I hope you will continue to do the very best. God bless you."
I just want to say I'm 35 years old but when I was in 8th grade I painted a family of elephants in Africa and got third place among high school students because of Bob Ross
I had no idea his son taught as well
I cannot decide who has better hair! Both are magical!
Came here to witness Steves mullet and Bob's merm
"""Yeah i pulled a sneaky on you""
He's just as wholesome as his dad."
"6:25 ""people are too hard on themselves these days""... Imagine the irony of living in 2021 and hearing that about back then..."
This happens when you cross Bob Ross with Farrah Fawcett.
Ross used the same recipe with a few changes.
"Didn't know 1980's James Hetfield painted.  But seriously, I really appreciate this.  Thanks."
Man he should've got his own show he's straight bob ross 2.0
"so awesome
TY"
He's a better painter than his dad.
5:50 ~ 6:55 I love this part!
I thought Steve was a young Bob Ross
"I couldn't help but laugh.
""I'm a quarter cherokee""
""INDIANS were very smart""

When Christopher Columbus discovered America, he thought he was in India, mistankingly calling Native Americans, Indians. He found out like 2 weeks later that he wasn't in India and that these were in fact not Indians...but WE STILL CALL THEM THAT!!!
""You guys aren't Indians?""
""No man totally different place.""
""Ah, your Indians....your Indians for hundreds of years later..""
-Louis C.K."
It sounds so satisfying
We need more people like him and his father in this world. Someone to make you feel that everything is going to be alright
Heaven to Heaven
Master # 2 from the Ross family
It magic from the mind to the brush how do they see it on canvas? Simple it from God
"Who else: 1) Didnt know they were father and son
                  2) Thought Steve called the legend, Dave? lol"
Bob is the people whisperer. He has a calming effect on all of us.
He made it look so easy. Amazing!
Bill Alexander master race.
"""I just pulled a sneaky on you"" said Dumbledore calmly.."
magic
like father like son
It's sad that he completely disappeared many people wanted him to carry on his dad's legacy and continue with the painting show but he never did shame really
"2:03 Referring to the west coast: ""People are really nice, too."" I'm sure in today's world the west coast woke brigade would manufacture some dirt on Steve and his dad."
I think I'd get the best sleep of my life if I passed out right after getting a hair cut while watching Bob Ross paint.
3:55 Think white. Got it.
hairstyle LOL ha ha ha
There's something about watching the Ross boys paint that is more relaxing than anything else you'll ever experience. Their tone of voice and cadence will put you in a frame of mind like nothing else will.
wow he is really good. thank you !
My youtube viewership is scripted.....I had no desire to watch this...
Bob's son James Hetfield is quite the painter.  You should hear him on guitar!
It is so amazing how this image just appears......
this is the American royal family.
"Rest In Peace bob! 
(If your dead..)"
Really miss you BOB - made many a saturday so peaceful while watching you create beautiful paintings and happy mistakes
Steve is good stuff. Bob would be proud.
Lol what a champion of a painters son. His hair is fantastic lol The 70s were a great time for hair lol
"Great hair. 
Peak 'fro and peak mullet."
Just like his Dad with the trees lol
Who else came to find out who the hell was in the thumbnail? All in the Family.
"- You dont need to be crazy to do this, but it helps - Best quote ever xD"
Was this recorded in 1980?
His hair and stache unironically cool as hell. Honestly think that style oughtta be brought back.
Is this Bob's son?
ASMR of the 90s
dude with 1 color he painted something I couldn't make in a lifetime
Was that Dan Aykroyd?
Why am I tearing up at midnight?
Off camera Bob beat the hide off his boy for embarrassing him with that skateboard story. Nobody makes fun of Bob Ross. Nobody. Not even blood.
Bob Ross and Rob Buss
I like watching Steve progress through the seasons. You can see just how much more comfortable he is on camera as the seasons go on!
Good to see James Hetfield taking some time away from Metallica to get in touch with his sensitive side
Its Axl Ross !!!
With feathered hair like that he should have 2 girlfriends.
"So Steve was a WWE champion turned painter in the late 80ies. Got it! Also, painted 10 seconds making it look it has taken days. Master! Like a living photoshop."
"Did PBS offer Steve a show? And if not, why??!"
Dude did 10 x strokes and 10 horizontal strokes and made a whole ocean view holy crap bruh.
Nice. Love it.
So wholesome honestly. I love all these videos.
"Like dad said, you don't have to be crazy to do this, but it helps."
I didn't know that James Hetfield painted so well.
"99.999% perfect content, i just wanted him to beat the devil out of it"
I wonder what Bob Rosses Fav color is
Hard to say who has the best haircut
"12:20
oh shit"
"The artistry here is remarkable.
Only thing I could ever draw was a beer from the tap..."
Millions of people can save billions of dollars on psychiatric treatment by just watching Bob Ross and son. Just sayin
"Holy 80s and early 90s, Batman. I love Bob Ross. RIP. What an artist he was. Props to mini Bob, too."
Absolutely astonishing. Been watching the joy of painting for almost 30 years. Never saw his son before.
"Bob Ross Viewer sequence: 
He messed it up
Wait no he didn't..
It was fine, but that definitely messed it up
Wait, he pulled it off.
Annnnd ...masterpiece.."
I just realized this show had 3 Bobs.
MULLET OF THE GODS!!!
The plumage on this family is top notch. I bet they attract all the mates they want. Just a spectacular display of their strong genetics.
"Everytime I thought the paint was done, he added something else and it got even better."
Mesmerized throughout the whole video
why would anybody dislike this
For when you need to paint quickly because you're late for your gig as the singer in a metallica cover band
I love it!
"Somewhere just off camera with a sawed of shotgun...... 
Go ahead and break from the script I wrote, I dare you.   ""0_o"""
I miss this stuff on PBS.
"At first glace I thought the thumbnail was of Hetfield's face, e.g. the ""Metallica""-era album face superimposed on BR's body."
I miss Him.
"Mountains AND clouds???? Wow, I was NOT expecting that"
"i saw the thumbnail and was like, bob with his hair down?!
naw its just his son i never knew he had lol."
And I thought Bob had good hair.
This is James Hetfield.
I pulled a little sneaky on ya. I never knew the origin of that meme until today
Amazing
I seen the clouds move I swear
Looks like he could be in 1980's Metalica.
Bob taught his son well :D
He has the patented Jaromir Jagr mullet.....winning!
2:44 that part of his painting was a beautiful painting.
Man James Hetfield can really paint.
"As a balding man, I envy that rock band hair"
tell your self you're wonderful. Man I really needed that not gonna lie.
These two look like they belong in a band.
"As someone who can't even draw a stick figure, this is pretty cool."
Guy did this in 25 minutes. Incredible.
RIP
"1993: he uses painting to escape bad news on TV.
2021: I wonder if he's still using that method."
I wonder if we can get Bob's entire series on disc.
Folks are nice out there. Boy. When WAS he on the West Coast?
I have to get in the shower but this is so relaxing
My first Bob Ross video and I'm not disappointed.(although it's his son)  I haven't felt this relaxed in a long time. Looking forward to more.
Bless this family
"I paint the exact same thing, but with a woman on fire, pulling her own flesh off, as she jumps into the lake.  But sometimes I am not in a good mood.  (Edit) And then my painting can get a little dark."
"Biggest glitch when your father ever make. The Picture not good if too much thing have. Clever anyway....
But u need another style ...."
That haircut
he dirtied up his hwhite
Gonna try this as soon as I get my nerve up.
I understand u because it from u dad
75% Mayan 25% spanish
From guatemala
I indian too very happy hear that me maya
Very professional
Love it like father like son great
With photography it the negatives with the drawing it the drawings from the penciled with sculpture it the hands and with painting it the strokes from the brush
"What awesome in life is photography , sculpture, drawing, painting is all trademark because it all original from the person who made it happen and u can sue for copyright"
Beautiful God blessed his son with his father bubble of life
I just have one question how do y put it on paper from the mind just like drawing.  sculpture with the hands. paint with a brush how do y see it I don't understand with photography it right there through a lens with me I feel it and see it that how I see it from my mind
Beautiful from the start to the finish congrats I love it because it came from your dad heart
Beautiful it Ross trademark of his world that we enjoyed and treasure because when I was little from the 70's he show me life through paint from his mind. And now to his son too
Anyone else click because they thought that was James hetfield?
"It literally was a finished, amazing painting of being out in the ocean, within 80 seconds of him starting."
"""im part Indian""

Yeah right wonder bread white boy"
Can you repeat the first stroke again please?
how the fuck can you dislike this
'When you are doing a cloud think like a cloud'-Shikamaru Nara
"""I think I will paint something with a big waterfall in it today, mountains and clouds""....Noooo!! Really??!!! I'm shocked by his originality."
"This is nothing short of astounding. I've been watching Bob Ross for years on Public Television, not only were his shows entertaining but also educational. His passion was passed on to his children. Not only did we lose a mentor but also a great human being. It's like watching Bob when he was younger, its a mirror image in style and demeanor. I will always love this family for what they give to us and ask nothing in return."
i pulled a sneaky on ya
Bob Ross Ft. Metallica
Life needs more positive and forgiving art. Thank you for this
That mullet needs its own museum.
"Bob Ross be like :
That's my son"
2:10 you are welcome
04:05 What if you have no hair can you still paint the cloud?
"Wow, he sold a painting at 12? He must be some kinda fuckn' genius! That must be why he destroys his bristles at 1:00."
Me: 1:03  hehehe
Why the quality looks like 1950
I wish I could see where he puts his brushes below the camera. He seems very organized.
"Wait, James Hetfield is the son of Bob Ross?"
I can't believe someone hasn't created a painting show starring Bob's son... it would be immensely successful
Apple  didn't fall far from  the  tree  here did it?
"Hmm...no way...this isn't bob ross.
This guy looks likes a rock star"
Me when I smoke marijuana. I go from Nutty to Bob Ross.
"What a haircut, outstanding"
"13:22 OMG, fucking mind blown"
I didn't know Bob Ross' son was the frontman for Metallica
"Cant wait to see Bob Ross's arch nemesis, Rob Boss."
Guys he pulled a sneaky on you 2:11
Of course Bob Ross's son rocks a mullet. OF COURSE.
it's like him
Bob must have been so proud of his happy little accident.
"""You don't have to be crazy to do that, but it helps..."""
"If I was Bob, I would be in tears. Like father, like son"
I love this family.
It all started with a thin coat of liquid white!
TFW when bob ross morphs into buffalo bill
"Bob Ross  my son is a quite a painter 
Steve draws a master piece"
Love him omgggg
I enjoyed this. Very much.
"If you dislike this video, you need some help."
"The way he looks,talk,and painting like his father ,like father like son"
Bob ross's son looks like one of the camera men stuck around after filming an episode and started  painting. He's good because after filming so many episodes he memorized all of the techniques
Just trying to picture Bob on a skateboard.
Omg a quarter native American....what a fuckin loser....
Bob still with him looking over his shoulder and whispering
The young man reminds me of Arlo Guthrie.
1993... Awesome.
"The flaky letter adversely drown because penalty cellularly obtain save a illegal cast. purple, uninterested gorilla"
I like how the son says stuff that still makes sense in 2021.
this is better than teraphy
What's with the hair with these dudes...
