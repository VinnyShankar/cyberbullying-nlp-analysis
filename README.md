## Note
This is the best damn team to ever do a group project. :tada:
## Dependencies
- This project requires a Python environment (version 3.7 and above)
- Run the `requirements.txt` file to install the necessary python packages
## Database Setup
- This project requires a MongoDB database, command line tools, and the MongoDB Compass App.
- Install pymongo to the development environment by activating the environment and running the command `pip install pymongo` in a terminal.
- MongoDB Installation instructions:
    - For MacOS, please refer to [the official MacOS documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/)
    - For Windows PC, please refer to [the offical Windows PC documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/)
- Mongosh Installation instructions:
    - For Mac: Run the following commands in a terminal:
        - `brew tap mongodb/brew`
        - `brew update`
        - `brew install mongodb-community@6.0`
        - `brew services start mongodb-community@6.0`
    - For Windows PC, please refer to [the offical Windows PC documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/install/)
- MongoDB Compass Installtion instructions: [Here](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass)
- Once MongoDB, the command line tools, and Compass are installed:
    - Launch the MongoDB Compass App and connect to localhost.
    - Run the `database.py` file in the code folder using the command `python database.py`
## How to deploy the Dashboard
- Connection to the local MongoDB database
- Open a terminal
- Activate the environment in which all the dependencies are installed
- Run the `app.py` file in the code folder using the command `python app.py`
## Activity Summary
1. Created a list of YouTube videos in a CSV file
2. Harvested comments for the videos through the YouTube API
3. Created and optimized a machine learning model to process the comments and drop spam
4. Used the [roberta pre-trained model](https://huggingface.co/roberta-base) to label each comment as neutral (0), negative (1), or positive (2)
5. Saved the cleaned and labeled comments in a JSON file and populated a local MongoDB database with the file
6. Used the cleaned and labeled comments to create and optimize four additional supervised learning models [Source](https://medium.com/@jays34955/finding-and-optimizing-a-good-text-classification-model-aea96d93d2fc)
7. Built a dashboard with a Python Flask API backend and JavaScript/HTML/CSS frontend
8. Used the MongoDB database to populate the dashboard
